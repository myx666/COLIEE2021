The Minister is under no obligation to do so. Thus, on judicial review, the Court must determine whether the Minister, or his statutory delegate, has properly exercised his discretion.

However, information circular 92-2 sets out guidelines, with examples of circumstances where cancelling or waiving interest may be warranted. Paragraph 3 of the guidelines emphasizes that these are only guidelines and are not meant to be exhaustive. Paragraph 5 lists examples of extraordinary circumstances, beyond the taxpayer's control, where interest may be cancelled or waived. Paragraph 6 lists instances where the interest arose primarily because of the actions of the CCRA. Finally, paragraph 7 lists examples where there is an inability to pay on the taxpayer's part. Again, the examples given in IC 92-2 are not meant to be exhaustive."], ["[11]", "The following factors were considered by Ms. Bemister in making her decision:", "(a) the request made by the Applicant and the reasons therefor;", "(b) the guidelines in Information Circular 92-2 ...;", "(c) the reasons for the application were not consistent with any of the guidelines;", "(d) the complexity of the legal issues which were the subject of the Objection and appeals;", "(e) the large quantity of information which was reviewed with respect to the Objection filed; and", "(f) from the receipt of the Notice of Reassessment the Applicant was aware of its liability.", "(Respondent's Record, Affidavit of Loretta Bemister, tab 2, para. 15)"], ["[12]", "There is no mention that Ms. Bemister considered the issue of delays allegedly caused by the CCRA or by the Tax Court in giving its decision or the delays while the case was before the Federal Court of Appeal division or the Supreme Court of Canada."], ["[13]", "The applicant contends that the decision-maker took into account irrelevant factors, the main one being that Metro-Can had known the amount of its tax liability since it was reassessed on June 1, 1993 and yet never made any payments. The applicant submits because it had filed Notices of Objection, it did not know the final amount of its liability and that this should not have been held against it."], ["[14]", "The applicant also relies on the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). In that case, one of the factors considered by the decision-maker was that the applicant did not dispute his liability. The Court held that the appellant did indeed dispute his liability as he had filed notices of objection.

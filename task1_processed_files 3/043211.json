It is not uncommon for highly qualified students, particularly those at the graduate level, to work for a year after completing their course of studies and apply for permanent residence status through visa offices in the USA. CIC views this development as a positive outcome.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Foreign students have the burden of proving to the satisfaction of officers that they are bona fide visitors.", "However, in these cases, the general question of bona fides is not so much whether the applicant is a prospective immigrant, but whether the applicant is a prospective illegal immigrant.", "\" (Emphasis added)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Background And The Visa", "Officer's Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "The applicants, brothers who are now 14 and 12, are citizens of India and live in New Delhi with their parents.

There was no other evidence which satisfied me that the Mittals were of greater means. I did not believe that persons of such apparently limited income would incur the expense of sending their children to Canada simply to attend elementary school.

The applicant could, however, receive an excellent education at a private school in India, and avoid crowded classrooms, at considerably less expense and inconvenience. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The visa officer's two reasons concerning the parents' insufficient income and the availability of less expensive private schooling in India will be considered in turn.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The Visa Officer's Finding", "Concerning Insufficient Funds  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "The applicants' material concerning the financing of their one-year academic stay in Canada was straightforward. Letters of acceptance for courses in grades 5 and 8 from their private school in Toronto establish partial payment of the $7,500 tuition fee for each student. A Canadian chartered bank confirmed that it held $10,000 in mutual fund investments for each child. The applicants' uncle and aunt who reside in Scarborough, Ontario undertook to provide all material support during their stay in Canada. The applicants have previously visited these relatives in Canada and would live with them while attending school here. The same chartered bank confirmed that it employed the uncle as an Account Manager-Commercial Banking at an annual salary of $43,300, not including bonuses.

Tuition fees vary between jurisdictions, and may be as high as $10,000. Student authorizations may not, therefore, be refused to minors who do not present proof of payment of tuition fees. A student authorization may not, however, be issued unless the applicant provides a letter of acceptance from the appropriate educational authorities. The onus, therefore, is on the provinces, and not on CIC officers, to ensure their school boards and divisions include provisions for the payment of fees as a pre-condition to the issuance of acceptance letters. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Section 4.11.1 of the", "Guideline", "suggests that student authorizations for primary and secondary schooling usually be issued on a year-to-year basis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "This visa officer received other information concerning the business and land investments of the applicants' father to establish the family's roots in India.

The record clearly establishes that the applicants had the \"sufficient financial resources\" for the one-year period for which the student authorizations were sought.

Firstly, the record discloses no information concerning the availability and the quality of private schooling in India.

While a question was certified in", "Wong", "and the matter is now pending before the Court of Appeal, Justice Gibson's views concerning the temporary purpose inherent in a student's visa issued for one year are worthy of repetition:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Such an application is for permission for a clearly 'temporary purpose'. It is in the nature of student visas that they are issued for limited periods of time. If the minor applicant, together with his family, concluded in the future that he wished to continue to pursue his studies in Canada, a renewal of his visa or a new visa would be required. It would be open to the respondent to examine the totality of the circumstances each time that the minor applicant applied for renewal or a new visa. If, at any stage during the course of the minor applicant's education it became apparent that the minor applicant's ties to Hong Kong had so deteriorated as to demonstrate that they were insufficient to ensure his return there, then refusal of the request for renewal or for a new visa would clearly be justified.\" [see footnote 9]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "This approach is consistent with the statute and its regulations.

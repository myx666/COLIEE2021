Poopak is a permanent Canadian resident and received financial support from her parents. The Applicants submit that Poopak abandoned her studies in Iran in order to enter a new program in Canada. Poopak has been continuously enrolled at the University of British Columbia since September 2004. The Applicants submit that if the family is to stay together they must stay in Canada or Poopak must return to Iran. This latter choice would be against Poopak's best interests. The Applicants submit that this important H & C consideration was not even considered by the IAD. I would add that no evidence was generated that Poopak would have to return to Iran. I believe it would be her choice."], ["[15]", "The Applicants submit that they suffered a miscarriage of justice by way of the representation they received from their prior counsel."], ["[16]", "The Applicants very strongly submit that their prior counsel, an immigration consultant named Mr. Hadad, was incompetent and that but for Mr. Hadad's unprofessional errors there is a reasonable chance the Applicants would have received a different result in their appeal."], ["[17]", "The Applicants submit that their immigration consultant failed to assist the Applicants in addressing the H & C grounds that were the sole ground of appeal at the IAD hearing.

It must be shown that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would be different ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[21]", "The Applicants submit that the Applicants suffered prejudice and that a miscarriage of justice occurred."], ["[22]", "The Respondent submits that the IAD did not err in failing to examine the best interests of the child.

The Respondent notes that the basis of the IAD's decision was its finding that the Applicants voluntarily abandoned Canada. The Applicants have not shown that any act or omission of Mr. Hadad's would change this key conclusion."], ["[30]", "The Respondent also submits that the Applicants have not established that the hearing was procedurally unfair. Mr. Hadad's alleged incompetence on direct examination does not, according to the Respondent, lead to a finding of a miscarriage of justice. Both the Presiding Member and Minister's counsel questioned the Applicants on all issues that reasonably might be expected to be relevant to a claim based on H & C grounds. The questions related to the Applicants' establishment in Canada, the presence of relatives in Canada, the Applicants' plans for the future, the past and present circumstances of the Applicants and their daughters, and the reasons why the Applicants returned to Iran in 1986 and did not return to Canada until 2003. All the potentially relevant issues regarding the Applicants' claim were canvassed during the IAD hearing.

Counsel for the Applicants wrote to the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants in a letter dated August 15, 2005, in which counsel complained of Mr. Hadad's treatment of the Applicants and others, and requested that the CSIC immediately prohibit Mr. Hadad from practicing as an immigration consultant."], ["[32]", "The letter was dated August 15, 2005, but the Applicants commenced this action in March. This does not pose a problem for the Applicants. The Courts have required a letter to a governing body as a form of corroborating evidence of allegations of incompetence. Courts do not wish to entertain assertions of incompetence without some supporting evidence ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) at para. 19;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 8). The letter provides sufficient corroborating evidence, and provided sufficient notice of the allegation to the Applicants' former counsel. In addition, the Respondent wrote directly to Mr. Hadad in a letter dated October 12, 2005. This letter would have provided Mr. Hadad with sufficient time to consider responding to the allegations made by the plaintiffs in this matter."], ["[33]", "The Court is therefore able to proceed to examine the Applicants' allegations of Mr. Hadad's incompetence."], ["[34]", "In my opinion the Applicants have failed to show that there was a reasonable probability that but for Mr. Hadad's incompetence, the result of the IAD hearing would have been different ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 26, and by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) at para. 15)."], ["[35]", "A reading of the IAD Transcript demonstrates that Mr. Hadad was unfamiliar with the IAD hearing procedure. However, the Applicants were still able to present their case. The Applicants' submissions did not displace the IAD's finding that the Applicants voluntarily abandoned Canada, nor did the Applicants provide any relevant H & C grounds for the IAD to consider. The only major ground which the Applicants claim Mr. Hadad should have raised was a best interests of the child consideration. Since I find in the reasons that follow that the best interests of the child argument would not have altered the result of the hearing, the Applicants have failed to demonstrate that the result of the hearing would have been different but for Mr. Hadad's alleged incompetence."], ["[36]", "Since I am satisfied the Applicants have not shown prejudice, the Court will not examine Mr. Hadad's performance to determine whether it amounted to incompetence ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 29). The Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants has received the Applicants' complaint against Mr. Hadad, and is an appropriate body to determine whether Mr. Hadad's conduct fell below the range of reasonable assistance. This may provide the Applicants alternate relief against their former representative ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) at para. 23)."], ["[37]", "It is clear from the facts of this case that the IAD did not err in failing to consider the best interests of the child. Poopak Shirvan was born July 26, 1983. She was therefore of 19 years of age or older both at the time of the initial determination made by the immigration officer in December 2003 and at the time of the IAD hearing. The IAD did not err in its decision to not consider the best interests of the Applicants' daughter ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 12-14).

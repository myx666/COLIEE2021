Further to issues relating to the payment for Mr. Gudiel's work, Mr. Cinco de Lena threatened him with death.

Noting that, over a period of twelve years, his family members had been leaving El Salvador for the United States, and given the credibility issues, the RPD did not believe that the troubles apparently suffered by Mr. Gudiel's siblings and children were related to Mr. Gudiel's alleged issues with Mr. Cinco de Lena. However, due to Mr. Gudiel's lack of formal education and his emotional and mental challenges outlined in the psychological assessment in evidence, the RPD did not draw a negative inference regarding any of the alleged facts that were marred with discrepancies with respect to dates and specific spatial contexts in Mr. Gudiel's story."], ["[11]", "The RPD found that despite the credibility concerns, the determinative issue was state protection. The RPD outlined the principles regarding state protection and reviewed the documentary evidence on El Salvador at length, acknowledging that there were inconsistencies in the totality of the documentary evidence. The RPD was not persuaded that the state authorities in El Salvador were not taking action against the MS 13 and other criminal gangs. The RPD found that the authorities were making serious efforts to contain the criminality, particularly those perpetrated by the MS 13 gang, and were achieving results. The RPD further found that Mr. Gudiel's evidence about the deficient protection from the police was anecdotal, that his own evidence and his own experiences rather suggested a positive response from the El Salvador police to his complaints, and that the police were willing to investigate.

This is not a situation where the decision-maker failed to state the risk, used vague language to describe it or conflated individual reasons for heightened risk with a generalized risk faced by a larger group. I do not see anything to indicate that the RPD did not reasonably set out and apply the test under section 97. The RPD clearly identified Mr. Gudiel's risk in the second paragraph of the decision, noting that he feared returning to El Salvador due to the perceived threats from Mr. Cinco de Lena, the MS 13 gang and other individuals relating to it. Throughout the decision, the RPD referred to the particular situation and circumstances of Mr. Gudiel in the context of his individualized fears.

At paragraph 26 of its decision, the RPD stated that \"[w]hile the effectiveness of the protection is a relevant consideration, the preponderance of recent Federal Court decisions has held that the test for a finding of state protection is whether the protection is adequate, rather than effective per se.\" Mr. Gudiel affirms that, by doing so, the RPD used and applied the wrong test as it failed to determine whether adequate state protection was", "actually", "provided in El Salvador."], ["[23]", "I disagree. Instead, I conclude that, when the decision is read as a whole, the RPD correctly applied the state protection test, considered the particular situation of Mr. Gudiel and looked at whether the protection offered by El Salvador actually worked and yielded concrete results. I find that the approach of the RPD was reasonable and that it committed no reviewable error in conducting its state protection analysis."], ["[24]", "It is settled law that courts in Canada must presume that state protection is available in the country of origin. The onus always lies on the applicant to rebut the presumption with \"clear and convincing proof of a state's inability to protect\" (REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). As pointed out by Mr. Gudiel, the state protection test focuses not only on the efforts of the state but also on actual results. This has been expressed in terms of the adequacy of state protection: \"[i]t is what state protection is actually provided at the present time that is relevant\" (REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). Several cases have indeed affirmed that the proper test for state protection goes beyond the existence of mere serious efforts and requires adequate measures in terms of what is actually accomplished by the state (REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[25]", "I pause to note that counsel for Mr. Gudiel appears to try to distinguish between what is \"adequate\" protection and what is protection \"effective at an operational level\". There is indeed a line of jurisprudence from this Court suggesting that \"adequate\" may be different from \"effective\"; however, these cases do not dispute that the protection needs to yield actual results (REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). A protection that is adequate is a protection that works at the operational level. Adequacy of state protection has been held to mean that the RPD has to consider the state's capacity to implement measures at the operational or practical level for the persons concerned (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[26]", "In the present case, there is no merit to the argument that the RPD erred or failed to do that. On the contrary, the RPD in fact concluded that state protection in El Salvador was adequate and effectively worked. In his submissions, Mr. Gudiel tries to use case law and selected passages from the RPD's reasons to support the argument that an incorrect test was applied. But the Court must consider the reasons as a whole. Based on its detailed review of two information requests, the RPD mentioned the intents and efforts made by the authorities in El Salvador but also considered how the country currently provided adequate state protection to its citizens and how the police were both willing and able to effectively protect them."], ["[27]", "The RPD's decision did not only refer to the new anti-gang legislation considered by El Salvador, to its enactment and to its implementation in the country.

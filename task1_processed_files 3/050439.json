It is a fundamental tenet of criminal law that the victim of crime is society as a whole, not just the individual victim; once a criminal complaint has been filed, the complainant does not have the possibility of unilaterally deciding to pardon the accused, it is up to the prosecutor, a representative of society as a whole, to decide whether or not to drop the charges.

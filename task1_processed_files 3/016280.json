This decision is based on the complaint alone. The Board is entitled to dismiss the complaint if it believes that the allegations are insufficient to warrant a formal hearing. I note that the", "Act", "is silent on whether the decision must be made by consensus, or whether it can be made by a simple majority.

In the case at bar, it is undisputed that the Board had the statutory authority to dismiss the applicants' complaint at the first step of the hearing. However, what is being challenged is the fact that the Board reached its decision after hearing the opinion of the CEO. At issue here is not the substance of the decision itself, but rather, the manner in which it was reached. In this regard, contrary to the respondent's submission, the fact that the", "Act", "has a privative clause is not relevant to the question at issue of whether the Board acted fairly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "In my opinion, it was improper for the CEO and the DRO to have been present and to have made representations at the initial meeting of the Board. The presence of the CEO and the DRO cannot be characterized as neutral. Although Mr. Turner and Ms. Chamakese did not have an interest in seeing one candidate succeed over another, they did have an interest in convincing the Board that the election they oversaw was conducted legally. They were not impartial observers. This is evident from the minutes of the meeting where the sentiments of the CEO are expressed as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"He regretted that there were suggestions in the Appeal document that stated the Election was held on the basis of illegal and corrupt practices. He stated he was personally accused of this and that his integrity was questioned. He stated he had run several elections before and never experienced such false accusations.\" Respondent's Record at 51.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "Furthermore, Mr. Turner provided each member of the Board with a document entitled \"Response to the Notice of Appeal to the General Election held on February 28th, 2001 \". This document set forth Mr. Turner's opinion that the appeal was without merit and should be dismissed summarily in the absence of a formal hearing. This type of information should only have been provided at the formal Appeal hearing, where the applicants would have had an opportunity to present their case and an equal opportunity to respond.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the applicant was denied a formal hearing based on contradictory evidence that had been submitted to the Tribunal. Sharlow, J., determined that not giving the applicant the opportunity to respond to contradictory evidence deprived him of a fundamental right that made the proceeding unfair to him. This, she points out would be true even if the evidence would have come from a neutral observer such as the CEO. She stated at paras. 63 and 64:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"I do not suggest that the Tribunal members should have been forbidden from attending the election and the count. But having done so, it was unfair for them to then rely on their own personal knowledge when determining that Mr. Lavallee's appeals had no merit, without first giving him fair notice of the factual evidence that contradicted his allegations. He should have been allowed to respond to that contradictory evidence before the Tribunal decided whether any or all of his three appeals warranted a hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"I would go further and say that even if the contradictory evidence had come from someone other than the Tribunal members, such as a neutral observer like Mr. Louison as Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Lavallee in fairness should have been told about that evidence, and should have been given an opportunity to respond to it before the Tribunal determined whether an appeal hearing was warranted. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "Similarly, in the case at bar, I believe that it was improper for the Board to hear the opinion of Mr. Turner without giving the applicants an opportunity to respond.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "In summary, I am of the view that the Board was not properly constituted as there were only four members present instead of the required five and the Board failed to observe procedural fairness by hearing the opinion of the CEO and DRO while not providing the applicants an equal opportunity to respond.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "This application for judicial review is allowed.

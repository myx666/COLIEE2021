The applicants were called to an interview on March 2, 1998, for a hearing of their citizenship applications. At that hearing the citizenship judge indicated that she had not reviewed the residency question­naires that the applicants had submitted and that she needed time to do so. The appli­cants' physical presence in Canada was 338 days (Shun Yee Elsie Chan) and 441 days (Chi Koon Ralph Ma) short of the 1095 required between May 6, 1994, and May 8, 1997. Thus, the question became whether any of the days of physical absence should be counted as deemed residence within the country."], ["[6]", "The citizenship judge declined to make a decision at the time and indicated that she would be in touch with counsel.

On March 3, 1998, the applicants had returned to Hong Kong where they were working and where they had a young son.

At the end of the interview counsel for the applicants indicated to the citizenship judge that if she wished to interview his clients further, they were pre­pared to attend. The citizenship judge responded by saying that she would fax counsel a list of questions for his clients to answer and once she received the answers she would decide whether another hearing was necessary. Approximately two hours later a message was received in counsel's office that the judge was going to render her decision without waiting for further enquiry; this she did."], ["[8]", "The question then arises as to what remedy is appropriate in these circumstances.

Counsel for the respondent argues that the applicants were required to submit to me by affidavit the evidence they would have presented to the citizenship judge had the hearing been continued, so that I could make a final decision on the citizenship applications, albeit not on the basis of viva voce evidence.

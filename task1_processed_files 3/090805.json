She moved from Nigeria to Italy in 1997. In 1999, she became romantically involved with Mr. Pace, the owner of her dwelling in Verona, Italy. The Applicant married Mr. Pace in 2001. His children were opposed to the marriage because of the age difference between their father (69) and the Applicant (26)."], ["[3]", "The Applicant's marriage deteriorated over time. Mr. Pace drank excessively and became verbally and physically abusive. In 2005, an incident occurred in which the Applicant was slapped and beaten by her husband and his children. The Applicant hid at a friend's house, but returned home soon thereafter when her husband threatened to withdraw his sponsorship for Italian citizenship."], ["[4]", "The Applicant became an Italian citizen in August, 2005. Around this time she began having an affair with Mr. Uyi, who she had met while staying with a friend. The Applicant discovered she was pregnant with Mr. Uyi's baby. Upon learning of this pregnancy, her husband threatened to kill her if the baby was not his. The Applicant was concerned because Mr. Pace had connections to the mafia."], ["[5]", "Because of the pregnancy, the Applicant was also threatened by Mr. Uyi and her father. She felt she could not return to Nigeria.

The RPD's determination centered on an adverse finding of credibility."], ["[7]", "The RPD determined that there were \"a number of serious discrepancies\" between the Applicant's oral testimony, her Personal Information Form (PIF), and other evidence. One such example of these inconsistencies occurred when the Applicant failed to mention the allegedly \"severe injuries\" she sustained at the hands of her husband and his children in her PIF. According to the RPD, \"if [she] had been severely injured during the incident, I would have expected her to mention that in the PIF.\" Moreover, the RPD found that the Applicant was evasive in giving testimony, and required that questions be repeated before providing an answer."], ["[8]", "Furthermore, the Applicant failed to mention Mr. Pace's mafia connections to the immigration officer upon her arrival to Canada in December, 2007; nor did she mention these connections in her original PIF filed in 2008, or the PIF amendments filed by her former counsel. Rather, the alleged mafia connections were not mentioned until July, 2008. The RPD was not satisfied with the Applicant's explanation that she had told her counsel about this information and \"thought that it had been mentioned,\" since this aspect became one of the most significant parts of her claim after it had been brought to light. With regard to this omission from the PIF, the RPD found that \"to not notice, or notice, and then not insist on an immediate correction, the total omission of the very basis for the ability of the alleged agent of persecution to hurt her makes absolutely no sense at all.\""], ["[9]", "The RPD also had doubts as to the existence of the Applicant's friend Juliet, since Juliet is not an Italian name, despite the usage of the name in the \"famous story 'Romeo and Juliet'\" which is set in Verona.

The RPD noted that this had not been mentioned in any \"version of her story.\" The Applicant, however, stated that she meant that Mr. Pace \"was in the mafia and had connections everywhere.\" The RPD was not satisfied by this explanation."], ["[11]", "The Applicant stated in oral testimony that Juliet made all the arrangements for her to flee Italy and took her to the airport. However, the Applicant told the immigration officer upon arrival in Canada that Mr. Pace had taken her to the airport. When asked to explain this discrepancy, the Applicant stated that since the immigration officer had become suspicious about her travelling without her spouse during the holidays while pregnant, she made up the fact that Mr. Pace took her to the airport. In response to the RPD's determination that suspicions had not arisen until later in the interview with the immigration officer, the Applicant explained that she was scared at the time. The RPD did not understand why the Applicant felt the need to lie with regard to who had taken her to the airport if the immigration officer had not yet become suspicious of her."], ["[12]", "Furthermore, while the Applicant stated that she was told to flee to Canada to make a refugee claim, she did not make a claim immediately upon her arrival. Rather, she said that she was coming for a visit. The RPD noted that it was only after being detained for some time that she filed a refugee claim. The RPD was not convinced by the Applicant's explanation that Juliet had told her not to make a claim at the airport and that she was scared of being deported."], ["[13]", "The Applicant's counsel conceded that everything the Applicant told the immigration officer upon her arrival in Canada was false. The RPD found that the Applicant \"attempted to adopt at least some of this false information in her own testimony before me,\" including an instance in which the Applicant \"lied repeatedly to the immigration officer and then attempted to explain the lies with an explanation that just does not make sense\" with regard to an alleged acquaintance."], ["[14]", "The Applicant also provided a letter that was allegedly written by her father. The RPD did not find this letter credible because of its friendly tone at the beginning which then \"degenerates into death threats.\" Other aspects of the letter were suspicious to the RPD as well, including the way in which Mr. Pace's name was written, and a typographical error within the letter which read \"this is the voice of my your father Paul.\" The RPD found that it appeared that the Applicant had written the letter herself and had forgotten to erase the word \"my\" with reference to her father. It held that the letter was a forgery."], ["[15]", "Although the Applicant's counsel explained that any difficulties with regard to the Applicant's testimony should be considered in light of the abuse she faced in Nigeria, the RPD found that \"no actual medical evidence was presented\" to corroborate the Applicant's story of having her genitals mutilated and having her father pour scalding water over her during this procedure. Rather, only a photograph of the Applicant with a substance smeared on her thighs was presented to the RPD.

However, the envelope reveals nothing more than that the envelope came from Nigeria, and it was the peculiarities in the letter itself that caused the RPD to rule that it was forged. The Applicant has not adequately accounted for the strangeness of the letter. Although she has suggested cultural and educational issues to try and explain away the problem, the RPD, not unreasonably, concluded that it did not accept her explanations. Whether or not the letter came from Nigeria, I cannot say that the Board's conclusions on its authenticity were unreasonable, or that the Board's failure to specifically mention the envelope and its apparent origin gives rise to a reviewable error."], ["[53]", "In any event, the letter is only one issue in a Decision that cites many inconsistencies in evidence and evasiveness in demeanour."], ["[54]", "In the end, the Applicant's claim is based on the allegation that the RPD was not alert and alive to her vulnerable circumstances as a woman and failed to apply the Gender Guidelines.

Due to a serious attrition of its population through disease, etc., and a similar attrition of the population of the nearby Pheasant's Rump Band, these two bands in 1901 surrendered their reserves which were disposed of by the Crown. For all practical purposes the bands ceased to exist as organizations, their remaining members moving onto the reserve of White Bear Indian Band No. 70 and becoming members of that band. In 1952 elections for the White Bear Band Council were brought under the", "Indian Act", ", R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, by an order of the Governor-in-Council pursuant to the equivalent of the present s. 74 of the", "Act"], ["[4]", "There had been for some time evidence of irregularities in the surrender or disposition of the Ocean Man and Pheasant's Rump reserves in 1901, and in the 1970's the White Bear Band brought an action against Her Majesty in respect of these matters. This action was settled by an agreement between Her Majesty and the White Bear Band signed in January 1986, a settlement (the \"Settlement Agreement\") which was approved by members of the White Bear Band through referendum. The Settlement Agreement provided for the government to pay the White Bear Band some sixteen million dollars, such money to be held in a trust (the \"Main Trust\") established by a Trust Agreement which accompanied the agreement. The Settlement Agreement, paragraph 10, contemplated that the Minister would establish two additional bands if requested to do so, respectively, by members of the White Bear Band who were descendants of the former Ocean Man Band and of the former Pheasant's Rump Band. Some 8.4 million dollars of the funds to be held in trust were to be spent to acquire reserve lands for these two restored bands. Any request for the establishment of such bands had to be made within two years after the Settlement Agreement was approved. The accompanying Main Trust provided that if there were an agreement within the White Bear Band as to the division of the assets of the trust, the trustees would be obliged to give effect to that agreement."], ["[5]", "As best I can ascertain from the material, steps were then taken to negotiate what came to be called the Internal Settlement Agreement. In May 1987, the White Bear Band elected three negotiating committees, the White Bear Negotiating Committee, the Pheasant's Rump Negotiating Committee, and the Ocean Man Negotiating Committee. (All of the defendants except Daniel Bigstone were members of the Ocean Man Negotiating Committee.) As a result of the work of these negotiating committees, the Internal Settlement Agreement (\"ISA\") was signed on May 15, 1989 and it was approved by referendum by members of the White Bear Band in September 1989, approval in this form being required by the original Settlement Agreement between Her Majesty and the White Bear Band. The \"parties\" to this Internal Settlement Agreement were the negotiating committees (apparently all chosen by the membership at large of the White Bear Band) representing respectively the future Pheasant's Rump Band, the future Ocean Man Band, and the continuing White Bear Band, together with the trustees of the Main Trust. Generally speaking, the ISA provided that the \"Ocean Man\" and \"Pheasant's Rump\" would, within six months from the referendum approving the ISA, request the Minister to recognize their bands in accordance with para. 10 of the Settlement Agreement. It will be noted that the ISA did not specify who was to make these requests, simply stating that they were to be in accordance with the Settlement Agreement \"and in particular para. 10 thereof\" (described above). Thus the ISA presumably contemplated that the request was to be made by members of the White Bear Band who were descendants of the Pheasant's Rump and Ocean Man Bands respectively and who the Minister would accept as such. The ISA provided for the money held in trust for land acquisition to be used to acquire lands for the two re-established bands up to the amount which they had had prior to surrender in 1901. The ISA also provided for a transition period of three years from the date of referendum approval (that is, three years commencing in September 1989) during which time members of the White Bear Band electing to become members of the Pheasant's Rump or Ocean Man Bands could continue to live on the White Bear Reserve and enjoy certain rights and privileges there other than the right to vote or to hold office in the White Bear Band. Within that three year period the respective Ocean Man and Pheasant's Rump negotiating committees were to request the Minister to re-establish their bands on the reserve lands acquired pursuant to the Settlement and the ISA Agreement. For the purposes of White Bear members electing to join either of the other bands, the critical date was not the day of re-establishment on the reserves but the date of recognition of the restored bands by the Minister: any member of the White Bear Band could, up to 120 days after that date transfer his membership to either the Ocean Man or the Pheasant's Rump Band."], ["[6]", "Unfortunately the ISA is deficient in not spelling out more clearly the role of the Ocean Man Negotiating Committee in the transitional process leading to the re-establishment of a Band Council. If it had done so, the present proceedings would probably never have been brought. As nearly as I can understand the ISA from several readings of it, the only interim functions which the Negotiating Committee was specifically given to perform on behalf of the Ocean Man Band were to request the Minister to re-establish the band on the reserves acquired under the agreements (para. 6(d)), to refer disputes arising under the ISA to an arbitrator (s. 9(1)), and to have their legal fees paid out of the Main Trust (s. 18). It is clear from her affidavit that the defendant Laura Big Eagle, present Chief of the Ocean Man Band, misconceived the mandate given to her and her colleagues on the Ocean Man Negotiating Committee: in her affidavit in support of the defendants in the present proceedings she states that under that agreement", "\"we were conferred with almost unlimited authority ... and could have dealt with the affairs of the Ocean Man Band during the three year transition period provided for in the Internal Settlement Agreement ...\"", "I fail to see the grant of any such broad authority by the ISA."], ["[7]", "As early as September 1988, the members of the Ocean Man Negotiating Committee had incorporated a company called Ocean Man Developments Ltd., of which they were directors. This corporation was established to manage land which was being purchased for their future restored band by the Main Trust pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. At some point the Negotiating Committee also established something called the Ocean Man Trust although the origins and mandate of that trust are not clear to me."], ["[8]", "The Ocean Man Negotiating Committee proceeded, after approval of the ISA in a referendum, to take the necessary steps to have the band re-established. It made a request to this effect and the Minister of Indian Affairs reconstituted the Ocean Man Band on August 23, 1990. (This triggered the deadline for transfers of members of the White Bear Band to the Ocean Man Band, such deadline being December 21, 1990, 120 days after re-establishment of the band.) On September 20, 1990 the Governor-in-Council set aside lands for the Ocean Man Band thus establishing it on a reserve. In the meantime the Committee had busied itself drafting a constitution for the band. On June 22, 1990 it sent out to Ocean Man Band members (presumably those who had already indicated that they wished to join the band although it had not yet been formally re-established) copies of the proposed constitution and other information. On July 9-10, 1990 a meeting of \"band members\" was held and some discussion ensued as to the constitution. From then until November 1990, the Negotiating Committee carried out a programme of individual interviews with members of the band taking to them a copy of the constitution and seeking their written approval of it. No general meeting of the band was held to obtain approval nor was a referendum held among members of the band on the subject of the constitution. Furthermore the sequence of events by which the constitution was \"approved\" and the first election held is not very clear and appears to lack logic and good order. Again, the present dispute could I believe have been avoided if more care had been taken with designing and carrying out this process. By the terms of the ISA, approved by referendum, members of the White Bear Band had 120 days after re-establishment of the Ocean Man Band (i.e., until December 21, 1990) to declare themselves members of the Ocean Man Band. It would have been far preferable if the draft constitution had contemplated the completion of that process and the establishment of a definitive band list before approval had to be sought of the constitution and an election held thereunder. (Unfortunately, the Committee designed the constitution in such a way that, by s. 5 of the provisions for election of a Band Council, the announcement of an election had to be issued within a month of the re-establishment of the Band, an event which by other provisions would precede by 120 days the finalization of the first band list. This meant that to be meaningful the constitution had to be brought into operation shortly after re-establishment of the band if the first election were to be called, as contemplated in the constitution, within one month of re-establishment.) Instead all three processes were carried out simultaneously: completion of transfers from White Bear to Ocean Man band membership, approval of the constitution, and the holding of an election. The parties do not seem to be clear as to the date when the election was called. All we know of the election process is that a nominating meeting was held on November 18th, a candidates' forum was held on November 30th, and the election itself was completed on December 21, 1990 (the very day which was the deadline for transfers of membership from the White Bear Band). It appears to be common ground that, prior to the election being called, at least 75 persons had signed a document indicating their approval of the constitution and only four disapproved. According to Chief Laura Big Eagle, the number approving represented 60% of the eligible electors of the band, as by the criteria of the constitution 125 persons ultimately elected to join Ocean Man Band. There is a dispute as to whether a majority of those who had voted for the constitution prior to the election being called were actually qualified to do so. The most serious allegation made by the plaintiffs is that 25 of those who signed in favour were at the time members of the White Bear Band. I am unable to resolve this conflict in the evidence in a proceeding such as the present one. I am also not persuaded, on the evidence submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs thus far, that because some who voted in favour were still shown as members on the White Bear Band list they had not become members of the Ocean Man Band or were entitled to become members and have their name appear on the Ocean Man Band list. Section 2 of the", "Indian Act", "defines \"member of a band\" as \"a person whose name appears on a band list", "or who is entitled to have his name appear on a band list", "\". In the absence of specific argument on this point, it appears to me highly plausible that by paras. 6(1)(b) and 11(1)(b) and s. 11(4) of the", "Act", "those members of the White Bear Band who had elected to become members of Ocean Man Band were entitled to have their names appear on the Ocean Man Band list which was still, presumably, to be prepared by the department. When so prepared, these names would be deleted from the White Bear Band list in accordance with s. 13 of the", "Act"], ["[9]", "A basic problem with the plaintiffs' position appears to me to be their assumption that the band list (particularly the White Bear Band list) should be determinative of who was entitled to vote for or against the new constitution of a separate, re-established band. As I understand the", "Indian Act", ", the band list while very important is not conclusive for all purposes as to who is entitled to the benefits of band membership. This is implied in the definition of \"member of a band\" referred to above. Many of the provisions of the", "Act", "accordingly refer to various rights and responsibilities of a \"member of a band\" which by definition include those not already on a band list as long as they are entitled to be on such list. There is at least one situation where inclusion on a band list is imperative, namely to qualify as an \"elector\" (as defined in s. 2) for the purposes of voting in an election under s. 74 of the", "Act", ". But there was no such election involved in the present case."], ["[10]", "The constitution for the first time specifically gave the Ocean Man Negotiating Committee a clear mandate to act as an interim band council until the election of a band council. If the constitution was validly approved prior to the election being called (a matter to be addressed below), the Negotiating Committee was authorized under the approved constitution to take the steps it did including the calling of the election. In that election all of the defendants except Marion Standingready were elected councillors. Of those elected, all but the defendant Daniel Bigstone had been members of the Negotiating Committee."], ["[11]", "It appears to me that the election was carried out in accordance with the constitution and indeed the plaintiffs participated in various ways in the election process. All but Joy Mann-Sheepskin were at the nominating meeting. The plaintiff Peter Bigstone was nominated to run for Chief and he nominated another candidate. The plaintiff Robert Sunkawasti nominated two other candidates for the office of councillor, including the husband of the plaintiff Joy Mann-Sheepskin and the defendant Marion Standingready. The plaintiff Aletha Sunkawasti was nominated as a candidate for the office of councillor. The plaintiffs who were candidates gave speeches at the candidates' forum on November 30, 1990. The plaintiff Joy Mann-Sheepskin, although she was not at the nominating meeting, admitted on cross-examination that she had participated fully in the election process and tried to get various of her relatives to vote in the election. Neither the plaintiff Peter Bigstone nor the plaintiff Aletha Sunkawasti succeeded as candidates for the position of councillor. Apart from acceptance of the constitution through participation in the election held thereunder, three of the plaintiffs also participated in the election of trustees of the Ocean Man Trust provided for in the constitution and one of them Aletha Sunkawasti, was elected a trustee of that Trust on August 19, 1991."], ["[12]", "It must be recognized, however, that shortly after the election of December 21, 1990, the plaintiffs together with John Sheepskin brought a petition before the Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan to have the election declared void. The learned judge, Kyle, J., requested written submissions on the question of jurisdiction of that court in the matter, and the petition was not pursued further. Instead the plaintiffs filed the present action in this court on February 10, 1991. In it the plaintiffs seek a declaration that the defendants are not the Chief and band council of the Ocean Man Band, an order declaring that the constitution is void, the appointment of a receiver-manager for the purpose of managing the affairs of the band until an election of a Chief and council is held in accordance with s. 74 of the", "Indian Act", ", an order that the court appointed receiver manager manage the affairs of the band until this claim is disposed of, an order that an election be held in accordance with s. 74 of the", "Indian Act", ", an order requiring the defendants to pay any money received from the Main Trust into court pending the disposition of this action, an injunction restraining the defendants from acting as the band council or exercising its powers pending disposition of the action, an order requiring the defendants to account for all funds received and spent while they exercised the powers of the band council, as trustees of Ocean Man Band, and as directors of Ocean Man Developments Ltd."], ["[13]", "The defendants applied for leave to file a conditional appearance in order that they could contest the jurisdiction of the court, and leave to file a conditional appearance was granted on consent on October 11, 1991.

As far as I can see, the", "Indian Act", "is silent on the matter. Subsection 74(1) provides as follows:", "\"74(1) Whenever he deems it advisable for the good government of a band, the Minister may declare by order that after a day to be named therein the council of the band, consisting of a chief and councillors, shall be selected by elections to be held in accordance with this Act.\"", "The section then goes on to make certain provisions for the constitution of a band council whose election is governed under the", "Act", "by virtue of an order made by the Minister under s. 74(1). But in the present case there has been no such order made by the Minister in respect of the Ocean Man Band. Prior to its disappearance in 1901, the band operated under band custom in respect of elections although the evidence as to what that custom was is very limited. It is true that in about 1952 the White Bear Band, to which most of the present Ocean Man Band members then belonged, was made the subject of an order under the equivalent of present s. 74(1). But I fail to see how that order can be deemed to apply to a legally distinct band, the re-established Ocean Man Band, whose members had to elect to abandon the White Bear Band when becoming members of the Ocean Man Band. (The ISA, which was approved by a referendum of all members of the White Bear Band, specifically provided for immediate loss of the right to vote and to hold office in the White Bear Band for those who elected before the deadline of December 21, 1990 to join the Ocean Man Band.)"], ["[19]", "The result is that the rules for the composition and election of a government for the Ocean Man Band fell to be governed by custom. Section 2 of the", "Indian Act", "merely defined \"council of a band\" as follows:", "\"'council of the band' means", "(a) in the case of a band to which s. 74 applies, the council established pursuant to that section,", "(b) in the case of a band to which s. 74 does not apply, the council chosen according to the custom of the band, or, where there is no council, the chief of the band chosen according to the custom of the band ...\"", "The", "Indian Act", "provides no guidance as to how that custom is to be identified. The Department of Indian and Northern Affairs has left this matter to be determined internally by the band. In the Settlement Agreement to which Her Majesty was a party the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs was committed to establishing the Ocean Man Band if requested to do so \"by members of the White Bear Band who are descendants of members of the ... Ocean Man Band[s] ...\" As the Minister subsequently, on August 23, 1990 re-established the band at the request of the Ocean Man Negotiating Committee he obviously accepted the Committee as representing the descendants of members of that band as it existed up until 1901. Further, in a letter of June 21, 1990 from an official of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs to the solicitor for the Ocean Man Negotiating Committee, it was indicated that the department was not required and did not wish to become involved in \"vetting the original election procedures for newly constituted bands\" which in effect the department obviously considered this to be. In her affidavit the plaintiff Aletha Sunkawasti confirms that the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs has declined to intervene in an \"internal matter\"."], ["[20]", "Unless otherwise defined in respect of a particular band, \"custom\" must I think include practices for the choice of a council which are generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus. With a newly re-established band whose circumstances are vastly different (e.g. the majority not being resident on the reserve) from those of the band dissolved some 90 years earlier, it is not surprising that innovative measures would have to be taken to establish a contemporary \"custom\". The real question as to the validity of the new constitution then seems to be one of political, not legal, legitimacy: is the constitution based on a majority consensus of those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the band? This is a question which a court should not seek to answer in the absence of some discernable legal criteria which it can apply. While there might be some other basis for judicial supervision if there were clear evidence of fraud or other acts on the part of the defendants which could clearly not be authorized by the", "Indian Act", ", there is no evidence of any such activities before me."], ["[21]", "The strongest arguments which the plaintiffs make are: that the constitution was not adopted by referendum or general meeting of the band but by individual approval or disapproval in writing; that many of those voting for the constitution were not properly members of the Ocean Man Band; and that some of the defendants were disqualified by the very terms of the constitution from standing as candidates for election as band councillors. On the first point, there is as I have said no clear legal requirement that a constitution for a newly reconstituted band, not the subject of an order under s. 74(1), must be adopted by referendum or general meeting of the band. With respect to the alleged disqualification of many of those voting for the constitution, the plaintiffs really provide no satisfactory evidence or analysis as to why, in their view, so many electors were disqualified. It is true that there are some ambiguities in the documents, particularly in s. 5 of the", "Band Membership Code", "that \"no member of the Ocean Man Band may be a member of any other band\". But this must be read in association with s. 1 of the same", "Code", "which says that the first Ocean Man Band list is to be comprised of those members of the White Bear Band who have chosen to join the Ocean Man Band. The fact that the names of many of those electing to join Ocean Man Band still remained on the White Bear Band list was, as I indicated earlier, only an administrative and transitional phenomenon which it appears to me must have been contemplated when the Internal Settlement Agreement and the", "Band Membership Code", "were drafted and approved. With respect to the third ground, the alleged disqualification of the defendants as councillors, the plaintiffs rely on para. 4(b) of part I of the constitution dealing with \"The Band Council\" where it is provided that no person may be a candidate or hold office as Chief or councillor if he is an \"elected official\" of the Ocean Man Trust or any band-related corporation. At the time of the band council election four of the defendants who ran and were elected were already trustees of the Ocean Man Trust and directors of a band-related corporation, Ocean Man Developments Ltd. Sometime after the election the defendants who are members of the band council ceased to be officers of either the trust or the corporation. There is a very debatable issue of fact and law as to whether the defendants who ran for council and who now hold office were disqualified within the meaning of the constitution which precludes a candidate or councillor from being \"an elected official\" of the trust or of a band-related corporation. None of them were elected to the founding boards of the trust or the corporation and since the election of the band council proper elections have been held of both the trustees and the directors of the corporation."], ["[22]", "It is possible that on the trial of this matter the plaintiffs may be able to make out the merits of their case. But they have not done so in the present proceedings. There are serious deficiencies with the affidavit evidence produced, particularly that of the plaintiff Joy Mann-Sheepskin. In places her affidavit reads more like a pleading of facts than the attestation of evidence of a witness to matters within her personal knowledge. It should be kept in mind that the remedy of quo warranto being sought here must be sought by originating notice and not by an interlocutory application. Therefore the evidence in support of it must be based on the personal knowledge of the deponent and not on information and belief. In places the affidavit of Ms. Mann-Sheepskin states facts which cannot possibly within her personal knowledge and she does not even state the source of her information. Further, if the plaintiffs expect this court to set aside the constitution because it was approved by persons not members of the Ocean Man Band they must be prepared to show by evidence, individual by individual, that such persons were not members of the band at the time they approved the constitution or else demonstrate why the lists which they have produced are conclusive of the matter.", "Quo Warranto"], ["[23]", "It will be apparent from the foregoing that I do not consider that the plaintiffs have adequately established on the evidence and the law that the defendants are without lawful authority to act as band councillors. Therefore there is no basis on the merits for issuing quo warranto."], ["[24]", "In any event I would refuse to issue quo warranto in these circumstances because the plaintiffs all acquiesced by participating in the holding of the band council election, and also three of them have taken part in the election for trustees of the Ocean Man Trust, both held pursuant to the constitution they now impugn. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that if the plaintiffs Peter Bigstone and Aletha Sunkawasti had been successful as candidates for council and if the candidates supported by Joy Mann-Sheepskin and Robert Sunkawasti had been successful in that election, no action would have been brought either in the Court of Queen's Bench of Saskatchewan or in this court.", "Summary Judgment"], ["[25]", "The plaintiffs seek summary judgment at this stage pursuant to rule 341(b) which allows such an application at any stage of a proceeding \"in respect of which the only evidence consists of documents ...\" Again, it will be apparent from the foregoing that I do not consider the documents conclusive of the matter. For example, I have been unable to find legal criteria which makes the constitution intrinsically invalid nor can it be concluded without more that the defendants were disqualified to serve as candidates or councillors by the terms of the constitution. Further, the documents do not in my view by themselves establish that sufficient of the electors were disqualified so as to make the constitution legally irrelevant to the Ocean Man Band.", "Interlocutory Injunction"], ["[26]", "Applying the usual tests, I accept that the plaintiffs have raised a serious issue and have thus met the threshold requirement for an injunction pending trial."], ["[27]", "They have not, however, demonstrated that irreparable harm will come to them and that this harm would exceed that which would flow from the grant of an injunction. Apart from expressions of concern that, in their view, the defendant band councillors are acting without authority, the plaintiffs' evidence of actual harm to them or to the band is very sparse indeed. In the 33 paragraph affidavit of the plaintiff Joy Mann-Sheepskin only one paragraph seeks to describe such harm, as follows:", "\"28. Mismanagement of Ocean Man Band and the resources of Ocean Man Band has been the hallmark of the present band council. By and large the Ocean Man Band council has been managing band affairs for its own benefit and is seeking to purchase property in British Columbia rather than restoring to the band its original lands. A copy of a lease executed May 13, 1991 by Laura Big Eagle and Doug Big Eagle in their alleged capacity as Chief and council is attached hereto as Exhibit 'M'.\"", "It will be noted that the first sentence is extremely vague and general as is the first part of the second sentence. No specific information or documentation is provided with respect to the alleged attempts to purchase property in British Columbia. (There is, on the other hand, considerable evidence provided by the defendants as to the efforts being made by the council to restore the band to lands in Saskatchewan.) The reference to the lease executed on May 13, 1991 does not demonstrate any apparent harm to the band and in fact that lease has already expired so no more harm can possibly arise from it. In her affidavit the plaintiff Aletha Sunkawasti states that she has been advised by the contractors hired to construct houses for the band that the house which she and her husband occupy will be torn down. This suggests at least the possibility of some immediate harm to this plaintiff. In her affidavit the defendant Chief Laura Big Eagle denies that there was ever any intention of tearing down this house and her counsel assured me that the defendants were prepared to give an undertaking that the house would not be torn down pending trial."], ["[28]", "The plaintiff Aletha Sunkawasti in her affidavit also makes general allegations about mismanagement of funds and resources:", "\"8. The defendants have mismanaged band funds and band resources while they purported to act as interim band council and while they have purported to act as band council of Ocean Man Band. Ocean Man Band has received funds from INAC and White Beatr/Pheasant's Rump/Ocean Man Trust. A copy of the qualified auditor's report prepared by Louis Tapper dated July 31, 1991 for the period ending March 31, 1991 attached hereto as Exhibit 'B' indicates the INAC revenues and expenditures that have been made by the group purporting to act as Ocean Man Band council and the group that purported to act as the Ocean Man Band council. I am advised by my lawyer, James Nugent, that James Nugent spoke to Louis Tapper and advised James Nugent that the report covers a period of time from approximately November 1990 to March 31, 1991.\"", "Again the allegations are vague and they are to my mind substantially if not completely refuted in the details provided in the affidavit of Chief Laura Big Eagle. The auditor's report referred to does not on its face disclose to me any mismanagement."], ["[29]", "Thus the plaintiffs have not made any compelling case for irreparable harm either to themselves or to the band at large should the defendant band councillors continue in office. On the other hand, the evidence demonstrates that substantial harm could ensue to members of the band generally if the band council were suddenly to be removed from office or enjoined from acting. The most salient fact here is that the Internal Settlement Agreement, approved by referendum by the White Bear Band, provides for a three year transition period during which members of the White Bear Band who elected to become members of the Ocean Man Band could remain on the White Bear Reserve. This three year period expires in September 1992. In light of this the defendant members of council have taken a number of steps to provide for housing for members of the band on land newly established as its reserve. To this end the council has entered into contracts for the construction of houses. If the defendant council were now precluded from acting it could bring into question the validity of these contracts and certainly the continuing work to be done under them. The enjoining of the defendant band councillors and their replacement by a receiver manager appointed by the court, as sought by the plaintiffs, would be very disruptive at this stage. While it cannot be determinative of the matter, it is also an important consideration for me that the plaintiffs have frankly said that they could not provide any undertaking to pay damages in the event an injunction were issued and later set aside."], ["[30]", "Turning to the balance of convenience, I believe that considerations described by the Supreme Court of Canada in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Man.R.(2d) 241; 18 C.P.C.(2d) 273; 38 D.L.R.(4th) 321, are pertinent here: namely that in considering the possible inconvenience to a public authority that might be caused by an injunction, it is necessary to consider the convenience of the public which that authority serves. On the basis of the evidence before me, the inconvenience to the members of the band generally which would be caused by such an injunction would far outweigh any harm to the plaintiffs for which they have provided any credible evidence."], ["[31]", "Normally in deciding whether to grant an interlocutory injunction, the court should not consider the merits further unless other factors are almost balanced and the merits are predominantly in favour of one party or the other. In my view considerations of irreparable harm and the balance of convenience substantially favour the defendants in this case. From what I have said earlier, I also believe that on the basis of the evidence and argument before me the plaintiffs' case is not strong on the merits."], ["[32]", "Taking all these factors into account, I am dismissing the application for an interlocutory injunction.", "Appointment Of A", "Receiver-Manager"], ["[33]", "As there is no basis for me suspending the defendants from their functions as band councillors, there is no basis upon which I could and should appoint a receiver-manager. The evidence is certainly not sufficient to show that such a drastic step would be appropriate.", "Disposition"], ["[34]", "I am therefore going to dismiss the application of the plaintiffs for the various remedies described in the notice of motion. As the only specific harm threatened to any of the plaintiffs is that described by Aletha Sunkawasti as to the possibility of their house being torn down (a possibility which was far from proved to my satisfaction) and as the defendants have willingly agreed to undertake that such should not be done prior to trial, I will make that the one condition of dismissal of the application."], ["[35]", "I am not awarding any costs because, for reasons expressed above, I believe that this dispute would not have arisen if the Ocean Man Band Negotiating Committee, including all of the defendants except Daniel Bigstone, had ensured that by the wording of the Internal Settlement Agreement, before it was submitted for approval by referendum, a clear authority was given to the Negotiating Committee to act as an interim band council to prepare the constitution and organize the first election, and if they had better designed and implemented the transitional provisions of the constitution for that election. It is these deficiencies that have given some plausibility to this challenge to the legitimacy of the present band council.", "Application dismissed.", "Editor: Gary W.

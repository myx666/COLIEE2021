The Applicant's brother was also beaten. The police arrived, but rather than intervene they accused the Applicant of insulting the Turkish nation and flag, and having links to the PKK.

The RPD noted that letters of support or documents outlining the Applicant's political involvement could have easily been provided (RPD Decision at para 13).", "b) The Applicant failed to demonstrate persecution by the Turkish authorities based upon their suspicion that he had connections with the PKK. In particular, the RPD noted that the Turkish authorities released the Applicant from detention after satisfying themselves that he was not a PKK supporter; the Applicant obtained a passport in December, 2011, the same year of his alleged detentions by the Turkish authorities; and the Applicant was able to withstand scrutiny during airport security screenings upon departure from Turkey. The RPD concluded that the Applicant is not now suspected of being a PKK supporter.", "c) The Applicant failed to demonstrate that he was persecuted due to his membership in the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP). The RPD accepted that the Applicant was a member of the BDP and recognized past incidents of state-sanctioned violence against BDP members. However, the RPD found that membership in the BDP was not, in and of itself, sufficient to sustain a finding of persecution or risk.", "d) A letter dated January 18, 2014 from the Chairman of the BDP, which stated only that the Applicant was a permanent party member, had little probative value.

Moreover, the letter did not mention that the Applicant was arrested or detained in 2011 on account of his political opinion.", "e) Four of the alleged detentions in 2011 and the beatings and torture inflicted upon the Applicant by Turkish authorities were not supported by the evidence, and the Applicant failed to provide sufficient and trustworthy evidence to establish that he was injured while he was detained in Turkey. The Applicant did not seek or require medical attention following his alleged beatings in 2011.", "f) The medical report of Dr. Hirsz dated September 16, 2013 was inconclusive and lacked detail.

As mentioned above, enforcement action was one of the compliance actions that could be taken by the Agency to rectify any deficiencies identified on the basis of the responses received."], ["[32]", "At best, the November 3, 2009 letter can be described as ambiguous, as conceded by counsel for the Respondent. However, when read in the broader context of the February 11 and May 12, 2010 letters, the picture that emerges is clearer: nowhere do we find in these letters a clear and unequivocal statement indicating that if an FRFI's information boxes are found to be non-compliant, the FRFI will be contacted by the Agency and given an opportunity to correct any problem before a Notice of Violation is issued. The fact that Mega's representatives may have thought they would be contacted before a Notice of Violation was issued, is not sufficient for a legitimate expectation to arise. As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :", "For the doctrine to operate, the agency's conduct in the exercise of its discretion \"including established practices, conduct or representations that can be characterized as clear, unambiguous and unqualified\" must have induced in the complainant a reasonable expectation that it will retain a benefit or be consulted before a contrary decision is taken: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 131."], ["[33]", "Moreover, the duty of fairness is flexible and depends on an appreciation of the context of the particular statute and the rights affected. As such, several factors are relevant to determining the content of the duty of fairness, of which the legitimate expectations of the individual or corporation challenging the decision is only one among others. Of equal importance will be the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it, the nature of the statutory scheme and the terms of the statute pursuant to which the body operates, the importance of the decision to the individual or individuals affected, and the choices of procedure made by the agency itself (", "Baker", ", above at paras 21ff)."], ["[34]", "The Appellant made much of the fact that the Agency's decision had the potential to negatively impact its reputation. Counsel contended that the stigma of violating a government statute is more damaging than a finding of liability as against an opposing party in an adversarial dispute."], ["[35]", "While corporations no doubt face potential economic consequences as a result of a regulatory board decision, and may even lose goodwill associated with their name, these consequences are not on a par with the impact a decision may have on the reputation of an individual and its attendant consequences, both in terms of dignity and livelihood. In that respect, it is quite telling that the Supreme Court only referred to the importance of the decision to the individual or individuals affected in", "Baker", ". As a result, I agree with the Respondent that corporations are not entitled to the same level of procedural fairness as individuals, and that tribunals charged with regulating economic activity are not held to the same standards as tribunals dealing with personal individual rights (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[36]", "Moreover, the Commissioner indicated in her decision that she did not intend to make her decision public, despite s. 31 of the", "Act", "permitting it. The fact that the Appellant violated the", "Regulations", "would therefore not have been known, had it not been for the fact that it decided to bring this appeal. It may therefore be said that, to some extent, any damage to the Appellant's reputation was self-inflicted."], ["[37]", "As for the nature of the decision and the process followed, the Appellant argues in favour of a high duty of fairness because the decision of the Commissioner is final and the monetary penalty is akin to a criminal fine. On the other hand, the Respondent submits that the Agency operates in an administrative manner which warrants a \"less content-rich\" level of procedural fairness."], ["[38]", "Even though the Commissioner's decision is final, the Appellant omits the fact that the Deputy Commissioner initially issued a Notice of Violation and granted the Appellant the opportunity to submit representations with respect to the violation, before the Commissioner issued her final decision. The Notice of Violation is not the equivalent of a finding of violation. In response to that Notice of Violation, the Appellant provided a detailed, 6-page submission to the Commissioner. The process followed by the Commissioner was consistent with sections 22 and 23 of the", "Act", ", and ensured that the Appellant knew the case it had to meet and had a full opportunity to respond to that case."], ["[39]", "I also agree with the Respondent that the process before the Commissioner does not resemble a court proceeding and is more akin to a regulatory/administrative process. The", "Act", "does not provide for or contemplate the filing of evidence, cross-examinations or oral hearings. The Commissioner is an expert tribunal, with the mandate to regulate a narrow sphere of economic activity. The Agency is not court-like in form or substance."], ["[40]", "Finally, I disagree with the Appellant's argument that an administrative penalty is necessarily similar to a criminal fine. This argument is not supported by case law. In order to determine if an administrative penalty amounts, in reality, to a penal sanction, one must review the objective of the Act, the purpose of the sanction and the process leading to the imposition of the sanction (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In my opinion, the nature of the administrative process is,", "prima facie,", "for the protection of the public in accordance with Parliament's policy decision (", "R v Wigglesworth", ", [1987] 2 SCR 541 at p 560). The Appellant has not submitted any evidence or presented any argument to the contrary.", "c)", "Did the Commissioner err in concluding that the Appellant's information boxes violated the", "Regulations"], ["[41]", "The Appellant does not argue that its boxes contain all of the information contemplated by Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of the", "Regulations", ", or that the format of its boxes is the same as the format of the boxes set out in the Schedules. Rather, the Appellant takes issue with the Commissioner's interpretation of the", "Regulations", ", arguing that they provide FRFIs with discretion to decide on the formatting and content of their boxes."], ["[42]", "The Appellant argues that it adopted an interpretation of the regulatory scheme which was plausible on a plain reading of the text. It interpreted \"the\" in paragraph 6(2.1)(b) and 6(2.2)(b) of the", "Regulations", "as relating to \"applicable\" rather than to \"information box\". It also submitted that the language of paragraph 6(2.4) allows some discretion in the format of the information boxes as the specific format of the boxes provided in the Schedule were not mandatory. Finally, Mega relied on the Agency's October 2nd Notification, wherein the Agency provided what it stated were \"examples of information boxes\" which contained \"generic illustrations of how the information boxes could appear ... and what content should be included\"; this would suggest that the information boxes were not prescribed, as the language is permissive rather than mandatory."], ["[43]", "While attractive, these arguments cannot be sustained. I am unable to agree with Mega that the language of the", "Regulations", "is permissive or discretionary. Quite to the contrary, s. 6(1) states that banks granting credit \"must\" provide borrowers with disclosure statements which include an \"information box\" setting out certain key information. Schedules 1 through 5 then go on to set out in precise detail, the form and content the information boxes must have with respect to five types of credit agreements. Contrary to the permissive language used elsewhere in the", "Regulations", ", there is nothing permissive in s. 6(2.1)(b) and 6(2.2)(b), according to which an FRFI's information boxes \"as set out in one of Schedules 1 to 5, containing the information referred to in that Schedule, must be presented at the beginning of the agreement or application\". By way of example, this is to be contrasted with the use of the word \"may\", in paragraphs 6(2) and 6(3)."], ["[44]", "The Schedules themselves are highly detailed and prescribed a particular form with specific information and terms. This would suggest that banks cannot pick and choose what information will be provided. The", "Regulations", "go as far as specifying the font sizes, spacing, margins, etc. that must be used in the information boxes (s. 6(2.4)), and is a further indication that banks are expected to adhere to a prescribed protocol in order to ensure uniformity of presentation."], ["[45]", "I agree with the Respondent that this reading of the", "Regulations", "is also consistent with the scheme of the regulatory regime that the Agency administers; one of the primary purposes being to ensure that consumers have the best information possible to allow them to make informed product choices. In the event that banks were allowed to use their own languages or even to order the boxes in a different way, consumers would be left with a much more complicated task when comparing costs of borrowing at different types of financial institutions. Accordingly, I find that a strict reading of the", "Regulations", "is more consistent with the overriding purpose of the", "Act", "and the", "Regulations"], ["[46]", "It is true that the October 2, 2009 letter from the Agency to FRFIs, suggests a certain degree of discretion in implementing the new", "Regulations", ". However, the language of that letter cannot supersede the legally-binding, unequivocal and mandatory nature of the", "Regulations", ". If Mega had any doubt as to what was required, it could easily have picked up the phone and requested information from the Agency. It was clearly neither prudent nor reasonable to rely on the ambiguous language of a single letter instead of complying with the clear stipulations of the", "Regulations"], ["[47]", "Having found that the Commissioner's interpretation of the", "Regulations", "was reasonable and, I dare say, correct, it is clear and undisputed that the Appellant's information boxes failed to comply with the", "Regulations", "in a number of ways. As found by the Commissioner, the Appellant's information boxes omitted much of the information required by Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of the", "Regulations", "; did not have the prescribed left-hand column as set out in Schedules 1, 2 and 3; and included extra rows, re-ordered rows and employed terminology that was different than that set out in the relevant schedules.", "d) Did the Commissioner err in failing to properly apply the defence of justification or excuse?"], ["[48]", "Relying on section 28(2) of the", "Act", ", which preserves the common law principles of justification and excuse as defences to alleged violations, the Appellant initially submitted in its written representations, that it meets the two-fold test of that defence, as developed in", "R v Sault Ste.

This is clearly the correct approach to take. Ignorance of the law cannot be an excuse. Counsel for the Respondent aptly drew the Court's attention in that respect to the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in", "Corporation de l'École  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 689 [", "École Polytechnique", "], where Justices Létourneau and Décary (for a unanimous Court) stated:", "This brief review of the legislation and case law leads to the following conclusion. Apart from exceptions, mistakes in good faith and reasonable mistakes of law as to the existence and interpretation of legislation are not recognized as defences to criminal offences, nor to strict liability offences or prosecutions governed by the rules applicable in strict liability.", "e) Did the Commissioner err by failing to properly apply the defence of due diligence?"], ["[50]", "Counsel for the Appellant argued that Mega exercised due diligence, which is a defence pursuant to s. 28(1) of the", "Act", ". It is claimed that the Chief Compliance Officer notified senior management and functional management at its four Canadian branches of the new requirements, that it modified its existing information boxes and agreements, and that all four Canadian branches reviewed the revised documents. The Appellant also developed and executed an implementation plan within the implementation start date of January 1, 2010, and participated in all monitoring activities required by the Agency. Finally, the Appellant translated and modified some wording in its new documents to ensure adequate translation in Chinese, the language of its clients."], ["[51]", "Unfortunately for the Appellant, these steps fall far short of demonstrating due diligence. This defence was articulated in", "Sault Ste. Marie", ", above at pp 1325-6 and will be available if it can be established that all reasonable steps to avoid a particular event have been taken. Various courts have noted that it is a heavy burden to meet (see, for ex.,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 67). In particular, it will not be sufficient to plead that an error has been made in good faith or that a party had no intention to infringe a statute (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4th) 311;", "École  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 29). Similarly, the evidence presented to support this defence must relate to the specific offence at issue, and cannot merely establish that the party was generally acting lawfully. As the Ontario Court of Appeal stated in", "R v Raham", ", 2010 ONCA 206 at para 48, 99 OR (3d) 241:", "The due diligence defence relates to the doing of the prohibited act with which the defendant is charged and not to the defendant's conduct in a larger sense. The defendant must show he took reasonable steps to avoid committing the offence charged, not that he or she was acting lawfully in a broader sense."], ["[52]", "In the present case, the Commissioner could reasonably conclude that not all reasonable steps have been taken to avoid the violation of the", "Regulations", ". The Appellant had a number of months within which to make the necessary amendments. However, the steps taken by the Appellant to comply with the new", "Regulations", "raise more questions than the Appellant cared to provide. The only steps identified by the Appellant were a review of the revisions to the Appellant's information boxes by senior management and functional managers in the Appellant's Toronto and Vancouver business units. In addition, a report to the Appellant's board of directors in mid-March 2010, some two and a half months after the", "Regulations", "came into force, simply confirmed the Appellant's belief that its information boxes were compliant."], ["[53]", "These steps do not provide many specifics as to what exactly the Appellant did, who did it, what expertise the Chief Compliance Officer and the senior management had in addressing and implementing the", "Regulations", ", on what basis they reached the view that the information boxes complied with the requirements of the", "Regulations", ", why they did not seek the Agency's input to ensure compliance when amending its information boxes, etc. This is a far cry from what a defence of due diligence requires. It substantiates the Appellant's claim that it made a good faith effort to comply with the information box requirements and had no intention of violating the", "Regulations", ", as found by the Commissioner.

There was no need to do so once negligence had been established, since negligence amounts to a lack of due diligence.

Such a prerequisite imposes an unduly heavy burden on the Agency, fails to recognize that harm in this context is hard to measure, and does not take into account that regulatory measures of this kind, are aimed at fostering the public good and a more leveled playing ground for customers of powerful financial institutions. It is indeed significant that the relevant provisions of the", "Regulations", "do not list actual harm to consumers as an element of the offence.

She also came to the conclusion that Mega has had no violations, they made a good faith effort to comply with the information box requirements and it was not their intention to be non-compliant.

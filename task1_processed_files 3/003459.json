The female applicant also based her claim on her membership in a politically active family."], ["[2]", "The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected the applicants' refugee claim, finding that they had not provided credible evidence that the male applicant was in the DRC during the period of his alleged persecution. As a result, the Board found that he was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. Having based her claim on that of her husband, the Board said, the claim of the female applicant must also fail."], ["[3]", "The applicants now seek to have the Board's decision set aside, asserting that the Board's credibility findings relating to the male applicant were unreasonable, and were reached in a manner that was unfair.

In the case of the male applicant, he says that he joined the party in March of 1995, and, upon his return to the DRC in 1998, became a national secretary of the party. In addition to being a member of the PDSC in her own right, the female applicant also claims to come from a politically active family."], ["[6]", "The male applicant says that upon his return to the DRC, he went to work for the AJMB@ business as a technical director. This employer had a contract with the Congolese armed forces.

The Board found the plane tickets to be highly suspect, as the name of the passenger had been erased. The \"frontispice\" of the ticket was in the name of \"MAWAKA/AIME\".

Having reviewed the transcript, the documentary record and the male applicant's PIF, I am satisfied that the Board's credibility findings are more than reasonable. Further, in all of the circumstances, I am not persuaded that there was any obligation on the presiding member to raise his concerns about the documents with the applicants at the hearing."], ["[20]", "With respect to the failure to mark the \"frontispice\" of the ticket as an exhibit at the hearing, while I am satisfied that this was an error on the part of the Board, I am not persuaded that this error justifies the decision of the Board being set aside as it relates to the male applicant. In this regard, the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is distinguishable, as the document in issue in that case was the applicant's PIF, which was required by law to be filed at a refugee hearing. In this case, it is clear that the evidence of the male applicant was rife with inconsistencies and implausibilities.

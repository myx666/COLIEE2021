It seems to me, as I said earlier, that the order calls for cooperation of everyone, requiring of all the interested parties and not only Mr. Genest that certain things be done or that certain omissions occur. And in the context in which the communication of the parties has not been restored, it is very hard to determine who is primarily responsible, who is more responsible than another.

It owns two reserves, namely the Whitworth reserve on the south shore of the Saint-Laurent, 30 kilometres south of Rivière-du-Loup, and the Cacouna reserve, which is located near the municipality of the same name. According to the Indian Register held at the DINAC pursuant to the", "Indian Act", ", a single person resided on the reserve (affidavit of Daniel Tétreault, paragraph 13)."], ["[19]", "This Band, as well as its Band Council, is considered to be federal boards, commissions or other tribunals within the meaning of section 2 of the", "Federal Courts Act", "(R.S.C. 1985, c.

Yet, it appears that since 1987, the PNMV has been administered and represented by its elected Band Council and governed in accordance with the customs of this First Nation, unlike bands that hold their elections and that are governed by the rules of the", "Indian Act", ". In fact, it could not be any other way because the members of the PNMV do not occupy a given territory or reserve, an essential requirement for sections 74 et seq. of the", "Indian Act", "to apply. That is why on November 17, 1987, the Minister adopted an order-in-council to clarify the situation, so that the band could choose its council in accordance with its custom."], ["[21]", "The only custom that appears to be recognized by the band regarding the functioning of the Band Council, its powers, duties and functions, as well as the powers of the Grand Chief, is codified in its general by-law. However, the parties do not agree with respect to the issue of whether the by-law currently in effect is the one that was adopted in 1991, or the more recent by-law adopted in 2003. I will return to this issue in my analysis."], ["[22]", "With respect to the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, it does not intervene in the Band Council's elections, does not control the validity of resolutions adopted by the Band Council pursuant to the Band's general by-laws, and does not interfere in the conflicts that may arise within the Band Council, insofar as the PNMV is not governed by the", "Indian Act", "in electoral matters and with regard to its internal governance.

The nature of the powers exercised and the relationship that elected councillors have with the members of the Band in fact make the Band Council a decentralized entity at public law very similar to municipal councils.

This approach is illustrated in the following excerpt from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited in the preceding paragraph:", "\"The", "Act", "[i.e. the", "Indian Act", "] is clearly of a tenor indicating the need and intent to benefit and protect the Indian bands and their individual members coming under its provisions. It is to be read, interpreted and applied in that light. Just as in the exercise of a power by a municipality is required to be exercised in strict accord with the statute, to protect the interests of the inhabitants, so, it seems to me, and on the same principle, the council's powers under the", "Indian Act", "are to be exercised strictly in accord with the", "Act", "in the interests of the benefit and protection of the Indians.\""], ["[27]", "This classical approach seems nevertheless to be severely compromised by the pragmatic and functional approach on which a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada now appear to rely in determining the appropriate standard of review not only for decisions made by administrative entities but also for the resolutions adopted by local authorities. This is what is indicated in the evolution of the case law that we can note on reviewing the following decisions by the Supreme Court of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Professor Suzanne Comtois, in her book entitled", "Vers la primauté de l'approche pragmatique et fonctionnelle", "(Éd. Yvon Blais, Cowansville, 2003, at pages 107 to 125), incidentally, carries out a thorough and very enlightening analysis of this."], ["[28]", "In this case, I do not believe that the pragmatic and functional method can dictate a standard of review other than the one resulting from the ultra vires application. First, I note that the", "Indian Act", "does not protect decisions made by a band council, and even less so those made by a Grand Chief through a privative clause. Second, I do not believe that the Grand Chief is in a better position than our Court to determine whether the general by-laws authorize him to act as he did. It is true that the Grand Chief had to assess the prevailing situation to attempt to make the decision that would be in the best interest of the Band; on that point, the Court must show considerable deference. But the question submitted to us is not so much whether he was correct to act as he did, but whether he had the power to do so. In that respect, his expertise is certainly not any broader than that of the Court. The third factor of the pragmatic and functional analysis, i.e. Parliament's objective in entrusting the governance of the band council, is of particular importance. Parliament wanted to extend to the authority elected by the band members great autonomy in conducting its affairs and that objective must certainly involve a respectful attitude on the part of the courts. Also, the decisions made must fall within the parameters set by law; like the municipal councils, that is what ensures that the members' wishes will be respected and that their best interests will be taken into consideration. Finally, the issue of whether the decisions like those in dispute fall under the authority of the Grand Chief pursuant to the general by-laws is undeniably a question of law. Considering those four factors, I therefore determine that these decisions must be weighed according to the standard of correctness. That is to say that the deference that I must demonstrate in reviewing that issue will be minimal."], ["[29]", "The standard of review thereby established, I must now address the decisions by the Grand Chief that are challenged in this application for judicial review. On the basis of the affidavits filed by each side, I do not doubt that the alleged acts were in fact committed. Further, the respondent himself does not deny that he committed those acts, and his counsel did not attempt to demonstrate as such.

Indeed, it is not necessary for me to do so, since the applicants' counsel admitted during his oral submissions that the general by-laws of 2003 should be interpreted as authorizing the Grand Chief to act in urgent situations, despite the lack of an express clause to that effect."], ["[37]", "Accordingly, the issue in short is whether the Grand Chief could claim that there was urgency for making the decisions that he is alleged to have made unilaterally. This was not established before me. At best, there was only an argument that he had no other alternative faced with the Council's systematic refusal to cooperate with him. In my opinion, a lack of cooperation as such cannot be likened to an urgency. This notion must arise from an unforeseen factual situation commanding immediate decisions and not from a deadlock resulting from deep political dissension. It cannot go on indefinitely, as may be the case in a situation where each of the parties (i.e., the Grand Chief, on the one hand, and the four councillors, on the other) stands their ground. Furthermore, urgency normally dictates that the decisions made in this context be ratified as quickly as possible by the competent authority to be legitimized, albeit ex post facto."], ["[38]", "I therefore determine that the application for judicial review must be allowed and that the unilateral decisions by the Grand Chief referred to in paragraph 6 of these reasons are of no force or effect since they have no basis in the", "Indian Act", "or in the custom of the Band as noted in its various by-laws."], ["[39]", "I am well aware of the fact that the impasse underlying this application for judicial review could continue until a new election is held, which ordinarily would not be until 2007.

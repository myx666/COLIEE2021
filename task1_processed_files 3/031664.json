There may be no certainty of success but the skilled person might nevertheless assess the prospects of success as being sufficient to warrant a trial. In some circumstances this may be sufficient to render an invention obvious. On the other hand, there are areas of technology such as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology which are heavily dependent on research, and where workers are faced with many possible avenues to explore but have little idea if any one of them will prove fruitful. Nevertheless they do pursue them in the hope that they will find new and useful products.

For example, it is well known in the art that excipients should not react with the active ingredient. Excipients, and particularly bulking agents, are pharmacologically inactive substances. Indeed, what is disclosed to have happened in the '146 Patent is something that a formulator would want to avoid, namely the interaction between the active agent and the bulking agent. In this regard, it is clear that a PSA would not expect the mannitol to react with and form an ester with bortezomib.

Although there is a general preference for ready-to-use injectable solutions, stability challenges may indicate that freeze-drying is the best option. Freeze-dried powders can usually be safely stored until they are reconstituted in solution for administration to a patient;", "d. Freeze-drying was a known dry state stabilization technique for peptides and proteins. Prior to 2001, most such compounds were prepared as freeze-dried powders. One prior art reference in support of this approach was Wang (1994) which said the following:", "Lyophilization of pharmaceuticals can yield high-quality products with an increased shelf life. Proteins or small drug molecules with stability problems are good candidates for lyophilization. Lyophilization is a process in which water is removed from formulations by sublimation at low temperatures under vacuum. The biological activity of proteins dried at low temperature is fairly well preserved and their shelf life prolonged in the dry state.", "e. Mannitol is one of the most commonly used excipients in freeze-dried formulations (of only a few) and would be considered for use as a matter of course. It was known to be well tolerated for injectable use. The known advantages for mannitol were described in Kim (1998) in the following terms;", "Mannitol is one of the most commonly used excipients in freeze-dried pharmaceutical products. One of the reasons for the widespread use of mannitol is its tendency to crystallize from frozen aqueous solutions and the high melting temperature of the mannitol/ice eutectic mixture (about - 1.5Â°C). This property promotes efficient freeze-drying and a physically stable, pharmaceutically elegant freeze-died solid."], ["[53]", "In comparing the state of the art as described above to the inventive concept of Claim 30 to ascertain the differences, Dr. Suryanarayanan found nothing inventive. He justified this view on the following basis:", "71. Wu 2000 disclosed that bortezomib had been formulated for parenteral administration but that the compound was found to be unstable in various aqueous solutions. In particular, Wu 2000 disclosed that bortezomib had been studied in various mixed aqueous solutions (PEG 300/ethanol/water; ethanol/saline; propylene glycol/ethanol/water), and that significant degradation was observed when bortezomib was stored in these solutions, for periods ranging from one day to eight months. Wu 2000 also disclosed at page 762 that bortezomib was unstable when stored in saline (containing 2% ethanol) for short periods of time: 96% drug remaining after 5 days, 94.1% drug remaining after 14 days (see Table 1).", "72. Knowing that bortezomib was a peptide drug formulated for parenteral administration and that it was unstable in solution, it would have been self-evident to the skilled formulator that freeze-drying would almost certainly improve the stability of bortezomib. As discussed above in relation to the common general knowledge, the skilled formulator would know that lyophilization is routinely used to resolve aqueous stability problems of parenteral formulations and that most peptide and protein drugs were prepared as freeze-dried powders to address stability issues, it would be obvious to the skilled formulator to follow this route and to prepare bortezomib in a lyophilized formulation.", "73. Also, as discussed above in relation to the common general knowledge, the skilled formulator would also know that a lyophilized formulation of bortezomib would require a bulking agent, and that mannitol would be the first choice, given its widely accepted use for this purpose.", "74. At paragraph 103 of his affidavit, Dr. Bodmeier states, with reference to Wu 2000, that degradation occurred fairly rapidly \"and most likely too rapidly for a liquid formulation to be possible.\" At paragraph 106, he states that a skilled formulator \"...would not have considered dissolving solid bortezomib in an aqueous medium, adding mannitol and then lyophilizing this solution based on the information provided in this Reference about the degradation, and particularly hydrolysis, of bortezomib in an aqueous medium\". I disagree.", "75. The key issue is the degradation kinetics, Table 1 of Wu 2000 (page 762) disclosed that 96% of intact bortezomib remained in normal saline solution (with 2% ethanol; pH 2.8) after 5 days at 25Â°C. This degradation rate would not deter a skilled team from using an aqueous medium for lyophilizing bortezomib. This rate of degradation is intolerable for long-term storage, but would be unlikely to pose any problem for the much shorter periods involved in the freeze-drying process and reconstitution. There would be no need to store bortezomib in an aqueous solution for extended periods at 25Â°C, either prior to lyophilizing it into a dried powder, or after it is reconstituted for use.", "76. In paragraph 107, Dr. Bodmeier argues that, based on Wu 2000, a skilled person would expect that lyophilized bortezomib would have lower storage stability than non-lyophilized solid bortezomib because of the higher water content in the lyophilized formulation. The problem disclosed in Wu 2000 is a lack of stability when formulated as an aqueous solution. Removal of the water by lyophilization is the obvious answer to this problem, and as discussed above in relation to the common general knowledge, is particularly suitable for drugs that may be susceptible to thermal degradation when dried under elevated temperatures.", "77. The issues relating to residual water content in mannitol containing formulations are well understood by the pharmaceutical community. The residual water content will be high only if a substantial fraction of the mannitol in the final lyophile is amorphous. Crystallization of mannitol can be brought about by annealing and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) can be used to develop an appropriate annealing protocol. Thus the formulator can take fairly simple and straightforward steps to completely crystallize the mannitol and minimize the water content in the final lyophilized cake. Therefore, there is simply no support for Dr. Bodmeier's suggestion that the amount of residual water in a lyophilized solid would dissuade a skilled formulator from pursuing a lyophilized formulation."], ["[54]", "Dr. Suryanarayanan then looked at the inventor's actual course of conduct in obtaining the results supporting Claim 30. A lyophilized mannitol formulation was quickly achieved and Dr. Suryanarayanan could identify no material difficulties in obtaining the desired stable formulation."], ["[55]", "Dr. Suryanarayanan also considered the suggestion by Dr. Valentino Stella that the formation of an ester was unexpected. He noted that the 146 Patent claims were not limited to esters of boronic acid compounds but, in any event, the skilled formulator would find it self-evident that the stability and shelf-life of bortezomib could be enhanced by freeze-drying. That would be the case whether or not an ester was formed."], ["[56]", "Dr. Suryanarayanan considered the prior art concerned with the potential for the formation of esters as reaction products from the combination of boronic acid compounds and polyols like mannitol. He drew from that material that the person of skill, whether it be a properly informed formulator or a medicinal chemist, would expect the reaction exemplified by Claim 30. He concluded this part of his analysis in the following way:", "95. As at 2001, bortezomib was a relatively new compound. The skilled formulator would not expect that the scientific, literature would include many references describing the compound, let alone pharmaceutical formulations containing the compound. Knowing this, the skilled formulator would in fact focus the search for useful information on references that describe the properties and formulations of closely related compounds. One of the first things that the skilled formulator would do when presented with the task of developing a more stable formulation of bortezomib would be to search the prior art references to learn how the most closely related compounds had been formulated in the past.", "96. The skilled team reading Wu 2000 would also observe that the authors cited and relied on information about other boronic acid compounds. Wu 2000 referred in the introduction to other boronic acid enzyme inhibitors, and the skilled person would be interested in any published formulation or stability information for related compounds.", "97. In paragraphs 150-152 of his affidavit, Dr. Bodmeier argues that the skilled person's search strategy would be to review the titles of the references cited in Wu 2000, but the skilled person would dismiss them as being of no interest, and as a result \"would not obtain any of these references\" and would \"just start working with the formulations\". I disagree. In my opinion, the skilled person would conduct a search for information about the chemistry and formulation properties of other boronic acid inhibitors and this would include the references cited in Wu 2000. The skilled person would not consider all of the cited references to be of no interest or help, as stated by Dr. Bodmeier.", "98. In paragraph 160 of his affidavit, Dr. Bodmeier argues that a skilled person would not find it self-evident that a lyophilized formulation of bortezomib would form a stable ester with mannitol that also readily reconstitutes and achieves a pharmaceutically active form when reconstituted. If one assumes that the skilled team was completely unaware that boronic acids would react with dihydroxy compounds when it carried out the project, there would be no reason not to lyophilize bortezomib with mannitol and there would be no reason to expect that the preparation would not be readily reconstituted.", "99. If one assumes that the skilled team knew or learned that boronic acids would react with dihydroxy compounds, this would not deter the skilled team form pursuing a lyophilized formulation. The skilled medicinal chemist on the formulation team would be expected to have an understanding of the reaction kinetics of ester formation and hydrolysis, and this understanding could be readily confirmed by simply dissolving the lyophilized preparation in water and analyzing for the active ingredient. Indeed, this is a common and routine test with any lyophilized formulation of a new compound.", "100. The skilled team would ultimately determine that an ester had formed between bortezomib and mannitol by conducting routine analysis of the lyophile (the freeze-dried product). The same mass spectral analysis that was reported at paragraph 141 of the 146 Patent to confirm the formation of the ester (by a strong signal at m/z = 531) was also conducted in Wu 2000 (method of analysis disclosed at page 759).", "VII.", "Dr. Bachovchin's Evidence"], ["[57]", "Dr. Bachovchin is a Professor of Developmental Molecular and Chemical Biology in the Department of Biochemistry at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, Massachusetts.

Nevertheless, under cross-examination he did express some views about the state of knowledge that a skilled formulator would be expected to bring the problem of finding a stable formulation for bortezomib. Dr. Bachovchin stated that the knowledge in the possession of the person of skill would include the following:", "a. Boronic acids tend not to be chemically stable compounds;", "b. The boronate moiety of boronic acid compounds was generally known to be chemically unstable;", "c.

He disagreed with Dr. Bodmeier's view that part of the inventive concept was the 'unexpected' reaction between boronic acid and mannitol. This was a reversible reaction that the person of skill would have expected and desired. That knowledge included the following:", "a. Bortezomib is a boronic acid peptide analog protease inhibitor that was known to be unstable in solution;", "b. Boronate esters form when boronic acids are combined with dihydroxy compounds and many of these will revert to free boronic acids when water is added;", "c. Boronate esters had been lyophilized.

It also disclosed that boronate esters of boronic acid compounds were preferred. It went on to explain how these esters could be formed with the use of hydroxyl compounds. This reference also disclosed the lyophilization of boronate ester compounds; and", "f. The person of skill would confidently predict that mannitol would form an ester with boronic acid and that bortezomib and its esters could be lyophilized.

Inasmuch as bortezomib was a relatively new chemical entity, the person of skill seeking to obtain a stable formulation would routinely consider chemical analogs to be a useful place to start. That prior art amply demonstrated that by combining an alkyl boronic acid (eg. bortezomib) with mannitol a reversible ester would form."], ["[68]", "On the basis of the prior art, Dr. Bachovchin concluded that it would have been obvious to the skilled team seeking to develop a stable formulation of bortezomib to lyophilize bortezomib with mannitol.

If Dr. Bodmeier's approach was to define the person of skill by considering Claim 30 in isolation, his evidence is of little value. I do not agree that individual patent claims can be construed independently from the rest of the claims or from the specification as a whole. The idea that individual claims may require interpretation by persons of skill with different sets of qualifications is unworkable. Patent law teaches that the person of skill may be a character of composite skills. It also teaches that a patent is to be read as a whole.

If a patentee obtains a workable formulation, the later discovery of one of its inherent characteristics does not add anything inventive to what had already been discovered: see", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED.

Each of these options presented some potential advantages and disadvantages but neither of them was counter-indicated. Given that bortezomib is a small molecule, it was a good candidate for lyophilization. The formulation also needed a bulking agent. Here there were a number of well-known choices. Mannitol was a commonly used bulking agent for freeze-dried formulations. Mannitol was also known to be a stabilizer. There were no apparent reasons to avoid mannitol or to think that it would not work in this application."], ["[112]", "In the end there is not much to distinguish Dr. Bodmeier's evidence from that of the Teva witnesses. The differences are mainly matters of emphasis. Considering the above-described problems with Dr. Bodmeier's evidence and the virtual absence of any meaningful impeachment of Dr. Suryanarayanan and Dr. Bachovchin, I accept their evidence where is differs from that of Dr. Bodmeier. In particular, I accept the following points of evidence:", "a. Bortezomib was known to be unstable in aqueous solutions and it was, therefore, a good candidate for dry state formulation either with lyophilization or as a dry powder;", "b. Lyophilization was a widely used and routine method to stabilize compounds that were unstable in aqueous solution. It was also a method that had been successfully used with bortezomib and with other similar small molecules;", "c. The person of skill would know that to formulate bortezomib a bulking agent was required. Mannitol was a bulking agent widely used in lyophilized formulations and the person of skill would consider it to be a likely choice for use with bortezomib;", "d. The person of skill would know from U.S. 454 and other prior art that mannitol was a polyol that could be used to make a boronate ester and that an ester would form when combined with bortezomib;", "e. The person of skill would expect that the mannitol ester of bortezomib would be readily reversible on reconstitution; and", "f. The person of skill would not be concerned about the formation of an ester because boronate esters were known to have a stabilizing effect and because they were preferred over boronic acids for use as synthetic intermediates."], ["[113]", "The choice of a routinely used stabilizing method and the selection of a routinely used bulking agent to formulate bortezomib cannot be said to be inventive. The fact that the formulator had a few choices to make and would need to test the formulation to ensure its efficacy does not render this exercise non-obvious. Here I adopt the point made by Justice Roger Hughes in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED, that the existence of number of possible routes to solve a problem does not mean that the route taken was not obvious. In", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, the same point was stated in the following way:", "\"First a route may still be an obvious one to try even if it is not possible to be sure that taking it will produce success, or sufficient success to make it commercially worthwhile. ... Secondly, if a particular route is an obvious one to take or try, it is not rendered any less obvious from a technical point of view merely because there are a number, and perhaps a large number, of other obvious routes as well. If a number of obvious routes exist it is more or less inevitable that a skilled worker will try some before others.\""], ["[114]", "The suggestion put forward by Dr. Bodmeier that a dry powder approach was another alternative to lyophilization is undoubtedly correct but it was never tried by Dr. Stella. When Dr. Stella proceeding with a dry state formulation, his immediate choice was lyophilization. That was precisely the approach that Dr. Suryanarayanan said would be the first choice of the person of skill. Dr. Stella's evidence that he elected to try a lyophilized powder so as not to be 'remiss' is a semantic characterization that is inconsistent with what took place. The same problem arises in connection with Dr. Stella's choice of mannitol. While it is true that other bulking agents might have been tried (and might well have worked), mannitol was one of only a few he tried. When asked about the motive to go with mannitol, Dr. Stella's answer did not suggest any particular insight. Mannitol was recommended to him by a colleague and he knew it to be a bulking agent \"used in a number of commercial freeze dried products\" [p 3017]. This is not the type of response that suggests that mannitol was an unlikely choice."], ["[115]", "There is no doubt that Dr. Stella faced some stability and solubility issues in his efforts to formulate bortezomib but much of that difficulty arose in connection with his initial attempts to obtain an injectable solution. At that point Dr. Stella was aware of the data reported in", "Wu", "and he knew that a liquid formulation would be difficult to obtain. Despite that knowledge he tested a number of different solvents for liquid formulation and although some showed promise, he was not confident that a liquid formulation would work [p 2990]. In October 1997 he decided to adopt an alternative freeze-dried strategy. His solubility problem effectively disappeared when he was told by his supervisor that the earlier solubility target could be significantly reduced. Once Dr. Stella went with lyophilization and chose mannitol as a bulking agent, he determined very quickly that the formulation went into solution appropriately and readily reconstituted. He described the reaction of the formulation team as \"a lot of whooping and hollering in the lab. We had discovered something that had not worked previously\". This was followed by routine long-term stability analysis that showed the compound to have good stability."], ["[116]", "It was only later that others did testing to characterize the compound and found that an ester had formed. Dr. Stella testified that, for him, this was unexpected and had he been aware of the reaction potential between mannitol and bortezomib, he would consider it to be a \"pre-negative\". Nevertheless, he conceded that excipients can sometimes enhance the efficacy of an API [p 3040]. He also testified that \"every excipient has its warts and one tries to anticipate those warts impinging your product negatively as much as possible\" [p 3041]."], ["[117]", "When Dr. Stella was fairly asked if there was anything unusually difficult or surprising about lyophilizing mannitol and bortezomib, he offered nothing specific. He answered only that a lot of work, thought and experience went into the exercise and he rather defensively characterized the question as \"trivializing\" those efforts [p 3031]."], ["[118]", "I would characterize the effort that went into the development of the compound described in Claim 30 as competent and detailed but, nevertheless, routine. There is nothing in the invention story offered by Dr. Stella that detracts from the fact that to obtain a workable formulation he applied a formulation technique known to provide stability to an unstable compound and used a well-known bulking agent. There was nothing teaching away from the approach he chose and there was no reason to believe that what was tried was unlikely to work. The fact that Dr. Stella continued to work in tandem on other options does not add anything inventive to the approach that ultimately proved to be successful."], ["[119]", "In my view, there are no material differences between what was known in the prior art and what is claimed in Claim 30. The person of skill would have had a fair expectation that, by lyophilizing bortezomib and mannitol, a successful, stable formulation would be the result. That is so whether or not the person of skill understood that an ester would form."], ["[120]", "It follows from all of the above that Claim 30 of the 146 Patent is invalid on the basis of obviousness and Janssen's application is dismissed.

The '426 patent does not mention, whether in the description or in the claim any clathrate or molecular complex of ethinylestradiol."], ["[95]", "In the portion of the Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) filed with the Minister by Apotex it describes the comparison products Jasminelle and YAZ, as containing ethinylestradiol and refers to them throughout by that name even though in a footnote below a table at section 3.2.P.2 it refers to the ethinylestradiol component of both products as \"stabilized by betadex as a clathrate (molecular inclusion complex).\""], ["[96]", "Therefore, I find, on the evidence of Jarosz including his cross-examination and including Apotex's (ANDS) that a clathrate of ethinylestradiol is not distinguished as such from the simpler term ethinylestradiol and that ethinylestradiol includes the clathrate. I note that Apotex, in making its allegations as to non-infringement, made no issue of the fact that its ethinylestradiol component was, in fact, a clathrate of that component."], ["[97]", "Given, therefore, the evidence which I find demonstrates that ethinylestradiol in the particulars of this case includes a clathrate of that compound, listing of the '426 patent was not improper.", "XIII.", "VALIDITY- ANTICIPATION"], ["[98]", "Apotex alleges that the claims at issue of the '426 patent are invalid because, more than one year before the filing date of the application for that patent, Bayer conducted certain clinical studies in Europe and the United States whereby what was claimed was both disclosed and enabled."], ["[99]", "I repeat part of Apotex's allegations in this respect:", "Apotex alleges that, during Phase II trials conducted from about January 1990 to September 1990 in Europe and Phase III trials conducted from about December 1992 to April 1996 in Europe and from about December 1996 to July 1998 in the United States, the patentee's oral contraceptive tablet was being publicly used by the participants enrolled in these trials.", "...", "There was no restriction imposed on participants that prevented them from disseminating information about the Bayer Tablets to the public.

In conclusion, it is my opinion that the clinical investigators, enrolled participants and potential participants would all have been aware of the following details of YASMIN:", "(a) that it was an oral contraceptive containing 3 mg of drospirenone and 0.03 mg of EE;", "(b) that it was in the form of a tablet;", "(c) that the tablets were contained within blister packs comprising 21 active pills and 7 placebo pills; and", "(d) that the intended use was for contraception.", "...", "57. Accordingly, in my opinion, there was no prohibition precluding the clinical investigators from disclosing information relating to YASMIN to the three groups mentioned above, and, no prohibition precluding the enrolled and potential participants from publicly sharing information about the details of YASMIN. Such information relating to YASMIN was known to the clinical investigators, participants and potential participants and was not intended to be confidential."], ["[104]", "Dr. Simon's opinion can be summarized with reference to paragraph 35 of his affidavit:", "35. Whatever extraordinary efforts are made on the part of the clinical investigator, in my experience, it will not ensure that all OC packets and tablets are returned and a great number of distributed tablets are never accounted for.

It has been acknowledged by the US court that not all of the unused study drugs were returned. Therefore, it appears that after having handed out the drugs the respondent effectively lost control over them as the participants in the clinical trials were in no way barred from disposing of the drugs as they wanted.", "In view of these circumstances, the board comes to the conclusion that the handing out of the drugs to the participants made them became publicly available."], ["[111]", "In the present Bayer argues that there is no evidence that any person connected with the clinical studies ever, in fact, received sufficient information so as to know exactly what the ingredients were in the tablets and there is no evidence that any person in fact analyzed any tablet or was likely to have done so.

I provided an edited version of what he wrote at pages 497 to 500 of the decision as reported where he set out eight (non-exhaustive) principles:", "1. Sale to the public or use by the public alone is insufficient to prove anticipation. Disclosure of the invention is required to constitute anticipation under para. 28.2(1)(a).", "2. For a prior sale or use to anticipate an invention, it must amount to \"enabling disclosure\".", "3. The prior sale or use of a chemical product will constitute enabling disclosure to the public if its composition can be discovered through analysis of the product.", "4. The analysis must be able to be performed by a person skilled in the art in accordance with known analytical techniques available at the relevant time.", "5. In the context of patent anticipation under para. 28.2(1)(a), when reverse engineering is necessary and capable of discovering the invention, an invention becomes available to the public if a product containing the invention is sold to any member of the public who is free to use it as she or he pleases.", "6. It is not necessary to demonstrate that a member of the public actually analyzed the product that was sold.", "7. The amount of time and work involved in conducting the analysis is not determinative of whether a skilled person could discover the invention. The relevant consideration, in this respect, is only whether inventive skill was required. There must be some evidence from which the use of inventive skill may be inferred. Complexity or time and work involved alone are insufficient.", "8. It is not necessary that the product that is the subject of the analysis be capable of exact reproduction. It is the subject matter of the patent claims (the invention) that must be disclosed through the analysis. Novelty of the claimed invention is destroyed if there is disclosure of an embodiment which falls within the claim."], ["[118]", "In applying these principles to the present case I find that there has been established a \"theoretical\" possibility that a tablet could have been kept and analyzed, therefore the requirements of subsection 28.2(1) (a) of the Patent Act have been met."], ["[119]", "However that does not end the matter. The law in Canada has long been established that experimental use in order to bring the invention to perfection, does not constitute public use e.g.", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  experimental use must be conducted in public."], ["[120]", "A practical application of the principle of experimental use can be seen with reference to the decision of this Court (Tremblay-Lamer J) in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aff'd 61 CPR(4th) 270 (FCA) where a farmer placed a feeder that he was experimenting with in the back of his farm where it could possibly have been seen by a delivery man.

The plaintiffs allege that it was built outside in the pads but that it was in a protected area that could not be seen by the public.", "Photographs taken of the property show that the feeder was indeed located in a protected area and that there was no practical vantage point on any raod from which the feeder could be seen clearly. The evidence showed that the only possible witness was the oil delivery man given the height of his delivery truck.

I do not accept this proposition. To test the device, Mr. Delichte had no alternative other than to use the cattle on his farm since they were part of his operation and had to be sold at one point. In cannot be said, in my view, that this amounts to a commercial use of his invention."], ["[121]", "In the present case clinical studies were necessary to prove that the drug was safe and effective and, thereby, gain government approval for sale. Until this had been demonstrated, no commercial sale of the drug could have been made. Bayer took reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of the relevant documents and to ensure that unused tablets were returned. The theoretical possibility that some tablets were retained and analyzed is just that, theoretical.

It must be noted that in raising those allegations that are different from each other Apotex and Cobalt seem more intent in casting about to pick at whether they can than to argue genuine ambiguities or insufficiencies.

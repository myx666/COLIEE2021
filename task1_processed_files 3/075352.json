The milky appearance arises from the formation of an o/w emulsion, namely large droplets of the oil being suspended in the vinegar. Such an emulsion, however, is not stable as the emulsion quickly settles back to the two original layers."], ["[44]", "Regular emulsions typically require energy to be added, such as mixing, to form the emulsion, though with the inclusion of surfactants, they can be self-emulsifying, as in the case of Novartis' Sandimmune® product. Emulsions appear opaque due to the relatively large droplet sizes. The droplet size of an emulsion is typically in the order of 4000 Å or more, but can range up to 10,000 Å or even larger. When the oil-in-water emulsion forms, the lipophilic component is distributed throughout the continuous aqueous phase."], ["[45]", "Emulsions (and emulsion preconcentrates) have been employed by formulators for many decades as an appropriate dosage form for lipid soluble drugs (such as cyclosporin).

Formulators have long known that the smaller the droplet size, the higher the surface area of contact between oil and water and the better the drug blood levels that result."], ["[47]", "To the foregoing end, the skilled formulator will make a product such that, when added to water, it will give the smallest possible particle size of the oil droplet containing the drug knowing that this will optimize drug movement into the gastrointestinal tissue and subsequently the blood stream.

As noted above, emulsions and microemulsions share some common characteristics, however microemulsions have some unique properties that regular or conventional emulsions do not possess. While there may be some disagreement as to whether microemulsions are a subset of emulsions or whether they are a distinct form, there is no disagreement that use of the term \"emulsion\" does not necessarily include a microemulsion."], ["[54]", "Indeed, the considerable differences between emulsions and microemulsions have been recognized by scientists who work in this area.

Then, in a case like the present, which does not involve a simple leap from the prior art to the invention (as in the James Watt type of case) but rather entails a journey with numerous steps taken in sequence, the court must ask itself by what routes it would have been possible to proceed to the goal from the starting point. Then, the court must see what obstacles the skilled man would have faced on these routes, and must enquire how he could have overcome them, either in the way that the inventor himself overcame the obstacles on his chosen route or by circumventing or overcoming them in some other way, or by choosing another route from the outset, or by abandoning one route and choosing another.'", "\"Having identified these various expedients, the court must finally ask whether they could have been overcome by pertinacity, sound technique or trial and error, with no more, or whether there would have been required a spark of imagination beyond the imagination properly attributable to the man skilled in the art.", "\"Equally, I am not persuaded that the standard of attainment contemplated by the sections will always be the same (although it will often be the same) for the individual members of the notional addressee team as for the notional discovery team. To work the patent, the addressees follow the instructions, filling in gaps and clarifying obscurities by common sense and trial and error. This may require skill and experience, but not inventive facility. But the discovery team has no instruction to follow.

This surely cannot be applied in a literal way to cases like the present, for if it were so an invention could scarcely ever be obvious, since all the routes to the desired end are likely to throw up problems, more or less knotty. This problem does not arise in the context of section 14(3). If one is asking whether the patent teaches the reader how to work the invention, the fact that it cannot be worked unless the addressee himself makes an invention must be fatal, since it demonstrates that the description is insufficient. But where one is looking at the research team, one cannot treat them as dull plodders, for such people would not be members of the team at all, except as laboratory assistants. We have to envisage people who are skilled, and skilled in the art. Here we have a difficult art, in which the skill consists in a substantial degree of an ability to solve problems. It must, I consider, follow from this that the hypothetical skilled man must be credited with that particular ability in the appropriate degree.", "\"There appears, however, to be a significant difference in the abilities of the English hypothetical skilled technician and the Canadian one.

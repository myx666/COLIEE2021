The document also informed him that the administrative investigation provided reasonable grounds for believing that he had been or was involved in certain activities jeopardizing the safety and security of the institution.

[see footnote 6] Based on the evidence submitted to the court, I consider that there is nothing to suggest that the safety of an individual or of the institution would have been affected by the disclosure of certain information. It must therefore be determined whether, in the circumstances, the inmate obtained sufficient information to be able to adequately respond to the charges laid against him."], ["[28]", "The plaintiff based his argument on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .

It has long been recognized to be only rational as well as practical that the extent and character of such a participation should depend on the circumstances of the case and the nature of the decision to be made ...", "\"In the case of a decision arrived at imposing a sanction or a punishment for the commission of an offence, fairness dictates that the person charged be given all available particulars of the offence. Not so in the case of a decision to transfer made for the sake of the orderly and proper administration of the institution and based on a belief that the inmate should, because of concerns raised as to his behaviour, not remain where he is. In such a case, there could be no basis for requiring that the inmate be given as many particulars of all the wrong doings of which he may be suspected ... In the situation we are dealing with here, guilt was not what had to be confirmed, it was whether the information received from six different sources was sufficient to raise a valid concern and warrant the transfer.", ". . . . .", "\"In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the withholding of information was almost complete and merely justified by a blanket claim ... that 'all preventive security information' is confidential and (cannot) be released.\""], ["[29]", "In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [see footnote 9] Strayer, J.A., of the Federal Court of Appeal, concurred in the comments of Marceau, J.A., and explained that, in the case of a decision involving the transfer of an inmate, the decision-maker should have serious grounds for believing that the inmate should be transferred. Accordingly, the fairness obligation also requires that the inmate receive whatever information is needed to be able to make his comments."], ["[30]", "The grounds relating to the transfer are the charges of theft from the canteen and attacking a fellow inmate. In a cross-examination Mr. Perrault admitted that the plaintiff had not participated in the conspiracy to attack the fellow inmate. What remains of the grounds supporting the belief that the plaintiff should be transferred rests with the charges regarding theft from the canteen. On the evidence submitted, the correctional service had practically no information to suggest that the plaintiff could have been involved in the theft from the canteen in one way or another."], ["[31]", "I consider that it is doubtful whether the grounds on which the decision was based were reasonable and serious. I was not persuaded that the theft charges were based on anything more than suspicion and I am unable to believe that the plaintiff's behaviour jeopardized the safety and security of the institution."], ["[32]", "In light of recent decisions of the courts, it seems to me that the plaintiff did not receive sufficient information about the grounds for his transfer and the raising of his security level to say that the rules of procedural equity were observed."], ["[33]", "The application for judicial review is accordingly allowed. I consider that the authorities' charges relating to the plaintiff's transfer and the raising of his security level will cause the latter irreparable harm when he becomes eligible to make a parole application. I therefore direct that the charges regarding his participation in the canteen theft that occurred on April 15, 1998, his involvement in the attack on a fellow inmate and the allegation regarding the storage of tobacco obtained as the result of his involvement in illegal activities be deleted from the plaintiff's record."], ["[34]", "Since this is an application for judicial review, there is no basis for awarding damages to the plaintiff.", "Application allowed.", "Editor: Gary W.

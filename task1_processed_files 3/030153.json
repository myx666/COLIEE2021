Inventors are by definition inventive. The classical touchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be asked is whether this mythical creature (the man in the Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in the light of the state of the art and of common general knowledge as at the claimed date of invention, have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very difficult test to satisfy.\""], ["[49]", "Novopharm's position, however, is undermined by its witness' (Dr. Lachman) evidence at Questions 66-77, to the effect that some outside input is necessary for the formulator to do his/her job.

Therefore, Bayer's description of the relevant POSITA is more consistent with the realities of these circumstances."], ["[50]", "At the time of the development of the '006 patent, a formulator, he/she who possesses the core skill agreed to by both parties, would have to have some knowledge or input from the clinical side."], ["[51]", "In trying to replicate this mythical POSITA, the parties advance a number of experts who, as best they can, try to describe and replicate what this POSITA would know and do. However, the one person who most nearly fits into Novopharm's thesis of the POSITA is Mr. Evans, the person with years (more years than that suggested as necessary) of experience as a formulator."], ["[52]", "The criticism of Mr. Evans is that not only has he no university degree, he has never published articles or books. It would be speculative to suggest that he was too busy engaged in formulation; the primary skill Novopharm says its POSITA requires. Whatever the reason, this absence of publications does nothing to undermine the weight to be given his evidence."], ["[53]", "Mr. Evan's evidence that a POSITA would not be led directly and without difficulty to the invention in the '006 patent and that its formulation was not obvious, significantly undercuts what Novopharm says its POSITA would conclude.", "D.", "Obviousness Double-Patenting - Specific"], ["[54]", "Novopharm's position on double-patenting and its claim to the Gillette defence are based on essentially similar grounds. The argument is that the '547 patent (which Novopharm claims is prior art) teaches dilution, which is what Novopharm has used to arrive at its formulation. Thus, Novopharm asserts that the '006 patent is making use of the same process as the '547 patent and is therefore an attempt to patent again that which was patented and for which the patent has expired."], ["[55]", "As indicated earlier, there are critical differences between the '006 patent and the '547 patent, which make it novel.

The problems caused by the '547 patent were not known outside Bayer. It took a team of experts two years to develop the solution to the intolerance problem embodied in the '006 patent. In arriving at the solution, Bayer did not merely dilute one substance but had to find the correct balance between the active compound and other elements of the drug; an exercise for which there were a myriad of permutations and combinations."], ["[59]", "The '006 patent, by the use of inventiveness and ingenuity, solved a problem created by the '547 patent.

The evidence that the formulation in the '006 patent is not obvious is compelling."], ["[62]", "The fact that Bayer would take two years of research and development to solve the problems created by the '547 patent strongly suggests that something more than what was taught in the '547 patent was needed to address the issues of physiological intolerance.

If that were the case, it is difficult to understand why Bayer did not immediately, directly and without difficulty come to the '006 patent solution.", "E.", "Gillette Defence"], ["[64]", "The Gillette defence is a plea of both non-infringement and invalidity.

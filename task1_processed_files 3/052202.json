The Applicant acknowledges that he is serving a sentence of thirteen (13) years, five (5) months and five (5) days for conspiracy to traffic in narcotics, trafficking in narcotics, possession of narcotics and laundering the proceeds of crime. The narcotic in question was heroine. The Applicant further acknowledges that he commenced serving his sentence on the 20th of December, 1996.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "In the decision of the Panel of the NPB that was appealed to the Appeal Division, the Panel wrote:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"You have been convicted of very serious offences involving trafficking in drugs over a period of time. The police undertook extensive surveillance, over three continents, of your drug dealing activities. In the 'Agreed Upon Statement of Facts' it is noted that eighty phone lines were tapped, in which two thousand drug related conversations were identified. Huge quantities of heroin, known on the street as 'China White Number Four' were being traded and it is possible that these drugs were responsible for a number of overdose deaths in British Columbia and southern Ontario. Four separate syndicates were identified and you acted as the head of the largest and most active syndicate known as the 'Big Circle Boys'. You admitted that you were the person with the most money and capital to initiate the deals. You had extensive connections in both China and Thailand with the drug trade. Enormous profits resulted from these activities and you told the Board today that you sent money to your brother in China to buy a coal mine and a taxi. You were motivated by profit, as well as by your own use of drugs, and you told the Board that, at the time, you had no thought or concern about the devastating impact that importing such large quantities of drugs would have on society.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"The Board discussed your addiction to heroin and you agreed that it had been a major problem. In 1992 you said you were using about a $1000.00 worth of heroin a week, and that you started to smoke heroin from the moment you got up in the morning. When you were interviewed at penitentiary intake, you admitted that it was only a matter of time before you would have died. The Board is concerned that you have not taken any treatment to address this problem. Your assistant pointed out that no substance abuse treatment is available in your native language, and therefore you are not responsible for this lack of programming. It is noted that you have been taking English as a Second Language for a number of years but, for whatever reason, you have not made sufficient progress to take treatment programs in English.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"While you were in Joyceville Institution you were observed to be associating with inmates involved in the drug sub-culture and, although nothing has been substantiated, you continue to be monitored. There are no negative reports from the institution indicating that you have used drugs since you have been incarcerated. The Board noted that a previously submitted community plan proposed working at a location where a fellow worker was a convicted heroin trafficker and this would suggest that you continue to have connections on the street in the world of drug dealing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"On a positive side, the Board heard that you have been taking Math in school with excellent results, and that you have had a fellow inmate translate the Cognitive Skills Program for you. Nevertheless, the Board does not feel that you have taken sufficient programming to address your risk factors.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Your plan is to be deported to China, where a brother will offer you support and employment. The Board notes that this is not the same brother that was referred to as being implicated in the drug deals. The Board remains unconvinced that you have severed all your ties with the drug trade here and in China, and notes you have the potential to become re-involved in the future. You originally came to Canada illegally. The Board has no reassurance that you will not attempt to return, especially taking into account the severe penalties for drug trafficking that are the practice in that country. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "THE DECISION UNDER REVIEW  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "In the decision under review, the Appeal Division wrote:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"You submit that the word society in the", "CCRA", "Corrections and Conditional Release Act", "] means Canadian society, and that the Board exceeds its jurisdiction when it considers the risk to other societies. You state that by interpreting society as meaning the international community and therefore denying your parole, the Board erred in law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"You submit that you have been discriminated against both in terms of language and your status as an inmate who is to be deported upon release. You argue that throughout your incarceration and at the time of your parole hearing you were deprived of your rights under section 15 and section 27 of the", "Charter", "because:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- you are required to take programs which are only provided in English, therefore you were denied access to programs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- you are required to learn English although you will be deported to a non-English speaking country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- you are required to bring a structured release plan to the Board, despite the fact that you would not be released into Canadian society where such monitoring would be possible.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ". . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"You also argue that the Board erred in law in holding that there is no reassurance that you will not attempt to return to Canada, as there is no evidence that you would attempt to return to Canada. You explain that you have immediate employment in China, and the majority of your family lives there. You also say that you have never appealed your deportation order to China.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"... It is important to understand that the Board assesses risk in a similar manner, regardless of whether an offender is released in Canada or is deportable to another country. In any pre-release case, the Board must take into consideration the criteria of undue risk to society (not only Canadian society) in assessing risk.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"With respect to your programming, it is CSC [the Correctional Service of Canada] that has responsibility for programming and treatment of offenders. Therefore, your complaints regarding the availability of programs should be directed to CSC. ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ". . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"We find that the Board was well aware of the fact that because of your situation, you could not provide a supervised release plan.

That being said, since the essence of the decision of the Appeal Division is the affirmation of a decision of a panel of the NPB that was before it on appeal, I am satisfied that it is entirely appropriate to consider the panel decision in arriving at a determination of whether the Appeal Division erred in a reviewable manner in any respect.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "b) Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "Counsel for the Applicant did not address the issue of standard of review, either in written submissions or in oral submissions at hearing.

As the NPB is charged with the responsibility of balancing \"society's\", whatever that term may mean, interest with that of offenders such as the Applicant, I am satisfied that the NPB's mandate supports, on the facts of this matter, a more deferential approach to the NPB's decisions. Finally, the substantive issues on this application for judicial review are largely questions of law and as such justify a less deferential approach to the decision of the Appeal Board that is here at issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "Against the foregoing considerations, I am satisfied that the appropriate standard of review of the decision of the Appeal Board, on the particular facts of this matter, is not patent unreasonableness but rather reasonableness simpliciter.

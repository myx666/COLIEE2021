In August 2010, the Family applied for permanent residence under the Convention Refugee Abroad and Humanitarian Protected Persons Abroad class. Farshad completed his Schedule 1 - Background/Declaration (Schedule 1) and Schedule 2 - Refugees Outside of Canada (Schedule 2) forms on 1 December 2010. The rest of the Family's forms are not in the Certified Tribunal Record (CTR) before the Court."], ["[4]", "The Applicants and the rest of their Family were sponsored to Canada by the Yousufi Group (Sponsor), under a \"Group of Five\" sponsorship, which allows groups of five or more Canadian citizens or permanent residents to sponsor refugees to Canada. The Sponsor was represented by Shekiba Yousufi, Habibollah's sister-in-law. In form IMM 5373 - Undertaking/Application to Sponsor - Groups of Five, the Sponsor said the Family had a well-founded fear of persecution, noting that they were robbed on one occasion. The Sponsor also noted that the Family could not live in peace in Afghanistan because they have young children, young girls are frequently kidnapped, and young men are forced to join the Taliban."], ["[5]", "In Schedule 2, Farshad said that he was always afraid he would be forced to join the Taliban. He noted that the Family had been supported by their other family in Canada and that, in Tajikistan, they could not work or study. He also said that, since leaving Afghanistan, he had not had the opportunity to work."], ["[6]", "On 8 February 2011, the Immigration Section at the Canadian Embassy in Moscow, Russia (Immigration Section) scheduled the Applicants for an interview on 15 March 2011. On 3 March 2011, the Sponsor confirmed that they would attend."], ["[7]", "On 15 March 2011, the Officer interviewed the Applicants separately with the assistance of an interpreter.

She also informed him that his answers were confidential. Farshad confirmed that he understood the instructions and the interpreter. The Officer then asked about his travel history, and he said the Family arrived in Tajikistan on 1 November 2010. In Habibollah's interview, he said that the family had gone to Kazakhstan from Afghanistan in March 2009. He also said they arrived in Tajikistan four months before the interview (approximately December 2010), but he forgot the exact month."], ["[9]", "Farshad said at his interview that neither he nor any of his family members had ever been affiliated with the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan - the communist party which overthrew the Afghan government in 1978. He also said that he had never been recruited or provided material support to any armed groups and that no one in his family had ever worked for KHAD - the Afghan intelligence agency."], ["[10]", "The Officer then asked Farshad to explain everything that led to his departure from Afghanistan. He said that the economic situation there was weak; although three members of his family worked in one shop, they did not have enough money to feed themselves. He described one occasion when, after picnicking in a park outside of Herat, the city in Afghanistan where they lived, the Family was set upon by burglars (Burglars) as they were leaving to go home. The Burglars forced the family out of their car and stole their possessions, including phone bills, a driver's licence, cash, and gold ornaments. They then tied up and beat Habibollah and warned the Family not to go to the police. The Burglars said that if the Family went to the police, things would go badly for them."], ["[11]", "The Family was released by the Burglars but had to return home on foot. During their journey, police stopped them at a checkpoint. The Family told the police what happened to them, so the police sent two cars after the Burglars. The police went to the location of the robbery, but did not find the Burglars. They told Habibollah to report to the police station the next day to make a statement and said that the Family would be informed if anything was found."], ["[12]", "Eight months after contacting the police, the Family received a letter from the Burglars. This letter said that the police had caught some of them and told them to go to the police and recant; if they did not, the letter said the Burglars would kidnap the daughters and kill the sons. The Family received a second letter from the Burglars some time after this."], ["[13]", "After Farshad told his story, the Officer asked him to explain why he was afraid or unwilling to return to Afghanistan. Farshad said the economic situation there was weak and that, after the Family received the threatening letters, they realized they could not return. When asked if there was anywhere in Afghanistan he could be safe, he said the situation was terrible and that they had no choice because they had nothing."], ["[14]", "After hearing the Applicants' stories, the Officer had several concerns. She thought that the Applicants could have applied for refugee status in Tajikistan or Kazakhstan. The Officer presented this concern to the Applicants and asked for their comments. Habibollah said they did not need to claim protection in Kazakhstan because it was easy to get a visa. However, the Family left Kazakhstan when the authorities changed their policy and stopped giving visas to Afghans. Habibollah also said they did not apply for refugee status in Tajikistan because they thought they did not need it. Farshad said that people in Kazakhstan were racist and did not like them, so they left."], ["[15]", "In each of their interviews, the Officer asked the Applicants why they could not move to another region in Afghanistan to get away from the Burglars. Habibollah said in his interview that Afghanistan was not safe anywhere. Farshad said they had nothing in Afghanistan and would be killed; he also said they had no home or education there. The Officer also confronted the Applicants with her concern that their reasons for leaving Afghanistan seemed to be more economic than related to persecution. She said that they did not seem to be facing persecution related to any of the Convention grounds and their reason for leaving was related to the general instability and economic situation in Afghanistan. Habibollah said that none of the family worked in Tajikistan, that they were moving from one home to another, and that they had no money. He also said that his daughter could be in second grade. Farshad did not address this concern in his interview."], ["[16]", "After concluding the interviews, the Officer considered the applications and made her Decision.

She noted that they had been interviewed with the assistance of an interpreter on 15 March 2011."], ["[19]", "In the CAIPS notes, the Officer found that Farshad was a victim of crime, not persecution. She also found that his explanation of events subsequent to the robbery lacked credibility. Although he was afraid the Burglars would find him, he said the Family received two letters from them. The Officer found that, if the Burglars truly wanted to threaten Farshad or the rest of the Family, they would have gone to their home. She also found that it was unclear why the Burglars would send letters rather than threatening the Applicants at home and that this reduced the credibility of their story."], ["[20]", "The Officer also noted that Farshad had lived in Kazakhstan for eighteen months and Tajikistan for four months, but had not claimed refugee status in either country. She found that the reasons he had given for not claiming in those countries lacked credibility. Had he and his Family considered themselves refugees, the Officer found that they would have claimed in either Kazakhstan or Tajikistan. This would have allowed them to work or attend school. The Officer concluded that she was not satisfied Farshad met the definition of a Convention refugee, that he met the criteria for the Country of Asylum Class, or that he met the requirements of the Act, so she refused his application."], ["[21]", "In the June Letter, the Officer reviewed the requirements of section 96 of the Act and sections 145 and 147 of the", "Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations", "SOR 2002-227 (Regulations). She noted that Afghanistan is not one of the source countries currently recognized by Canada for the Source Country class. The Officer said that, after assessing all the factors in their applications, she was not satisfied that Farshad was a member of any of the classes prescribed. She based this conclusion on her finding that the Applicants did not seem to be facing persecution in Afghanistan, but that they were unwilling to return because of the general instability and poor economic situation there. The Officer noted that section 11 of the Act prohibits an officer from issuing a visa unless she is satisfied that an applicant meets the requirements of the act; because Farshad did not meet these requirements, she could not issue him a permanent resident visa.", "ISSUES"], ["[22]", "The Applicants raise the following issues in this application:", "a.

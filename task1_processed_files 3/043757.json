Further, under s. 34(1)(f), a foreign national is inadmissible for being a member of an organization \"that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages,", "has engaged", "or will engage in acts referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c)\". By finding that the EPRP is not an \"organization\" because, at the time of Mr. Gebreab's membership, it did not engage in acts of terrorism or subversion, the Board would, in effect, eliminate the words \"they have occurred\" from s. 33 and the words \"has engaged\" from s. 34(1)(f)."], ["[28]", "Given that there are no required factors, the issue becomes whether the Board, in determining the s. 37(1) issues before it, asked itself the right questions.

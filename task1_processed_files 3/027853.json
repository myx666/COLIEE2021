In this regard, the applicant relies on", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ImmLR (4th) 57 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], to argue that \"where credibility, accuracy or the genuine nature of information is in question, a duty also exists to give an opportunity to an applicant to disabuse an officer of any concerns that may arise\" (also relying on", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).

On the basis of this distinction, the applicant relies strongly on paragraph 24 in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and asserts that the Officer had a duty to provide him with an opportunity to address his concerns regarding the authenticity of the documents provided in support of his application. Justice Mosley in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 24, observed the following:"], ["[24] Having reviewed the factual context of the cases cited above, it is clear that where a concern arises directly from the requirements of the legislation or related regulations, a visa officer will not be under a duty to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address his or her concerns.", "Where however the issue is not one that arises in this context, such a duty may arise.

In other words, Justice Mosley did not rule that there is", "necessarily", "a duty to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address his or her concerns when they arise outside the context of requirements pursuant to the legislation or related regulations."], ["[22]", "Likewise, the use of the word", "often", "is another indication that such a duty is not necessarily triggered even where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant is at issue. Depending on the circumstances, this duty may simply not arise. Here, the Officer referred to the fact that the reference letters from past employers were most probably fabricated for immigration purposes."], ["[23]", "The Court observes, for instance, that the Officer noticed that the letters at pages 72, 73 and 74 of the Tribunal Record have the same font. He also noticed that the business cards make reference to a @yahoo.com and a @gmail.com email addresses, but not to a corporate email. Two (2) letters from two (2) different employers are signed on the same day, using the same type of paper with both letterheads printed in poor quality ink-jet and are otherwise quite alike (Tribunal Record, pp 72 and 73). The Officer further noticed that the duties enumerated in the letter from Cirico are nearly copied from the NOC. The applicant's comparative table between the NOC and the reference letters submitted to the Court failed to convince this Court (Applicant's Reply, para 6). Furthermore, the Officer noted that it would be unlikely for a company to hire the applicant for a position (Construction Project Manager) for which he had no apparent previous experience (Tribunal Record, p 8). Thus, on the basis of this information, the Court is of the opinion that the Officer's decision was reasonable."], ["[24]", "Following the decision to the effect that the application was ineligible for processing and hence refused, the applicant attempted to perfect his application (Tribunal Record, pp 41-42). For instance, he explained that the use of ink-jet printers and the particular type of paper used by the employers is common practice for businesses in Nigeria (Applicant's Record, Applicant's Affidavit, p 16; Affidavit of Arinze Samuel Chukwudile, p 49), and that the font used on the letters is a default font on many computers in Nigeria (Applicant's Record, Applicant's affidavit, paras 31-32, pp 16-17). The Court agrees with the respondent that these statements made by the applicant in his own affidavit with respect to generalized business practice in Nigeria as to the paper, printer and font typically used are self-serving statements.

Also, and contrary to the applicant's submission, there is no such absolute duty on the Officer where the application, on its face, is void of credibility. In terms of sufficient information, the onus will not shift on the Officer simply on the basis that the application is \"complete\". The applicant has the burden to put together an application that is not only \"complete\" but relevant, convincing and unambiguous (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 548; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 26).

Nevertheless, a refusal may still be valid in law, notwithstanding that the visa officer did not fully comply with the process outlined in the OP Manual. Rather than being a mandatory provision, the Board noted that the OP Manual should be viewed as an indication of best practices that officers should aspire to. The Board held that the applicant bears the onus of understanding the content of documents she signs and cannot later avoid the implication of her signature by claiming she did not understand what she was signing."], ["[18]", "The Board also noted that although the applicant submitted that she did not have legal advice, the declaration was sent to a consultant acting as her husband's advisor who then forwarded it to the applicant and asked her to sign a form about her daughter.

The Board noted that regardless of whether it is intentional, the jurisprudence has confirmed that non-disclosure is enough to bar an applicant from sponsoring her/his child. In this case, the applicant's daughter was not examined at the time of her immigration application to Canada.

In assessing whether there was a breach of natural justice, the Board was limited to considering the evidence before the visa officer in 2005.

The Board erred by not responding to this, but rather restricting itself to the visa officer's obligation to advise the applicant about the consequences of not having her daughter examined."], ["[33]", "The applicant notes that her submissions to the Board were not limited to the visa officer's failure to follow the guidelines set out in the OP Manual, but also pertained to the lack of instructions provided by the visa officer to the applicant regarding the declaration. The visa officer provided no explanation about the medical examination for the applicant's daughter.

The patent, granted to Merck in October 1990 and expiring in October 2007, contains claims for, among other things, the compound known as lisinopril, which belongs to a family of ACE [see footnote 1] inhibitors used in the reduction of hypertension.

I do not understand Rule 385 to authorize a case management judge or prothonotary, in giving directions that are necessary for the 'just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of the proceeding on its merits' to enable them to deny a party the legal right to have questions answered on examination for discovery which are relevant to the issues in the pleadings. That right is not merely 'theoretical' (as the prothonotary put it) but is clearly spelled out in Rule 240 and I do not take the general words of Rule 385(1)(a) or of Rule 3 to be sufficient to override that specific right. I would also observe that the word 'just' which appears in both these rules relied on by the respondents and the decision-makers below confirms that justice is not to be subordinated to expedition.", "A person who is a party to a civil action is entitled to ask any question on discovery that is relevant to the issue: that is a matter of justice to him, subject of course to the discretionary power of the prothonotary or a judge to disallow the question where it is abusive for one of the reasons mentioned above.

Indeed Apotex relies upon his evidence, as well as that of Doctors Marshall and MacLelland, to argue that the information about the compounds he examined, including the non-disclosed compounds, is highly relevant to its defence."], ["[55]", "The decision to accept the Merck evidence and dismiss the motions to compel was not made in a vacuum. It arose in the context of prolonged proceedings in which there had been already many days of discovery and the production of 2076 documents comprising some 20,000 pages. Prothonotary Morneau has been involved in these proceedings as the case management prothonotary for over four years. In my view, the exercise of his discretion in this matter deserves considerable deference."], ["[56]", "Apotex has, thus far, led no evidence in the form of test results or other data to establish its allegations. Nor is it required to at this stage of the proceedings. But having reviewed the substantial quantity of material filed on this motion and in particular the cross-examination transcripts, it appears that the defence strategy, apart from continued reliance on the pre-patent acquisitions, is to find support for Apotex' pleadings in the Merck research archives. This has led Apotex into what may properly, in my view, be characterized as a highly speculative \"fishing expedition\"."], ["[57]", "Apotex submits that Prothonotary Morneau misappreciated the pleadings when he focussed on the improper divisional application allegation, but did not fully consider the relevance of the evidence as it relates to sound prediction and the other allegations of invalidity. The decision does focus on the improper divisional allegation, but not unduly in my view. Many if not most of the questions in issue appear to be related to this allegation."], ["[58]", "Apotex submits that its questions sought information and facts from the inventors about what they had undertaken, and did not seek legal or patent interpretations or opinions. While many of the questions appear to be seeking facts on the surface, it was open to the Prothonotary to infer that those \"facts\" were really about the interpretation of evidence or opinions and decline to compel them within the exceptions recognized in", "Reading &  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."], ["[59]", "Apotex is asking me to substitute my assessment of the relevance of the questions and documents sought and arrive at conclusions different from those reached by the prothonotary. While I may have arrived at different results had I been hearing this matter at first instance, I should not substitute my discretion for that of the learned prothonotary unless he has made a fundamental error of principle or misapprehended the evidence or the pleadings. Overall, I see no reason to interfere with his decision."], ["[60]", "However, I have concluded that Prothonotary Morneau erred in dismissing the relevance of the undisclosed 76 chemical structures, among the 226 examined by Dr. Charette, to the resolution of the final issues in this case."], ["[61]", "Prothonotary Morneau was satisfied that Apotex had enough information from what was disclosed about the 150 structures to develop its thesis about the scope of the claims in the '340 and '198 applications. Apotex argues that the fact that Dr. Charette was provided with materials to perform his analysis establishes that those materials are relevant, and can easily be produced, and so they should be."], ["[62]", "Merck put Dr. Charette forward as a witness to give evidence about the classification of the 226 compounds and provided him with the chemical structures of each for that purpose. In doing so, they established the relevance of that evidence. It is also apparent that the information is readily available and would not impose a burden on Merck to produce. Dr. Charette had it in front of him during his cross-examination. The record indicates that Merck intends to use extrapolations from that information at trial to rebut Apotex allegations of one invention, inoperability and inutility. In those circumstances, the information is in my view \"vital\" to the final issues in the case and the Prothonotary erred in not ordering its disclosure to the defendant. Accordingly, I will exercise the discretion that he should have and make that order."], ["[63]", "I am not satisfied that the other questions raised in the motion are vital to the final issue of the case, nor that Prothonotary Morneau made fundamental errors or misapprehended the evidence in respect of those questions. Accordingly, I will not interfere with his order other than to amend it to require the production of the 76 chemical structures in the form provided by Merck to Dr. Charette for his examination and not otherwise disclosed to the defendant. This appeal motion is otherwise dismissed and the Merck representatives and witnesses will not have to reappear for the continuation of examination for discovery.", "COSTS"], ["[64]", "A great deal of time and effort has been expended by the parties, as well as by the Court, in these proceedings. Much of that is attributable, in my view, to what I have characterized above as a fishing expedition on the part of Apotex. While the result has been somewhat divided, Merck has achieved the greater success and shall have its costs on the normal basis in accordance with column III of the table to Tariff B."], ["[65]", "The role of Syngenta Limited, AstraZeneca UK Limited and AstraZeneca Canada Inc. in these proceedings was limited to filing slim written representations and making brief oral submissions in support of Merck. In effect, they were simply monitoring the proceedings.

The Applicant says that his group was raided by agents of the Public Security Bureau (PSB) on 22 August 2009. The instructor and two members of the group were arrested at that time. After the raid, the Applicant went into hiding and, on 23 August 2009, PSB agents went to his home to look for him. While they were at his home, the PSB interrogated his mother and brother, and then left a Notice of Summoning (Notice), which required him to attend at the PSB office in Chang Le.

To establish the authenticity of his documents, the RPD sent them to the RCMP Forensic Science and Identification Services Laboratory (RCMP Lab) for analysis. In its report (Forensic Report) the RCMP Lab said it did not have a genuine specimen for comparison, so the authenticity of the Applicant's RIC was inconclusive. The Forensic Report also noted that the RIC was printed with an inkjet printer and that this was not known as a means for printing genuine RICs."], ["[8]", "At the hearing, the RPD presented the Applicant with the Forensic Report and asked him to comment. He said that his RIC was in his possession at all times, except when it was with the smuggler he hired to bring him to Canada.

For a person exposed to Christian practices and doctrine for only 2 1/2 years, Mr. Chen exhibited a reasonable level of knowledge. It was unfair to criticize him for an inability to locate the story of Noah's Ark in the Bible. Many Christians who have grown-up in the faith would fare no better than Mr. Chen: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2007 FC 101 at para. 16."], ["[60]", "Similarly, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Richard Mosley determined that the RPD acted unreasonably when it concluded that the claimant was not a Christian based on insufficient knowledge of Christianity. Justice Mosley found that the RPD had engaged in an overly stringent and microscopic examination of the claimant's religious knowledge. He said, at paragraphs 10 and 11, that the claimant", "was raised in a country where the Christian faith is not part of the social fabric. From the transcript of the hearing, it is clear that his few points of error on doctrinal issues are vastly outweighed by his knowledge of the Christian faith. The RPD appears to have been overly focused on those few points of error or misunderstandings to a level which reached the microscopic analysis criticized in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and subsequent cases.", "The Board member's standard for knowledge of Christian doctrine was unrealistically high, and she was clearly weighing his description of a standard service at the underground church against her own idea of how a service unfolds. I cannot find her decision reasonable, given the personal circumstances of the applicant and his evidence."], ["[61]", "Given the low bar this Court has set for claimants seeking protection to demonstrate religious knowledge, it is my view that, as in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the RPD in this case engaged in an overly stringent and microscopic examination of the Applicant's knowledge of Falun Gong. It erroneously weighed his testimony on this issue against its own misguided idea of what a person in the Applicant's circumstances should or would know or understand. I agree with the Applicant that, in so doing, the RPD based its finding that he is not a Falun Gong practitioner on unattainable and unreasonable requirements for knowledge of the practice. The RPD also failed to consider the fact that, as Justice Francis Muldoon said in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  \"refugee claimants come from diverse cultures, and actions which appear implausible when judged from Canadian standards might be plausible when considered from within the claimant's milieu.\""], ["[62]", "For the above reasons, the Decision is unreasonable and must be returned."], ["[63]", "Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[64]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "1. The application is allowed. The decision is quashed and the matter is returned for reconsideration by a differently constituted RPD.", "2. There is no question for certification.", "Application allowed.", "Editor: Angela E. McKay/klf", "[End of document]"]]}

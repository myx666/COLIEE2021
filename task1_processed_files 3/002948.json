She became debilitated and the applicant became her primary caregiver. The added burden caused the applicant to be stressed and to believe that human life was \"painful and meaningless\". In mid-February, 2006, the applicant's best friend introduced him to Christianity as a means of solving his problems and in late February took him to a service at an underground church.

The group dispersed, and the applicant went to his cousin's house to hide. Two days later, while still in hiding, the applicant received a phone call from his wife informing him that PSB officers had visited his home and were looking for him.

In short, the Board did not believe his story."], ["[7]", "The Board based its finding on the negative inferences it drew from inconsistencies in the answers provided by the applicant to questions relating to his wife's medical documents; the exclusion of his wife from the introduction to Christianity; his knowledge of the risk inherent to attendance at an underground church prior to his first service; his knowledge regarding the procedure when a pastor is or is not present during underground services; the legal procedures utilized by the PSB to take people into custody; and his knowledge of Christianity and the Pentecostal faith."], ["[8]", "Regarding the assessment of Mr. Cao's Christian knowledge, the Board member acknowledged that the applicant was able to answer a number of questions, but noted that he was unable to answer questions concerning the Pentecostal faith he professed to follow that, in the member's view, any practicing Pentecostal Christian should know. The member determined that whatever knowledge of Christianity and Pentecostalism the applicant may possess was largely obtained in Toronto and only for the purpose of supporting his invented claim. The member found that the applicant's claim was fraudulent and was made in bad faith."], ["[9]", "The member concluded that the claimant had failed to satisfy his burden of establishing a serious possibility that he would be persecuted or that he would be personally subjected to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or a risk of torture by any authority in the PRC.

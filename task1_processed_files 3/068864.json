The issue, however, is whether he is entitled to a disability pension pursuant to the", "Canada Pension Plan", ". He is eligible to apply for a pension based on the contributions he had made to the Plan. Because of the timing of his contributions, his minimum qualifying period ended on 31 December 2003. To receive the pension, he must show that his disability existed on or prior to that date and continuously thereafter. Section 42(2) of the Plan provides that a person shall be considered to be disabled only if he or she has a severe and prolonged mental or physical disability. A disability is \"severe\" if the person is incapable regularly of pursuing any substantially gainful employment (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 324, at paragraph 50; and", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 385, at paragraphs 14-17).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[2]", "Mr. Skrzypek's application was first dismissed on the grounds that he did not have a severe and prolonged physical disability as of 31 December 2003. The Plan sets out a series of reconsiderations and appeals available to a person dissatisfied with an initial decision such as this one.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "Under section 81, the Minister was called upon to reconsider the initial decision. He confirmed it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "Unsatisfied with that reconsideration, Mr. Skrzypek then appealed to the Review Tribunal in accordance with section 82. The Tribunal also ruled against him.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The next step is an appeal to the Pension Appeals Board. The appeal is not of right. Leave must be obtained from the chairman, the vice-chairman, or a designated member of the Board. Section 83(3) provides that where leave to appeal is refused, written reasons must be given. The Act does not specify that written reasons need be given when leave is granted. In this case, as is fairly usual, the application for leave was made ex parte and leave was granted without prior notice to the Minister by the designated member. No reasons were given. This is a judicial review of that decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "ISSUES  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "The Attorney General, on behalf of the Minister, raises a number of issues. The primary issue in this case, in my opinion, is that the required procedure was not respected.

I agree with the Attorney General's submissions. Without such reasons, one can only speculate as to whether the designated member was aware of the legal test to be applied on applications for leave and whether his assessment of the record in applying that test was reasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The Attorney General also submitted that the decision was not \"recorded\" in that all that was received was a letter from the Board.

If new evidence is adduced with the application, if the application raises an issue of law or of relevant significant facts not appropriately considered by the Review Tribunal in its decision, an arguable issue is raised for consideration and it warrants the grant of leave.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "As I stated in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] F.C.J.

As noted by Mr. Justice Lemieux in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 142, another case in which no reasons had been given for the granting of leave, at paragraph 29, where leave is granted without reasons, the application for leave itself may stand in the place of the absent reasons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "While Justice Deyell did not provide written reasons for his grant of leave, I hold, for the purposes of this judicial review application, the Minister's identification of arguable issues in his ex parte written application for leave to appeal are deemed to be the reasons for the grant of leave.

The Review Tribunal found that he suffered and continued to suffer to a varying degree from the medical problems described. Notwithstanding, the Review Tribunal did not accept that his physical problems were severe or prolonged on or before the date of his MQP and continuously thereafter. The Review Tribunal accepted that the Appellant believed that he was unable to work at any substantially gainful job on or before the date of his MQP; however, the Review Tribunal did not agree. The Appellant suffered to some degree from medical problems referred to above and likely still does, as revealed by his testimony and the medical evidence summarized above. His medical problems, on a balance of probabilities, did not render him incapable regularly or pursuing any substantially gainful occupation on or before the date of his MQP, December 31, 2003 and continuously thereafter.

The cumulative consideration of information demonstrated that the problems caused by the Appellant's medical conditions were not severe and prolonged as is required.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "However, if the designated member did indeed think that the Review Tribunal erred in assessing the evidence, then it was up to him to say so.

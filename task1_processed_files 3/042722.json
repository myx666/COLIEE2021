In 1991, the applicant was diagnosed HIV positive. At this time he was living in Mexico. The applicant claimed that his employer discovered his illness and offered him a severance package or he would be fired. The applicant also submitted that he was fired again from another job in 1995 because his employer discovered his sexual orientation and illness. The applicant attempted to start his own business, but it subsequently closed."], ["[6]", "When the applicant's stepfather passed away, he shared equally in the estate which included a sugar plantation, a coffee plantation and a house. The applicant claimed that in 1996, one of his brothers threatened to kill him if he did not leave Mexico. As a result, the applicant claims to have given his sister power of attorney to deal with the family properties and left for the United States where he remained for approximately nine years without returning to Mexico. The applicant returned to Mexico in April 2005, remained for a matter of days and then travelled to Canada. Shortly after his arrival in Canada, the applicant applied for refugee protection. In a decision dated October 9, 2007, the Board found that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection. This is the judicial review of the Board's decision.", "Board's Decision"], ["[7]", "The Board's determination was that the applicant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection because of the availability of adequate state protection and a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) to Mexico City."], ["[8]", "The Board began its analysis by stating the two part test to be applied in determining whether there was an IFA: 1. there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFA area; and 2. conditions in the IFA area must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, for the claimant to seek refuge there. Related to the first prong, the Board first assessed the fear from the applicant's brothers. The Board accepted that the applicant had provided evidence suggesting that his brothers had harassed and assaulted him, but noted that there was no documentary evidence to show that he had sought medical attention. Also, the applicant had not claimed refugee protection during his years in the United States as a result of the harassment and assaults. The Board also noted that when asked if handing over his share of the family property would eliminate the problems with his family, the applicant responded \"yes\". The Board found that \"it is not unreasonable to expect the claimant to dispose of his portion of the inheritance if by doing so he could stop the alleged agent of persecution from harming him.\" The Board went on to state that in any event it questioned \"the likelihood that the claimant's brother would carry through with the alleged threat to kill him\". The Board discussed how even after the death threat was made towards the applicant, there were numerous instances of contact between the applicant and his brothers and as such, they have had numerous opportunities to kill him. The Board found that \"while the threats are doubtlessly unsettling for the claimant\" the applicant did not face a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of his brothers."], ["[9]", "The Board then turned its attention to whether the applicant's sexual orientation undermined Mexico City as an IFA. The Board reviewed the documentary evidence and found that \"in weighing all the evidence, [...] the most current documentation persuades the panel that laws and efforts of the state have had a positive impact for shortcomings that may have occurred in the past.\" The Board went on to state that the applicant had the burden of providing \"clear and convincing proof\" of the state's inability to protect. The Board noted that the last incident, in which the police targeted the applicant occurred in 1989 and the documentary evidence showed that since then much had changed in Mexico City."], ["[10]", "The Board then discussed whether the applicant's HIV positive status undermined Mexico City as an IFA. The Board stated that the documentary evidence on HIV positive status indicated that in August 2003, then President Vicente Fox, announced that the government would subsidize medication costs. The Board stated that this was \"a major initiative that was not available to the claimant when he was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1991\"."], ["[11]", "Related to the second prong of the IFA test, the Board stated \"given that the claimant is an educated person who has worked, while he was in Mexico, both in the private sector and as a business owner, and given the existence of anti-discriminatory legislation in the Federal District the panel determines that it is not unreasonable, under the circumstances, for him to live in Mexico City\"."], ["[12]", "The Board's final conclusion was that there existed an IFA to Mexico City and adequate state protection for the applicant. As such, the Board rejected his claim for refugee status.", "Issues"], ["[13]", "The applicant submitted the following issues for consideration:", "1. Did the Board err at law by assessing the applicant's refugee claim solely on the basis of his sexual orientation and fail to assess and consider the fact of the applicant's HIV positive status when determining if he has a viable IFA in Mexico City?", "2. Did the Board make numerous critical findings of fact, including those on objective country conditions in Mexico City, without a clear evidentiary basis and thus amounting to sheer speculation?", "3.

Did the Board err in finding that the trauma described in the psychological report was not exclusively related to issues identified in the claim?", "3.

The applicant submitted that he provided ample evidence to show that since his diagnosis, he has faced severe discrimination and harassment amounting to cumulative harassment and persecution (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2004 FC 649). The applicant claimed that in applying the two pronged test for an IFA, the Board failed to consider the kind of life the applicant has as an HIV positive person living in Mexico City. It was submitted that the Board erred in only considering the availability of medicine for HIV positive individuals. The Board should have considered all the circumstances feared by people in the applicant's position such as physical abuse, extortion and denial of proper employment, housing and services. The applicant also submitted that in analyzing whether an IFA existed the Board erred in relying on evidence from 2003 and then stating that \"the most current documentation persuades the panel that laws and efforts of the state have had a positive impact for shortcomings that may have occurred in the past\". The applicant alleged that the Board has a duty to seek out the most current information."], ["[16]", "The applicant submitted that a number of the Board's findings were baseless and made without providing reasons.

The applicant argued that the Board erred in finding that the trauma affirmed in the psychological report was not \"exclusively related to issues identified in [the] claim.\" The applicant submitted that there was no evidence upon which to base this finding and the Board failed to give reasons for it. The applicant also submitted that the Board erred in finding that it was not unreasonable to expect the applicant to give up his inheritance to eliminate the possibility of persecution from his brothers. The applicant argued that there was no evidence before the Board to support that the reason and motive for the applicant's brothers' hatred of him was due to his receiving a portion of his step-father's property. Moreover, the evidence showed that the problems with the applicant's brothers began before his stepfather passed away. And finally, the applicant submitted that the Board erred in finding that the applicant was not at risk of being persecuted by his brothers. It was argued that the Board found that the applicant's brothers may assault him, but they would not go as far as to kill him. The applicant submitted that this is nonetheless persecution."], ["[17]", "And finally, the applicant argued that the Board misunderstood the applicant's testimony during the hearing. The Board in its reasons stated that when asked if giving up his share in the inheritance would end his brothers' hatred of him, the applicant responded \"yes\".

In a functioning democracy with the apparatus and the willingness to provide its citizens with some measure of protection, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The respondent submitted that the applicant's argument that the Board failed to assess the protection available for HIV positive persons (with the exception of the availability of medicine) cannot be accepted because the evidence upon which the applicant relies is not sufficiently material to contradict the Board's state protection finding. The respondent submitted that the portions of country documentation cited by the applicant in the memorandum speak generally of discrimination against people who are HIV positive and not whether state protection is available. Therefore, the evidence presented was far from the \"clear and convincing\" evidence required to rebut the well-established presumption that the Board considered all the evidence."], ["[21]", "With regards to the second prong of the IFA test, the respondent submitted that the applicant has failed to show that the discrimination HIV positive persons face in Mexico City amounts to persecution.

The Board did not address this issue particular to the applicant's circumstances as an HIV positive Mexican."], ["[33]", "Furthermore, while the respondent is correct in pointing out that lack of employment is generally not a sufficient reason to determine that an IFA is unreasonable, barriers to employment affect an HIV positive Mexican in an uniquely discriminatory way. The documentary evidence submitted by the applicant suggests that medical testing for HIV status for employment purposes is prevalent in Mexico from factories to professional positions. Despite the fact that the applicant has been successful in obtaining positions in the past, the documentary evidence suggests that the applicant may face restrictions in earning a livelihood because of his HIV status.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 75 F.T.R. 125 (T.D.), systemic governmental inference with the opportunity to find work was found to be a serious restraint on an individual. In this case, the Board did not adequately address whether the applicant had proven that systemic barriers associated with HIV testing and employment amounted to persecution on a balance of probabilities. The interrelated aspects of the applicant's socio-economic status and HIV positive status are important considerations that the Board overlooked."], ["[34]", "The Federal Court of Appeal established, however, that there is a very narrow foundation for a refugee claim based on access to medical treatment.

This is where nevertheless, in the domain of refugee law, that particular social groups such as HIV positive individuals have established a foundation for successful refugee claims."], ["[35]", "The issue of discrimination is particularly important because of the potential for the applicant to experience ostracism from friends and family if returned to Mexico. As stated above, systemic barriers to employment may preclude access to private health care. The applicant may have to depend upon public medical care which can be inadequate. Inadequate health care in itself, is not a foundation for a claim (if it is delivered in a non-discriminatory manner, as above). However, the documentary evidence suggests that in Mexico, families of HIV positive Mexicans play an important role in caring for people in the position of the applicant because of societal discrimination. The documentary evidence provides instances where HIV positive friends living in Mexico had to rely on family to get medical insurance because of barriers to employment or had to rely on family to pay for medications of the black market."], ["[36]", "The applicant does not appear to have this option. The applicant testified that no one in his family knows that he is HIV positive and that their reaction would be very negative with the exception of his sister. The applicant has been threatened and assaulted by his brothers related to property holdings as well as his sexual orientation. Further, his relationship with them prevents his mother and sister from contact with him because of the threat of retaliation. There is a police report documenting an assault against the sister from one of the brothers related to the brother's conflict with the applicant. Further, when the applicant last returned to Mexico City, the mother was not able to see her son because of his brothers. Despite the close relationship with his sister, she is a single mother of two children with little money and does not live in Mexico City.

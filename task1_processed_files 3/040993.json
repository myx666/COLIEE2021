I know of no legal authority that gives the Applicant legal rights in Canada in this situation. Justice O'Keefe has already ruled that section 7 of the Charter was not directly engaged by the exclusion of the Applicant from refugee protection. See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraphs 69-74."], ["[71]", "The Applicant is no different from any other foreign national living in his own country and facing legal proceedings in that country. He has no legal claim on Canada. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and", "Suresh", "have no application here because those were pre-deportation cases, and the individuals concerned were under the control of Canada at the time they sought relief from the Court. Also, there is no Canadian state actor in this case who has participated in, or condoned, any mistreatment the Applicant may have suffered at the hands of Chinese officials. See", "Hape", ", above."], ["[72]", "As the Respondent points out, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Edmond Blanchard made it clear that in order to advance a section 7 Charter right, an applicant must establish a nexus to Canada by being present in Canada, by there being criminal proceedings in Canada, or by Canadian citizenship. The Applicant's only connection with Canada is that he came here as a visitor, remained here illegally and then took full advantage of our refugee protection system, and was then legally deported back to China. At present, he has no connection with Canada."], ["[73]", "In addition, there is no acceptable evidence before me that the Applicant is being treated by Chinese officials in a way that would breach a Charter right, did any such right exist. The Applicant has not proven, on a balance of probabilities, that he has been subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by Chinese authorities. The only sworn direct evidence I have before me on point is contained in the affidavit of Ms. Wu, the Applicant's daughter-in-law, and she tells us nothing about any breaches of due process or bad treatment by the Chinese authorities. The Applicant seeks to overcome this difficulty by suggesting that the quality of the evidence required to establish human rights violations against him in China is not required when all he is asking is that he receive a reply to his 27 February 2012 request. However, in my view, the request for a reply does not in itself engage any Charter rights on these facts."], ["[74]", "All of this means that, irrespective of whether the Applicant is seeking to compel a further answer to his letter from the Canadian government, or to compel the Canadian government to act by making representations to Chinese officials on his behalf, the Applicant has established no public legal duty to act and no Charter violation by Canadian state actors. Anything which Canada may choose to do on his behalf lies squarely within the Crown prerogative over foreign affairs and, in this regard, where there is no constitutional or Charter infringement, the Court cannot intervene. See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraphs 35-37."], ["[75]", "Nor, in my view, is the Applicant assisted by his attempts to invoke IRPA or the ICCPL. The Applicant has been legally deported back to China and is no longer subject to IRPA; and the ICCPL only applies to Canada with respect to \"individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction ...\" which the Applicant clearly is not. There is no evidence to suggest that the Applicant was not afforded his full rights under the ICCPL while he was within Canada's territory and jurisdiction. In any event, the Applicant claims that all he is asserting in this application is a right of reply to his letter from the government of Canada. I do not see how this alleged right engages IRPA, ICCPL, the Charter, or the Canadian constitution."], ["[76]", "In summary, the Applicant's failure to request the specific reply he wishes to have the Court order the government to now give him is itself sufficient grounds to refuse", "mandamus", ". In addition, the Applicant has established no Charter or constitutional violation by Canadian authorities, and Canada's decision to do anything about the Applicant's situation in China falls clearly within the Crown prerogative and none of the exceptions to non-interference by the Court (breach of Charter or constitution, breach of statute, or breach of legitimate expectations) have been established.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[77] THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "1. The application is dismissed.", "Application dismissed.", "Editor: Anick Ouellette-Levesque/vnh"]]}

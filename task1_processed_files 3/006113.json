Following his arrest on these charges, he was served with a Notice of Ascertained Forfeiture demanding payment in an amount equal to the deemed value of these goods (the \"Notice\"). According to the Act, Mr. Heron had 90 days from that date to object to the Notice. He did eventually file an objection to the Notice, but the lawyer he had instructed to do so missed the prescribed deadline by two days as he thought this deadline had to be calculated in months rather than in days.

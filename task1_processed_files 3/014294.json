This focuses on the statutory mechanism of review. A full privative clause is defined as \"one that declares that decisions of the tribunal are final and conclusive from which no appeal lies and all forms of judicial review are excluded.\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 216 N.R. 1; 158 Sask.R. 81; 153 W.A.C. 81; 149 D.L.R.(4th) 577, at para. 17;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 30).

Thus, it is a factor which militates in favour of some deference.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "2.", "Relative expertise.", "This factor recognizes that legislatures will sometimes remit an issue to a decision making body that has a particular topical expertise. The analysis under this factor has three aspects: the Court must characterize the expertise of the decision-maker in question; it must consider its own expertise relative to that of the decision-maker and it must identify the nature of the specific issue before the administrative decision-maker relative to this expertise.

Given that visa officers habitually evaluate visa applications such as the one at issue, it can be said that they have gained a measure of relative institutional expertise, a factor which suggests that their decisions should be shown more deference.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "3.", "Purpose of the statute", ". The objectives of the", "Act", "enumerated in s. 3(1) include \"permit[ting] Canada to pursue the maximum social, cultural and economic benefits of immigration\" and \"promoting the successful integration of permanent residents into Canada.\" The particular provision, s. 12(2), states that a \"[ ... ] [f]oreign national may be selected as a member of the economic class on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada.\" While the visa officer determination in question does not involve a polycentric balancing exercise, \"reviewing Courts should also consider the breadth, specialization, and technical or scientific nature of the issues that the legislation asks the administrative tribunal to consider\" and how that deviates from the normal role of courts in determining the level of deference warranted by this factor (", "Dr. Q.", ", supra, at para. 31).

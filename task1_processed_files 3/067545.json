On April 6, 2002, Mr. Mohinder Paul Singh was arrested a second time as militants from Kashmir, together with Sikhs militants, were lurking in the region. He was again tortured and subsequently released two days later, further to the help of influential individuals and after payment of a bribe. In the first week of October 2002, the police came to Mr. Mohinder Paul Singh's house, during which time he was absent. The police threatened his wife and ordered her to have him present himself to the police station. They alleged that Muslim and Sikh militants were planning attacks to bomb in Punjab and in New Delhi. The police suspected Mr. Mohinder Paul Singh of helping the militants transport weapons. Having been informed of his alleged, precarious situation, Mr. Mohinder Paul Singh, further to discussions with his family, decided to leave the Punjab.

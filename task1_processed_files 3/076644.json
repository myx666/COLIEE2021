In my view, this information referring to \"central crime register 1419/3/99\", without the production of the \"new\" warrant itself, does not establish that a second warrant was issued. The information in the e-mail and the fax at pages 323 and 324 respectively of the tribunal record was not sufficient to conclude that a second warrant existed. The panel concluded that the 1998 \"charges were dropped\" and the principal applicant's bail money was returned to him in February 1999.

In doing so, I note that the Respondent has correctly referred to Rule 38 as permitting the Court to proceed in the absence of a party if the Court is satisfied that notice of the hearing was given to that party in accordance with the Rules. I am satisfied that this requirement is met, as the Order dated June 30, 2015 granting leave in this matter and setting the hearing date was sent by facsimile on June 30 to the Applicant's then solicitor of record, which represents effective service upon the Applicant and therefore notice in accordance with the Rules.", "II.", "Background"], ["[4]", "The twenty-two year old Applicant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.

At paragraph 13, Justice Beaudry has this to say about such a determination:", "The Board erroneously determined the applicant's knowledge of the Catholic faith by way of \"trivia\". In assessing the applicant's knowledge of Christianity, the Board \"erroneously expected the answers of the applicant to questions about his religion to be equivalent to the Board's own knowledge of that religion\"", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED."], ["[23]", "On the other hand, the Respondent relies on the decision in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", ", in which Justice Gleason stated as follows at CITATION_SUPPRESSED:"], ["[55] Indeed, in all cases - and especially in cases like the present where the applicant's credibility is found to be wanting - the Court should not be too hasty to substitute its opinion for that of the RPD, which has developed expertise regarding the dictates of a number of religions. As Justice Near noted in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "(cited above at para 8), assessing the genuineness of the claimant's religious beliefs is a difficult task and \"this challenging job has been delegated to the Board as the finder of fact and this Court cannot, on judicial review, decide to, in effect, reweigh the results of what can look like a round of Bible trivia\" (at para 18). In my view, in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED, Justice Near set out the proper approach to be adopted by this Court in assessing the reasonableness of the RPD's assessment of the genuineness of a claimant's religious beliefs. After reviewing an awkward set of questions the Board had posed regarding what Jesus was like, he stated:", "... this line of questioning illustrates the difficulty of the assessment the Board is required to make. It does not represent an error for which the Board's decision should be over-turned. Absent a showing of disregard for the evidence, or a misapprehension of the facts, I am unwilling to disturb the Board's conclusion in this regard - again deference is warranted. The Board did not make the determination of the genuineness of the Applicant's faith based solely on the Applicant's inability to attribute some human characteristics to Jesus. Answers to other questions regarding the Pentecostal faith were vague and lacking in detail. As the Respondent submits, testimony lacking in detail that would reasonably be expected of a person in the claimant's position is a basis for rejecting claims as non-credible even if the Applicant was able to answer some other questions, and with great detail."], ["[24]", "Similarly, Justice Pinard held as follows in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED:"], ["[15]", "Amselem", ", above, deals with freedom of religion and the subjectivity of religious beliefs. Thus, the Supreme Court of Canada held that it is not the objectivity of the religious beliefs that matters, nor their validity, but rather the sincerity of the applicant's religious beliefs (at para 43). Here, the Board needed to assess the genuineness of the applicant's religious convictions. The questions asked by the Board were not to gage the correctness of his beliefs, but rather to determine whether the applicant understood the basic tenants of Christianity. Unlike in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, the Court was not assessing the sophistication of the applicant's belief: the Board did not accept that the applicant was a genuine Christian (at para 13). Moreover, Mr. Justice Russell Zinn in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "specifically stated that the sincerity of the applicant's religious conviction can be assessed with regards to his familiarity with the dogma or creed invoked (at para 17)."], ["[25]", "I believe that Justice Rennie succinctly captured the applicable principle at paragraph 9 of", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED:"], ["[9] The Board is tasked with assessing the applicant's credibility and not the soundness of his theology. A claimant may have a poor understanding of the minutiae of the religious doctrine but that does not, necessarily, mean his faith is not genuine. While there is a logical correlation between the depth of religious knowledge and the credibility of a claim of persecution, here, the deviations from doctrine were, at best, minor and cannot safely sustain the finding that the applicant was not a genuine adherent."], ["[26]", "My reading of the jurisprudence is that it is not improper for the Board to engage in religious questioning in an effort to gauge the genuineness of a claimant's beliefs, but that such questioning and resulting analysis must indeed focus on the genuineness of those beliefs and not whether they are theologically correct. This can be a difficult task for the Board, as it is entitled to consider whether the claimant holds a level of religious knowledge that would be expected of someone in the claimant's position but should not reach an adverse conclusion based on minutiae or holding the claimant to an unreasonably high standard of religious knowledge."], ["[27]", "My conclusion is that the Board approached this task in a defensible manner. The Board was neither subjecting him to a test on religious trivia nor reaching its conclusions based on an assessment of the theological soundness of his responses. Rather, it was posing relatively basic questions and, for the most part, based its conclusion as to the lack of genuinely held belief not upon an assessment of the correctness of the Applicant's answers but rather upon the Applicant's failure to provide answers or answers of any detail. The Board acknowledged that the Applicant provided some correct answers. However, its conclusion that he is not a genuine Christian, based on his lack of overall knowledge of the Christian religion, is reasonable and consistent with the jurisprudence."], ["[28]", "Turning to the Applicant's submissions on procedural fairness, I cannot conclude this argument to have merit. It cannot be unexpected for the Applicant to have to answer questions posed by the Board on the religion he professes to follow, so that the Board can assess the genuineness of his belief. Given my conclusion that this questioning and the resulting analysis were within the boundaries contemplated by the jurisprudence, I do not consider this to be reliance on specialized knowledge."], ["[29]", "Finally, I can find no fault in the Board`s finding under section 107(2) of IRPA that there was no credible basis for the Applicant's claim.

In my view, the Crown simply disagrees with the Prothonotary's conclusions on the evidence."], ["[104]", "First of all, the Crown says that there really were no pre-indicators of violence in this case. This was an argument that the Prothonotary specifically addresses in her reasons. She felt, indeed, that there were pre-indicators of violence:", "a. \"... there was animosity between Mr. Carr and his assailant immediately prior to the assault. Mr. Carr testified that the two exchanged profanities and that they bumped shoulders when the assailant tried to push in front of him in the line for the telephone.\"", "b. \"Officer Dustin Marshall testified that the profanities exchanged between Mr. Carr and the assailant ... may lead to violence if exchanged within a prison setting.\"", "c. \"Prison correctional officers are on alert for such verbal outbursts as indicators of potential violence.\"", "d. \"Officer Jugloff ... would likely have noticed a verbal altercation and physical contact in the telephone area ... .\"", "e. \"... the first incident in the telephone area was of sufficient loudness or otherwise noticeable for a correctional officer in S Control Module to have observed.\""], ["[105]", "In other words, notwithstanding what Mr. Carr thought and did himself following the altercation in the telephone area, the Prothonotary concluded that this \"current case is not a case where it was a random act of violence without warning: there is evidence of pre-indicators of violence.\""], ["[106]", "The loud exchange of profanities that followed the slight physical contact between the Plaintiff and his assailant is not, per se, a pre-indicator of violence. It all depends on the context, and the Prothonotary is careful to place those acts in the full context of this case:", "\"25. Officer Marshall stated in his testimony that turnover is high at MAU given that the average time an inmate stays is from four to six months. Unlike a regular prison where staff can get acquainted with the inmate population, the staff are often unable to identify which inmates are more violent. Officer Marshall agreed that while there are often verbal altercations that do not lead to violence, he also stated that in such a situation there is 'nothing you can do but be extra vigilant ... you just have to make sure that you are watching.'", "\"26. Furthermore, the static security measures in place were inadequate in providing a reasonable amount of protection for inmates. Use of the five telephones in the institution is limited because of their scarcity relative to the large prison population. There is a high demand to use these telephones, as evidenced by the fact that Mr. Carr waited in line for over an hour to use one. In a prison environment with inmates who have not yet been classified as warranting minimum, medium, or maximum security and governed by a prisoner hierarchy, it should have been obvious to CSC that having prisoners wait around for a telephone would create highly charged situations where tempers could flare up.", "\"27. The prison officials who testified did not seem to be completely clear on their approach to this area. Officer Dustin stated his preference for a 'one-in, one-out' rule with regard to the using the telephone area. In her testimony, however, Officer Crisp stated that the prison has nothing to do with establishing the procedure for using the telephones and in effect, the inmates regulate priority of access to the telephones among themselves. She stated that there is no 'one in, one out' rule whereby inmates are only let into the telephone area if there is a telephone free for them to use. Instead, she suggested that inmates might obtain priority access to the telephones solely based on their position in the hierarchy of the inmate population.", "\"28. Officer Crisp also testified that CSC is ultimately unable to control the number of offenders who go into the telephone area. This lack of control is exacerbated by the fact that the correctional officer in the S Control Module must turn his or her back on the entrance to the telephone area in order to press the button to open and close the barrier. In so doing, the officer is unable to adequately monitor how many people enter the telephone room at any one time. If more people enter than there are available telephones, there is the potential for conflict given the high demand for telephones and lack of surveillance. This absence of consistent or set policies or procedures for telephone use in combination with the lack of adequate surveillance of the telephone area is a breach of the duty of care.", "\"29. The lack of camera surveillance is also an indication of inadequate precautions. At the time of the first incident between the two inmates in the telephone area, there was no surveillance camera. Moreover, while there are cameras in the area of the assault, not all cameras would broadcast to the observation gallery since there are only three monitors for four cameras. Adequate security would warrant that an operating camera would broadcast events in the area where the assault took place to the observation gallery so as to keep correctional officers informed of potential problems.", "\"30. Furthermore, what is recorded is only that which is shown on the monitor that a correctional officer in the observation gallery is actually viewing. Thus, in this case, there is no direct recording of the initial altercation or the assault to aid in identifying the assailant or what actually occurred. These inadequate static security features made it incumbent on the CSC to watch for situations of potential conflict, whether reported or not. This inability to monitor key areas where inmates are able to move freely in this highly charged environment is also a breach of the duty of care.", "\"31. I find that CSC breached its duty of care when it failed to take reasonable steps, in light of pre-indicators of violence, in both its static and dynamic security to prevent the assault on Mr. Carr.\""], ["[107]", "It is clear that there was no direct evidence that the pre-indicators were observed. Officer Jugloff did not testify:", "\"22. Both Officer Crisp and Officer Marshall agreed that the correctional officer stationed at the S Control Module, Officer Bill Jugloff, had the best vantage point to observe the verbal altercation and bumping of shoulders between Mr. Carr and the assailant in the telephone area. There was no affidavit by Officer Jugloff submitted into court; nor was the report that he had written about the incident. As well, CSC did not call Officer Jugloff to testify. Officer Crisp only read Officer Jugloff's report but did not interview him. Without the benefit of evidence from Officer Jugloff, who would likely have noticed a verbal altercation and physical contact in the telephone area, I must give weight to Mr. Carr's testimony that the first incident in the telephone area was of sufficient loudness or otherwise noticeable for a correctional officer in S Control Module to have observed.\""], ["[108]", "The Crown alleges that Prothonotary Milczynski relied upon an adverse inference (the failure to call Officer Jugloff) \"to find the awareness required of the defendant at a pre-indicator of violence to establish a breach of the duty of care.\" However, this is clearly not the case."], ["[109]", "Prothonotary Milczynski relies upon Mr. Carr's testimony as the basis for her conclusion \"that the first incident in the telephone area was of sufficient loudness or otherwise noticeable for a correctional officer in S Control Module to have observed.\" Without evidence from Officer Jugloff, Mr. Carr's evidence of what happened in the telephone area was the only direct evidence she had before her on the altercation, and whether it was observable or ought, reasonably, to have been observed."], ["[110]", "It is, of course, possible to disagree with Prothonotary Milczynski's findings on this crucial issue of the presence of pre-indicators of violence.

No one knows for sure what Officer Jugloff may have seen, or ought to have seen of the altercation. No one knows for sure what was observable and audible in S Control Module at the time of the altercation. Prothonotary Milczynski had to assess whether, given Mr. Carr's own evidence about the altercation and the context gleaned from other witnesses, whether a pre-indication of violence occurred in this case. The evidence on this point was certainly not conclusive. It is also possible to take exception to the Prothonotary's findings, as the Crown has done, based upon other factors relevant to the full context. But was this a palpable and overriding error? I cannot say it was."], ["[111]", "It is also evident from the Decision that the lack of surveillance in the telephone area was only \"an indication of inadequate precautions.\" It was simply part of the whole context that Prothonotary Milczynski examined to decide whether there had been a breach of CSC's duty to take reasonable care regarding Mr. Carr's safety. The static security features come into play in two ways in the Decision:", "a. \"These inadequate static security features made it incumbent on the CSC to watch for situations of potential conflict, whether reported or not\"; and", "b. \"This inability to monitor key areas where inmates are able to move freely in this highly charged environment is also a breach of the duty of care.\""], ["[112]", "It is important to note that what Prothonotary Milczynski means by \"static security features\" is not just camera surveillance.

In the end, the Crown is simply disagreeing with the factors chosen by the Prothonotary as relevant to the general discussion concerning the breach of duty issue and the weight which she gave to those factors. This disagreement does not, in my view, amount to proof of a palpable and overriding error in the Decision.", "Causation"], ["[132]", "The Crown's final point is that the Prothonotary erred in finding that the Plaintiff had discharged his burden of proving the Defendant caused his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder."], ["[133]", "The arguments raised by the Crown on this causation issue were raised with Prothonotary Milczynski and she dealt with them in a full and forthright way in her Decision:", "\"35. At trial, CSC suggested there was no proof for Mr. Carr's claim of 'on-going pain and suffering as a result of the assault', or a claim for PTSD as a result of the assault. CSC pointed to three areas that negated Mr. Carr's claims. One, CSC argued that Mr. Carr had not consulted with the mental health professionals for PTSD specifically. Two, that there was a lack of a formal diagnosis of PTSD according to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV). Three, that previous traumas in Mr. Carr's life were the cause for the symptoms that he claimed were PTSD and that it would be too difficult to differentiate the cause of these symptoms for the purposes of assessing damages. I reject these arguments.", "\"36. First, despite Mr. Carr being referred to all three mental health professionals for different purposes, the impact of the assault was a central issue that came up in each interview with Mr. Carr. Dr. Cheston examined Mr. Carr to evaluate the likelihood of recidivism and to conduct other evaluations consistent with release from penitentiary. Dr. Epelbaum was following up on Mr. Carr's post-release medication use, which was initially prescribed following the assault. Despite the different purposes for the interviews with Dr. Epelbaum and Dr. Cheston, it is significant that the impact of the assault featured prominently and the need to address the presenting symptoms of PTSD. These considerations support the legitimacy of Mr. Carr's PTSD claims because it is realistic for his symptoms of PTSD to exist among many differing concerns and challenges.", "\"37. Dr. Cassels was specifically seen by Mr. Carr because of the difficulties he was having after the assault. His comments demonstrate the detrimental impact the assault was having on Mr. Carr's ability to function daily in the prison community:", "'[...] When we started counseling with Mr. Carr, his sleeping was severely disrupted. He was experiencing nightmares, flashbacks and those sorts of things. Other than working out and going for some meals, he was virtually doing nothing but hiding out in his cell and occupying himself with activities that would just help him escape from the day-to-day, humdrum situation, and any memories he might have had of the events at Millhaven.'", "\"38. Yet, CSC contended that the lack of a formal diagnosis of PTSD and insufficient evidence that treatment was oriented to the on-going pain and suffering from the assault meant that the Mr. Carr's claims were unfounded. I have difficulty with this argument. The expectation that evidence of mental illness comes to the courtroom without co morbid factors (which will be discussed below), and with a clean and unqualified rigid diagnosis is not realistic or fair to claimants. The three mental health professionals were convincing that a less than formal approach does not in any way suggest that their findings of PTSD are incorrect.", "\"39. Second, in any case, that there was a lack of formal diagnosis of PTSD is not evident. CSC contended that the lack of an investigation for malingering was a crucial element of a PTSD diagnosis that Dr. Epelbaum failed to perform. I accept, however, Dr. Epelbaum's expert testimony that the fact that the assault happened satisfied him that the claims relating to PTSD were legitimate. Dr. Epelbaum made his diagnosis of PTSD on the basis of his clinical interview with Mr. Carr. Furthermore, the symptoms of Mr. Carr and their improvement with treatment are in keeping with the normal diminishing over time of symptoms associated with chronic PTSD. Mr. Carr's gradual improvement is shown by the fact that he was prescribed medication in the aftermath of the assault, but Dr. Epelbaum felt that Mr. Carr's improved ability to cope with the PTSD was sufficient enough as to merit trying to discontinue medication.", "\"40. Finally, CSC argued that Mr. Carr's anxiety symptoms may have partially been the result of previous traumas and incidents This argument suggests that claimants with previous traumas and mental illness could be precluded from damages related to PTSD because the differentiation of symptoms is difficult. This is an undesirable outcome. Symptoms must be differentiated to the best of the court's ability. Additionally, there were symptoms of Mr. Carr's that could easily be attributed directly to the assault, such as, the nightmares, the flashbacks, the anxiety of being in large crowds and the inability to cope generally day to day following the assault.", "\"41. The Supreme Court of Canada in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Beverly McLachlin stated at paragraphs 78-81:", "'It is important to distinguish between causation as the source of the loss and the rules of damage assessment in tort. The rules of causation consider generally whether \"but for\" the defendant's acts, the plaintiff's damages would have been incurred on a balance of probabilities. Even though there may be several tortuous and non-tortious causes of injury, so long as the defendant's act is a cause of the plaintiff's damage, the defendant's is fully liable for that damage. The rules of damages then consider what the original position of the Plaintiff would have been. The governing principle is that the defendant need not put the plaintiff in a better position than his original position and should not compensate the plaintiff for any damages he would have suffered anyway: Athey.", ". . . . .", "'At the same time, the defendant takes his victim as he finds him - the thin skull rule.'", ". . . . .", "\"42. Mr. Carr has a history of traumas and related anxieties pre-dating the assault. The thin skull rule normally means that a defendant will have to compensate more in damages where an individual or group was impacted more seriously because of their pre-existing vulnerability. Despite the psychologically difficult prison environment, Mr. Carr responded to treatment and learned better coping mechanisms that will hopefully assist him in the future. The intent of a damages award is to return a plaintiff to the position had the assault never occurred. In Mr. Carr's case, his treatment seems to have been quite effective to help reaching this goal so that Dr. Epelbaum, almost two years later, found the elements of PTSD to be mild.", "\"43. Mr. Carr has not shown that his past traumas impeded his recovery. To his credit, he appears to have used the difficulties from the assault as an opportunity to learn more positive responses to challenges in his life. This does not suggest that earlier traumas did not make the period after the assault particularly painful and difficult. Even though it was clear that Mr. Carr needed mental health assistance as soon as possible following such a terrifying event, Mr. Carr did not see a mental health professional until two months following the assault. There is no mention of his emotional state in the CSC medical report following the assault despite the psychological impact being more detrimental and devastating than the physical scars. CSC contributed to further damages when they were not alive to the possibility that Mr. Carr would experience PTSD symptoms that needed immediate assistance.\""], ["[134]", "I have reviewed the evidence in question together with the objections raised by the Crown. As with the other issues raised by the Crown in this appeal, I can certainly see that it is possible to take issue with the Prothonotary's approach and her conclusions.

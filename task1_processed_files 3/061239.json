The Parties' Submissions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "Counsel for Gao presented two related lines of argument. The first is that Gao was denied procedural fairness in the decision-making process of immigration officials, as defined by the Supreme Court of Canada (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 671; 78 C.L.L.C. 14,181;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.C.C.(2d) 353; 106 D.L.R. (3d) 385; 13 C.R.(3d) 1), and by the Federal Court of Appeal (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "According to this argument, the \"positive\" 1990 Glendale report negated the 1988 Medical Notification. Thus, if the decision of the Immigration Officer was based on the 1988 Medical Notification, Gao was entitled to be advised of that fact and to be allowed to adduce the subsequent positive Glendale report. If the decision was based on a negative assessment of the Glendale report, Gao was entitled to be advised of the reasons for the negative assessment and for the conclusion that Qi's needs would place excessive demands on health and social services.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "In short, the Immigration Officer owed a duty of fairness to consider all relevant reports, to inform Gao of a negative assessment and to provide him an opportunity to counter it. Gao was entitled to expect, particularly in the wake of the March 1991 letter, that he would be informed of further developments and would have the opportunity to present his case, if necessary, before the final decision was made. Moreover, 16 months had elapsed between the Glendale report and the inadmissibility decision, with no intervening request by the Immigration Officer for further examination of Qi.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "The Immigration Officer's decision gave no indication as to the grounds for its conclusion. HW's purported M5 assessment of December 1990 was inconsistent with the assessments of M7 and T5 included in the 1988 Medical Notification. The M5 assessment states that future admission to Canada could be considered because of the \"expected response to treatment\". On the other hand, the T5 and M7 assessments imply that no treatment was available or likely to succeed and that the finding of inadmissibility was final. Thus, the effect of the Immigration Officer's decision was to downgrade Qi from M5 to M7 without justification or explanation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "Gao's second argument is that the Immigration Officer's decision was patently unreasonable, on the ground that, although the positive Glendale assessment had been undertaken at the request of HW for immigration purposes, no second medical opinion had been issued since the January 1988 Medical Notification. The Glendale report did not support the medical profile on that Medical Notification, the HW assessment was inconsistent with the medical profile on that Medical Notification, and thus the medical evidence was conflicting and contradictory.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "Further, there was no evidence that the Immigration Officer had given separate consideration to the Glendale report. The only evidence before the court was Dr. Ferrari's letter indicating HW had considered the report. Even if the court accepted that letter as evidence that HW had considered the Glendale report, the letter was not a medical opinion under the", "Act", ", it contradicted the 1988 Medical Notification, and gave no indication that the factors enumerated under s. 22 of the", "Regulations", "were taken into account in arriving at the M5 assessment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "According to", "Immigration Manual", "procedures, the medical officers assessing the Glendale report had to consider each s. 22 factor and to indicate what Qi's new medical profile was under the M5 overall assessment. There was thus no evidence before the Immigration Officer to support the view that Qi would place \"excessive demands\" on health or social services, as required for a finding of inadmissibility under s. 19(1)(a)(ii). In addition it was, still according to counsel, not only unfair but unreasonable for the Immigration Officer to have, in effect, downgraded Qi from M5 to M7.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "Naturally, counsel for the Minister did not accept these two arguments. With respect to procedural fairness, she claimed the process leading to the December 1991 decision was fair: the 1988 opinion was reasonable in light of the available material and the 1990 Glendale report confirmed the 1988 diagnosis. She emphasized that Gao had not been denied an opportunity to make representations in Qi's behalf, but had simply never asked to be heard. He had inquired only about the results of HW's assessment of the Glendale report. Gao had been aware of Qi's condition, of the 1988 Medical Notification, of the 1990 Glendale report, and of the possibility that Qi's condition might have a negative impact on the family's chances for admission to Canada. He could have made representations had he wished to.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "She also submitted that the court ought not to interfere with a medical diagnosis. The 1988 Medical Notification was valid in law, and it was not patently unreasonable for the Immigration Officer to have relied on it. The", "Immigration Manual", "is not law, and the Minister was under no legal obligation to produce a second Medical Notification following the Glendale report. The Glendale report did not annihilate the 1988 Medical Notification: it expressed concern that Qi would continue to need some assistance and it was not patently unreasonable to conclude that this constituted excessive demands on social services. There was no evidence that s. 22 factors had not been taken into account. In addition, the Immigration Officer was not obliged to provide reasons for the decision of inadmissibility. Finally, that decision did not prevent Gao from seeking to stay in Canada by some other means, nor did it preempt other recourses available to him.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "Counsel for the Minister concluded Gao had not met the burden of proof of demonstrating that the Immigration Officer had committed a reviewable error.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "5. Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[32]", "Most of the case law relating to medical inadmissibility decisions by visa or Immigration Officers has issued from appellate bodies (from the former Immigration Appeal Board, the current Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board, and, on appeal from decisions of those two bodies, from the Federal Court of Appeal). The general principles arising from these cases are of course relevant to a judicial review application seeking to quash an Immigration Officer's decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[33]", "The governing principle arising from this body of jurisprudence is that reviewing or appellate courts are not competent to make findings of fact related to the medical diagnosis, but are competent to review the evidence to determine whether the medical officers' opinion is reasonable in the circumstances of the case (", "Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). The reasonableness of a medical opinion is to be assessed not only as of the time it was given, but also as of the time it was relied upon by the Immigration Officer, since it is that decision which is being reviewed or appealed (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). The grounds of unreasonableness include incoherence or inconsistency (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  evidence (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , note 12,", "Le", ", supra,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  stipulated in s. 22 of the", "Regulations", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , note 12)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[34]", "Applying these considerations to the case at bar, I find that the medical opinion of January 1988 was unreasonable at the time it was relied on by the Immigration Officer in December 1991, and that the Immigration Officer's decision of Qi's inadmissibility based on that opinion was patently unreasonable. It is apparent, from the March 1991 letter to Gao, that immigration officials were awaiting HW's assessment of the Glendale report in order to arrive at a decision. When it was received in November 1991, HW's M5 assessment was inconsistent with the M7 assessment of 1988. It most certainly was not a \"confirmation\" of it as submitted on behalf of the Minister. Thus, the decision of inadmissibility was made despite the contradictory HW assessment based on the more recent Glendale report which indicated the January 1988 Medical Notification was, in fact, no longer reasonable (as Gao's counsel pointed out, the M5 assessment is also inconsistent with the T5 notation appearing on the January 1988 notification).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[35]", "This contradictory information should, in my view, have alerted the officer to the need for further investigation. He or she should at least have called for an updated examination of Qi and a full second medical opinion that would take into account all the factors specified under s. 22 of the", "Regulations", ".

His last information was the rather hopeful Glendale report, followed by the March 1991 letter from immigration to the effect that \"we hope to be contacting you soon with more information\". Then came the December 1991 decision finding the applicant inadmissible.

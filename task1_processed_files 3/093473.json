All of these actions arise out of what is known as conflict proceedings in the Canadian Patent Office. The Canadian", "Patent Act", ", R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4 underwent substantial amendments effective October 1, 1989, wherein applications for patents filed before that date are treated in a significantly different manner than those filed after that date. One of the most significant amendments was a change from \"first to invent\" under the pre-October 1, 1989 regime to a \"first to file\" regime after that date. The first to invent regime is in many respects similar to that which prevailed and to some extent still prevails in the United States, whereas the first to file regime resembles a regime followed in Europe and many other countries."], ["[3]", "Conflict proceedings such as these actions are governed by section 43 of the pre-October 1, 1989", "Patent Act", "and were the subject of a special Rule, Rule 701, in this Court. That Rule no longer exists as conflict actions are now rare. I am advised that very few, perhaps a dozen or two, applications for a patent filed in the Canadian Patent Office before October 1, 1989, still are in processing in the Patent Office. Those applications and the contents of the prosecution files, unlike the post October 1, 1989 applications, are not open to the public. Entitlement to a patent, where it appears to the Patent Office that two or more patent applications are directed to the same subject matter (something that occurs more often than one might think) are determined by the Commissioner of Patents by reviewing affidavits submitted by the competing parties directed to the date or the dates when the invention was made by their inventors. Parties who are unsatisfied with that determination may proceed to request a new determination by way of an action filed in this Court. These three actions are examples in which there was a determination by the Commissioner as to who was the first to invent the subject matter of certain claims, the dissatisfied parties seek a re-determination in this Court."], ["[4]", "Under the post October 1, 1989 regime a patent is awarded to the first party to file an application regardless of the date of invention."], ["[5]", "When an action, such as these, is filed, a party knows only what is in its own file in the Patent Office, the file of the other parties is not of public record. Once pleadings are complete and discovery begins, each party gains access, usually on a confidential basis, to the patent application files of the other parties. Thus it is not unexpected that some of the parties may seek to amend their pleadings, as is the situation here."], ["[6]", "The present amendment sought by each of Monsanto and Mycogen deal with a submission made by patent agents acting for Bayer to the Canadian Patent Office during the course of prosecuting its patent application involved in those conflict proceedings. In a response to an office action, Bayer's agents drew the patent examiner's attention to certain statements made in an affidavit of Jansens filed with the United States Patent Office in the course of prosecuting an application there. A copy of that affidavit was submitted to the patent examiner."], ["[7]", "In proceedings before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  addressed the same Jansens affidavit in respect of a Bayer patent similar to the Bayer Canadian application and made findings, including these at page 40 of these reasons that Bayer committed inequitable conduct in submitting a knowingly false Jansens' declaration, and failing to disclose to the United States Patent Office known negative results that would have refuted Bayer's claims, the patent was declared to be unenforceable."], ["[8]", "The amendments now proposed by Monsanto and Mycogen arise, therefore, from the submissions by Bayer to the Canadian Patent Office of the same Jansens affidavit. Bayer vigorously opposes the proposed amendments."], ["[9]", "In general the Court will allow amendments to pleadings provided such amendments will not result in an injustice to the opposite party that cannot be compensated in costs and that it would serve the interests of justice.

Bayer rests its argument on the sole basis that the amendments sought do not raise an issue that can properly be determined in the context of the present actions. In so doing Bayer's counsel refers to the reasons of the Federal Court of Appeal in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Isaac CJ for the Court at page 24:", "In determining whether an amendment to a defence should be allowed, it is often helpful for the Court to ask itself whether the amendment, if it was already part of the proposed pleadings, would be a plea capable of being struck out under Rule 419. If yes, the amendment should not be allowed. See, for example,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). Procedurally, the Court will not receive any evidence where the basis for striking out paragraphs in a statement of defence is alleged to be that they disclose no reasonable defence (Rule 419(1)(a)). Rule 419(2) expressly prohibits the use of evidence on a Rule 419(1)(a) motion. In similar fashion, the Court should not accept any evidence in support of an application for leave to amend pleadings under Rule 420, unless evidence is required in order to clarify the nature of the proposed amendments. Rather, the Court must assume that the facts pleaded in the amendments are true for the purposes of considering whether or not to grant leave to amend."], ["[11]", "All Counsel, including Bayer's Counsel, accept that, as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 980, on a motion such as these the facts as set out in the proposed amendments are to be taken as proved and that, in order to succeed, it must be shown by the party resisting the amendment that it is plain and obvious that the amendment sought cannot succeed. To that I would add that the Supreme Court also said that the length and complexity of the issues and the novelty of what is pleaded should not be a bar. I repeat what Wilson J. for the Court wrote at page 980:", "Thus, the test in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court is the same as the one that governs an application under R.S.C. O. 18, r. 19: assuming that the facts as stated in the statement of claim can be proved, is it \"plain and obvious\" that the plaintiff's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action? As in England, if there is a change that the plaintiff might succeed, then the plaintiff should not be \"driven from the judgment seat\". Neither the length and complexity of the issues, the novelty of the cause of action, nor the potential for the defendant to present a strong defence should prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with his or her case. Only if the action is certain to fail because it contains a radical defect ranking with the others listed in Rule 19(24) of the British Columbia Rules of Court should the relevant portions of a plaintiff's statement of claim be struck out under Rule 19(24)(a)."], ["[12]", "Put succinctly, the amendments sought are based on some kind of concept of lack of candour or bad faith on the part of Bayer during the prosecution of its application at issue in submitting the Jansens affidavit. I hasten to add that Jansens is not named by Bayer as an inventor and that affidavit was not submitted in response to a request for affidavits to support a date of invention rather, the affidavit was submitted as part of a response to an Office action so as to argue for broader claims."], ["[13]", "Bayer's counsel argued that there is no statutory basis which would call for a duty of candour on behalf of an applicant for a patent, nor is there any statutory penalties provided for lack of candour. Further, Bayer's counsel argues that there is no common law or other non-statutory duty of candour nor penalties for lack of candour. Thus, says Bayer's counsel, even if one assumes that the allegations made in the amendments are true, which Bayer must accept for the purpose of the motion but not otherwise, there are no consequences and no relief can be claimed by Monsanto or Mycogen as a result."], ["[14]", "Counsel for each of Monsanto and Mycogen argue that, while they do not rely on section 73 of the post October 1, 1989", "Patent Act", "(dealing with the effect of changes to the Act) nor section 53 (dealing only with what is set out in the petition for the patent and the specification) there are at least common law provisions and section 30 of the", "Act", "which provides a basis for the relief claimed."], ["[15]", "I am satisfied that the state of the law respecting conflict proceedings in general and the duty of candour in respect of submissions to the Patent Office is sufficiently in a state of flux and is not so certain and to make it \"plain and obvious\" that the allegations put forward in the proposed amendments cannot succeed."], ["[16]", "With respect to conflict proceedings Justice Snider of this Court in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 403 wrote that conflict proceedings are directed to issues of priority of inventorship, and later proceedings dealing with a patent issued after the resolution of the conflict proceedings may deal with other issues. This does not mean, however, that in the course of conflict proceedings, the parties to those proceeding cannot raise issues as to why an opposite party should not get a patent in the first place. For instance, section 43(4) of the pre-October 1, 1989", "Patent Act", "permits a party to a conflict to submit prior art which it may allege anticipates a claim or claims in conflict."], ["[17]", "I addressed the question of a duty of candour upon an applicant for a patent in dealing with the Patent Office in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , reversed on other grounds, [2008] 1 F.C.R. 529.

An application for a patent is effectively an ex parte proceeding, only the applicant and the Patent Office examiner are involved in dialogue. The patent, when issued, is afforded a presumption of validity by the Patent Act.", "73 A patent is not issued simply to afford a member of the public an opportunity to challenge its validity (see e.g. by way of analogy to revenue legislation  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 54). An obligation arises on those seeking to gain a patent to act in good faith when dealing with the Patent Office. The application for the patent includes a specification and draft claims. The specification is the disclosure for which the monopoly defined by the claims is granted. This disclosure, as the Supreme Court has said, should be full, frank and fair. Further disclosure made in dialogue with the Patent Office examiner. Since at least October 1, 1996, communications with the examiner must be made in good faith. It is to be expected that there will be full, frank and fair disclosure. There is afforded during the prosecution ample opportunity to make further disclosure or to correct an earlier misstatement or shortcoming.

While a duty of candour and good faith exists during the prosecution of patent applications in the United States Patent Office, a similar duty does not exist in Canada. The facts alleged by Apotex in its NOA are addressed by subsection 30(1) of the Patent Act and paragraphs 40(l)(a), 40(1)(c) and section 45 of the Patent Rules. There is no basis in Canadian law for the separate allegation of breach of candour put forth by Apotex. As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  jurisprudence already require.

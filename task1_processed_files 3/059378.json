The Officer was concerned about the Applicant's inability to read English, as she scored zero points for reading on her International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam. The Officer was also concerned that the Applicant's lack of teaching experience in English or outside Iran would make it very difficult for her to find employment as a university professor in Canada. The Officer was also concerned about the Applicant's ability to find work in graphic design, as it is a very competitive field and the Applicant's experience was gained over 10 years ago and in an environment very different from Canada. The Applicant was not called in for an interview, and was given 45 days to submit further information to address the Officer's concerns."], ["[4]", "In response, the Applicant sent in submissions and documentation that she thought would address the concerns. She explained that she had not pursued a PhD because there was no such program in Iran, and that she had been managing the visual arts department at her university for two and a half years. The Applicant authored a book called \"Application of Graphics in Cartography\" in 2007, and has written many articles in her field. The Applicant also has significant research experience, and has used both field research and library research in her works."], ["[5]", "The Applicant helped to found a visual arts journal, and is on its editorial board. She has been working as a university professor for more than ten years, teaching courses that are similar to ones offered in Canada. The Applicant also has experience using a variety of computer design programs, and in designing sales catalogues and advertisements. She is a member of the Iranian Graphic Designer Society, which is a recognized member of the International Council of Graphic Design Associations. This means that the experience the Applicant has gained through the Iranian Graphic Designer Society meets most international standards."], ["[6]", "As regards to her language skills, the Applicant submitted that she has been attending English classes over the past year, and that her former test scores no longer reflect her language abilities. She told the Officer that she would be able to provide updated test scores if she could have more than 45 days to do so, as it takes longer than that to register and take the test. The Applicant explained that she had no reason to take the test earlier, as she did not think she needed any additional points to get into Canada since she was already over the threshold. The reason the Applicant was working on her English was to get ready to move to Canada."], ["[7]", "Because the Applicant could not get new test scores to the Officer in time, she provided the Officer with a letter from her English instructor. The instructor said that he expected the Applicant would have a very high level of conversational English by the end of the term. The Applicant finished her third level (advanced level) on 10 October 2012, and the instructor said that he expected the Applicant would get at least IELTS 6.5 if she took the IELTS exam again. The Applicant indicated that she had every intention of continuing to work on her English skills until she achieves a score of 7 on the exam, which is what is necessary to attend graduate schools in Canada."], ["[8]", "The Applicant's brother has indicated that he will provide her with employment at his Swiss Chalet franchise or his dry cleaning store if she is not able to obtain employment or pursue further studies when she first arrives in Canada. The Applicant says in her affidavit that her brother did not indicate the kind of work the Applicant would be doing at the Swiss Chalet restaurant because he believed it was obvious from the Applicant's background that she would be working on graphic design projects. The Swiss Chalet is a bigger business that requires more promotion than the dry cleaning store, so the Applicant's brother did not include a letter from the dry cleaning store."], ["[9]", "The Applicant explains in her affidavit that her husband is an experienced interior designer, and the Applicant's brother is also willing to offer employment to the Applicant and her husband to redo the interior of the dry cleaning store. The Applicant's husband also has a job offer from Daryoush Firouzli Architecture Inc., which is located in British Colombia.

The Officer found two of her publications referenced on the internet, but only in Farsi."], ["[14]", "In the entry dated 7 May 2012, the Officer pointed out that the Applicant obtained a score of 5 on her IELTS English test, meaning basic competence in the language, but she scored a 0 for reading. The Officer stated that her inability to read English would be a crucial obstacle for someone hoping to work in a field so dependant on written communication. With no academic experience outside of Iran or in English, the Officer thought it unlikely that she would be able to obtain a university teaching position or a comparable job in Canada."], ["[15]", "The Officer pointed out that the Applicant's other work experience is as a graphic designer. This is an economically difficult field for all but the very best, and the Officer noted that the Applicant's experience was obtained over 10 years ago and in an environment very different than Canada.

Just because there are no PhD programs available in Iran does not change the fact that such a qualification would be required for the Applicant to obtain work in Canada. The Officer also stated that the scholarly article written by the Applicant did not appear similar to what is found in most scholarly journals, as it was written in general language. The Officer noted that the Applicant had been improving her English language skills, but he did not think it was credible that she would wait to take the IELTS test again, considering she said she wished to pursue a PhD in Canada."], ["[17]", "The Officer stated that, after considering the Applicant's submissions, the concerns discussed in the procedural fairness letter remained. In addition, although the Applicant's brother provided a letter saying he would employ her at his Swiss Chalet restaurant, the letter did not say whether this would be in a skilled position. Given the Applicant's lack of experience in the restaurant industry, the Officer thought this unlikely, and the Applicant's working in an unskilled position cannot be considered as establishing economically in Canada as a skilled worker.

In general, she did not dispute the officer's assessment that, as things stood, she would not be able to establish economically in Canada as a University Professor. Her approach was to try and demonstrate that, if she came to Canada, she would eventually be able to qualify herself sufficiently to become a University Professor. She answered the specific concerns raised in the Fairness Letter in the following ways:", "a. The reason she does not have a PhD is that Islamic Azad University does not offer doctoral programs in visual arts and there are \"very few opportunities for and very limited grounds for academic progress in the field of visual arts in Iran.\" The Applicant has looked at neighbouring countries such as Armenia, but there are \"no doctoral degree programs available in graphics\";", "b. In order to remedy the PhD deficiency she proposes \"to work as an assistant professor in a country like Canada and also I am very enthusiastic to continue my studies at the doctoral level\";", "c.

She makes no attempt to address the concern that she has only worked in Farsi at a single university in Iran and has no international experience. The additional experience she cites is her attendance at the \"limited fairs and seminars in Iran\";", "e.

I have made this evaluation for the same reasons explained in the procedural fairness letter. In addition, although you provided a letter from your brother, stating that he will employ you at his Swiss Chalet restaurant, he has not indicated whether this would be in a skilled position (NOC level O, A or B). With your lack of prior experience in the restaurant industry, it is unlikely that he would employ you in a skilled position.

Hence, the only way the Applicant could know that her brother's support needed to be in the form of a skilled position would be if the governing legislation and jurisprudence require this. The purpose of the brother's support, as his letter makes clear, is to \"guarantee employment for my sister and her husband for the first two years in Canada, or, until they are settled in their field of work. \" This letter is clearly not intended to guarantee skilled employment but it does promise the necessary economic support to the Applicant and her spouse until they achieve their professional goals in Canada. In the end, the Officer does not address the issue of whether the Applicant's demonstrable economical viability in Canada is required to be as a skilled worker. The Officer simply assumes that this is a requirement. If it is not, then there is a fundamental error with the Decision.

This is simply not credible, considering her intent of wanting to pursue a PhD level once in Canada\" - is not material to the final decision on Negative Substituted Evaluation which, in so far as the Applicant's language abilities are concerned, is based upon \"no new IELTS result submitted\" and \"it is unlikely that PA will be able to secure skilled employment with such a low proficiency in reading English.\" The Officer notes that \"PA states has continued English studies with a private tutor ...\" There is no indication that this is not believed by the Officer who makes the final Decision."], ["[74]", "The Applicant further complains that she also \"indicated a willingness to officially demonstrate her improvement by signing up for an official language test if given the appropriate amount of time to do so.\" As noted, I see no request for a formal extension of time; the Applicant asserts her improved efficiency and supports this with a letter from her tutor.", "Unreasonableness"], ["[75]", "The Applicant says that the Officer failed to consider her on-going language training.

In my view, there is nothing unreasonable in the Officer requiring the usual proof of language efficiency, and the Applicant did not formally ask for further time to take the test and submit new scores."], ["[76]", "The Applicant also says that the Officer failed to consider her adaptability. The Applicant's basic response to the concerns and the Fairness Letter was not to dispute the initial assessment that she would not, at the time of her application, be able to achieve economic self-sufficiency in Canada as a University Professor, notwithstanding that she had scored 70 points. Her approach was to point out why she was not in such a position, and to suggest that the deficiencies could be remedied if she was allowed to come to Canada and take further education. There is no suggestion that she lacked the financial and family support to engage in the further education and experience required to achieve her goals."], ["[77]", "This brings up the issue of the relationship between the point system and economic self-sufficiency. The Applicant says that, in order to meet the requirements necessary to come to Canada pursuant to the skilled worker class, she must meet the points requirements set out in paragraph 85(3)(b) of the Regulations and demonstrate that she can become economically established in Canada. That is, that she can become economically self-sufficient within a reasonable amount of time upon her arrival in Canada. Given that the Applicant has already surpassed the points requirement by three points in this case, she says that the only issue is whether or not there is an additional requirement that she be able to establish herself economically in the occupation in which she qualified."], ["[78]", "It is clear that both the Act and the Regulations state that the Applicant must have the ability to become economically established in Canada in order to meet the requirements to enter Canada as a skilled worker.

(1) Pour l'application du paragraphe 12(2) de la Loi, la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) est une catégorie réglementaire de personnes qui peuvent devenir résidents permanents du fait de leur capacité à réussir leur établissement économique au Canada, qui sont des travailleurs qualifiés et qui cherchent à s'établir dans une province autre que le Québec."], ["[80]", "Hence, I have to agree with the Applicant that neither the Act nor the Regulations specify that an individual must become economically established in the occupational category that allows them to qualify as a skilled worker, or as the Officer appears to have assumed in this case that, even if the Applicant could not immediately become a University Professor, she was still obliged to demonstrate immediate economic self-sufficiency as a \"skilled worker.\""], ["[81]", "Parliament appears to have conceived of a skilled worker differently, for example, from an individual who applies pursuant to the entrepreneurship class who must demonstrate that they meet the requirements of the class for a period of one year within a three-year period after the day on which they become a permanent resident in Canada. As the Applicant points out, the Act and Regulations set out specific reporting requirements in this regard. In contrast, there appear to be no requirements that a skilled worker applicant has to meet upon their arrival in Canada and there is nothing which says they must immediately demonstrate economic self-sufficiency by only engaging in skilled work."], ["[82]", "I also agree with the Applicant that the Court has not found the legislation to contain a requirement that the person become economically self-sufficient in their qualifying occupation, or that a person has to join and participate in the labor market in a particular occupation when they arrive in Canada.

As Justice Evans points out in", "Dogra", "\"immigration policy is placing increasing emphasis on Applicants' adaptability and flexibility\" and this is what the Officer is looking at. The Applicant has limited international experience, limited work experience, no demonstrated proficiency in English, and lacks a PhD. She presently lacks the basic prerequisites for an academic posting in Canada. It is the whole picture that was assessed and there was no undue emphasis on the lack of Western or global experience. Without a proficiency in English and a PhD (neither of which the Applicant questions as a necessary qualification) she is unlikely to secure a post as a university professor in Canada. The Applicant even concedes this point by asserting that she will remedy these basic deficiencies, and it cannot be said that the Officer's consideration of them was unreasonable.", "CONCLUSIONS"], ["[85]", "While I do not accept all of the grounds for reviewable error raised by the Applicant, it seems to me that the Decision is unreasonable and falls outside of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> range because the Officer has assumed that the Applicant was obliged to demonstrate immediate economic self-sufficiency either as a University Professor, or at least as a skilled worker, and failed to take into account the brother's offer and guarantee of economic support until the Applicant and her husband had achieved their professional goals.

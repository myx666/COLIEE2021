Her claim is based on her fear that she will be killed by Jonathan Cipres, a man who believes he has fallen in love with her and has been stalking her. When she was 13 years old, Jonathan Cipres began following her. His father was a person of influence in the government and his mother was a lawyer, so when the applicant filed a police complaint, nothing was ever done.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "Mr. Cipres approached the applicant in an empty parking lot on her walk home from school. He tried to force her to kiss him. She pulled away and he hit her in the face and kicked her. She fell to the ground and he tried to rape her. A passerby intervened and prevented the rape. Mr. Cipres ran away but yelled that the applicant was going to be his.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The applicant reported the incident to her mother because she was bleeding. They went to the offices of the Public Ministry and filed a complaint about the attack. She later told them about the attempted rape but they said that they could not proceed with that allegation because it was not written in the doctor's report.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "After she filed the complaint, the applicant and her family began receiving death threats. The applicant believes that the threats were a direct result of having filed the complaint. The applicant and her family felt forced to move.

He ran away and threatened that he was going to come back for the applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The applicant fled Mexico out of fear of Mr. Cipres. She believes that he is well-connected and that she would not be protected by the state if she stayed there. She left Mexico on August 8, 2006, arriving in Toronto. A few weeks later, she made a claim for refugee protection. She keeps in contact with her family who says that they continue to see Mr. Cipres in their neighbourhood and that he continues to call their home.

The applicant filed a police complaint after the first incident, but chose not to after the second incident because she believed that the authorities would not do anything to protect her.

The state is taking measures to try to deal with these persisting issues.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "In addition, the Board found that the state of Mexico is taking steps to change the culture of non-reporting of crime.

The presumption of state protection fails where it is \"objectively unreasonable for the claimant not to have sought the protection of his home authorities\" (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphs 48 and 49).

The Board therefore erred with respect to its analysis of state protection by only looking at the legislative framework, rather than its implementation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "The Board failed to analyze evidence that contradicted its conclusion (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The applicant submits that despite the efforts of the Mexican government, widespread impunity and corruption persists. The decision is completely devoid of any analysis of this fact.

The Board's role was to make findings of fact and arrive at a reasonable decision based on the evidence, even if conflicting. Certain passages from the documentary evidence appear to show that there is some desire by the present government of Mexico to improve the situation, while other passages suggest that protective measures are ineffective. In this circumstance, the Board had a duty to explain why it preferred the evidence of the efforts the state is taking over the evidence that corruption and impunity continue to be a widespread and pervasive reality  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .

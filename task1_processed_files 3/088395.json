A&N argue that slightly less than half of the documents were to-and-from Glaxo documents which Glaxo could have produced in 1990 when the impeachment action commenced.

Glaxo submits that while the act of exporting was not specifically enjoined by the court at trial, the export of zidovudine would require A&N to either import, manufacture or offer it for sale, and all of these activities are otherwise enjoined by the court. Moreover, Glaxo submits that its offer included a request for an undertaking with respect to bulk sales of zidovudine but that this undertaking was clearly separated from the consent injunction identified elsewhere in the offer to settle. Glaxo submits that the request for an undertaking was not expressed in the terms suggested by Apotex but rather in terms which made clear that Apotex was to \"... undertake not to sell zidovudine in bulk form to any person inside or outside Canada who is known by Apotex Inc. or ACIC Ltd. to directly or indirectly sell or supply sellers of zidovudine in pharmaceutical formulation", "in breach of Glaxo Wellcome's patent rights\"", ". Glaxo submits that the undertaking was limited to sales which would result in a breach by other parties of the patent rights of Glaxo Wellcome. Glaxo submits that this provision did not make its offer to settle overbroad, as the broad scope of the court's injunction makes it clear that A&N can neither infringe the patent themselves nor induce or assist others to do so in their place."], ["[51]", "Apotex submits that Glaxo's offer was overbroad in that it sought dismissal of the action brought by Apotex and ACIC Ltd. in the Ontario Court General Division and a waiver of Apotex and ACIC's claims of damages in this action:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.), nor was it in a form that could be accepted under rule 420. Glaxo submits that the", "Spencer", "case differs from the situation at bar, as the Ontario litigation involved claims pertaining to marketing and sales activities respecting the drug zidovudine, all premised on losses suffered by Apotex and ACIC being hindered in making sales of zidovudine. Glaxo submits that these claims cannot be asserted in the face of the judgment pronounced by this court on March 25, 1998."], ["[52]", "Novopharm submits that the court cannot order an increase in costs on account of the offer to settle as it cannot be determined at this point, without expert evidence, whether the financial award to Glaxo of damages arising from sales by Novopharm from 1993 to 1998 will exceed the royalties offered by Novopharm for the period from December 1997 to June 21, 2005,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's offer to settle. Glaxo submits that rule 420 expressly states that the successful litigant's offer to settle is to be compared to the trial judgment, not any offer delivered by the opposing party.

Glaxo recognizes that in", "Ray Plastics", ", the court looked with apparent disfavour upon the fact that the plaintiff had not invited negotiation with respect to the terms of the injunction requested. Glaxo submits, however, that this portion of the court's analysis was tied to its finding that the terms of the injunction sought by the plaintiff were overbroad. Glaxo submits that, as Glaxo's offer was not over-reaching, the court does not have to address whether Glaxo signalled a preparedness to negotiate. Glaxo submits that", "Ray Plastics", "does not introduce requirements of compromise and negotiation which must be met by a party extending an offer to settle. In any case, it is submitted that Glaxo's offer did include a compromise because Glaxo offered to waive its claim for relief arising from any past infringement and its claim for costs in all litigation between the parties."], ["[55]", "While the evidence is not extensive, in my opinion, the nature of Glaxo's offer to settle was sufficient to allow the parties to negotiate a settlement. Moreover, while the principal issue regarding relief may have been the injunction, the relief obtained was nevertheless as favourable or more favourable than Glaxo's offer to settle, as required by rule 420. I find that Glaxo's offer was not overbroad with regard to exporting, inducing others to infringe, and selling bulk forms of zidovudine. On these latter points I accept Glaxo's contentions. I disagree with Apotex's submissions regarding the action in Ontario Court, General Division, and find that Glaxo's offer was not overbroad or in an unacceptable form. While Apotex's argument regarding its inability to accept the offer due to Glaxo's mention of ACIC Limited is thought-provoking, I do not find it convincing."], ["[56]", "I also cannot accept Novopharm's submissions with respect to overreach regarding all the patent claims or its contentions as to an accounting of profits."], ["[57]", "The evidence with respect to A&N's argument that Glaxo's offer fails for lack of compromise or openness to negotiation is not extensive and does not allow the court to make a clear finding regarding openness to negotiation. In any event, the main remedy in patent cases invariably involves an injunction. If I accepted A&N's argument, it would mean that, subject to arguments of overbreadth, rule 420 would have little or no application to patent cases. That cannot be the case."], ["[58]", "In my opinion, both offers of settlement by Glaxo were late in these proceedings and responsive only to A&N's proposals.

To qualify for a permanent resident visa under the federal skilled worker class, the applicant must satisfy the employment-related requirements set out in subsection 75(2) of the Regulations as well as the selection criteria set out in subsection 76(1) of the Regulations relating to education, proficiency in the official languages of Canada, work experience, age, arranged employment and adaptability."], ["[8]", "The officer determined that the applicant was not credible because there were significant discrepancies between the evidence that the applicant had submitted for the student permit application and the evidence that she had submitted for the permanent residence application.

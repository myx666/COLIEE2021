To do this it contacted Tropical, which on or about January 5, 2001, issued a maritime bill of lading (hereinafter \"the Tropical bill of lading\"), which indicated that the consignor and shipper was Nestlé. This bill of lading does not appear to have clearly indicated the status of Tropical in this document. It simply provided that \"CARGO RECEIVED BY TROPICAL SHIPPING AT SHERBROOKE, QUEBEC FOR SHIPMENT VIA PORT OF BELLEDUNE, NEW BRUNSWICK\"."], ["[4]", "Clause 22 of this document further provides the following:", "\"22.

As the ship identified in the bill of lading, the \"Viljandi\", is neither the property of Tropical nor chartered to Tropical, anyone could at the very least conclude that this bill of lading created a contract between Nestlé and the owner or charterer of the ship (MOS being the charterer here), and accordingly, Tropical was taking under this bill of lading as agent."], ["[6]", "However, as can be seen below from paras. 5 to 7 of Aman Kermally's affidavit, filed by Nestlé in opposition to the motion at bar, it appeared that Nestlé never discussed with Tropical the presence of a jurisdiction clause in the Tropical bill of lading. However, Tropical, acting concurrently it would seem, turned around and signed with MOS (the defendant CIS Navigation, Inc., acting at the time for MOS) a bill of lading (\"the MOS bill of lading\"), which unlike the Tropical bill of lading contained a jurisdiction clause in favour of the New York courts."], ["[7]", "This is how Mr. Kermally saw the situation for Nestlé:", "\"1.

Nestlé must have known at the time it negotiated the Tropical bill of lading that the latter was neither the owner nor charterer of the ship \"Viljandi\" mentioned in the bill of lading. Consequently, it was highly likely that Tropical would in return have to approve a bill of lading with the charterer of the ship, MOS.

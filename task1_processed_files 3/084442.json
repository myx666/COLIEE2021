She also indicates that her involvement was open and well-known to her friends and neighbours."], ["[6]", "The Principal Applicant alleges that, despite the fact that the CCM signed the brokered agreement allowing for freedom of speech in Zanzibar and guaranteeing the right to belong to any legitimate political party, the government never adhered to the accord."], ["[7]", "The Principal Applicant indicates that continuous harassment forced her to campaign more discreetly. On January 10, 2000, she was detained by the police and taken to a station for questioning. She was allegedly told by the police that they had video evidence of her participation in a demonstration against the CCM. She denied any participation. She was slapped and forced to sign a paper agreeing not to be involved with the CUF."], ["[8]", "In September, 2000, with an election nearing, the Principal Applicant began to campaign again for the CUF. The election was postponed in some areas because of alleged irregularities with the ballots. The CUF complained that the CCM engaged in foul play by rigging the election results. The CUF ordered its members not to participate in the rescheduled election set for November 7, 2000."], ["[9]", "The Principal Applicant contends that, on November 5, 2000, the police came to her home.

The police reminded the Principal Applicant of her pledge not to be active with the CUF."], ["[10]", "The next day, the Principal Applicant was arrested and detained for three days.

Police killed several persons, and members of the police regularly threatened, mistreated, or occasionally beat suspected criminals during and after their apprehension and interrogation. There were reports that police used torture in Zanzibar. Prison conditions throughout the country remained harsh and life threatening. Arbitrary arrest and detention and prolonged detention remained problems. Police harassment of members and supporters of the political opposition declined significantly following the October reconciliation agreement between the Government and the opposition. The inefficient and corrupt judicial system often did not provide expeditious and fair trials. Pervasive corruption continued to have a broad impact on human rights. The Government infringed on citizens' privacy rights and limited freedom of speech and of the press, and freedom of assembly and association. The Government declared that four government and party officials were non citizens and therefore no longer could retain their positions. Police used excessive force to disperse demonstrations in Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam in January, which resulted in numerous deaths and injuries; more than 2,000 persons were displaced."], ["[36]", "The Applicants accept that this report refers to a substantial decline in the harassment of opposition members after the October agreement, but they submit that the level of police and government abuse outlined in this report cannot be changed overnight or even within a few months.

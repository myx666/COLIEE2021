On February 7, 1988, the applicant applied to the Canadian Pension Commission seeking a pension under ss. 12(1) and 12(2) of the", "Pension Act", ", now s. 81, on the ground that he suffered from osteoarthritis in both shoulders and both hips and hearing loss, all attributable to his service in World War II (Intervenor's Application Record, p. 89).", "\"2. In a decision dated January 12, 1988 (Intervenor's Application Record, pp. 85-88) the Commission rejected the application. It pointed out that 'there is no possible association' between, inter alia, exposure to wet conditions and development of osteoarthritis (Intervenor's Application Record, p. 83).", "\"3. The applicant then sought an Entitlement Board under s. 68 (now s. 88) of the", "Pension Act", "and that Board rendered its decision August 30, 1988 (Intervenor's Application Record, pp. 45-49), pointing out that 'there is no medical evidence to substantiate the claim that climatic conditions were causative factors in the development of osteoarthritis' (Intervenor's Application Record, p. 48) and 'the audiogram is not typical of a noise induced loss' (Intervenor's Application Record, p. 49) and 'the left sided [hearing loss] ... has obviously been caused by the middle ear infection since the low tones are affected as well as the high tones ... [and] ... there is no record of ... any infection in that ear during the course of service' (Intervenor's Application Record, p. 49).", "\"4. The applicant then appealed this decision to the Veterans Appeal Board which rendered its decision August 8, 1989 (Intervenor's Application Record, pp. 28-31) confirming the decision of the Entitlement Board. The Veterans Appeal Board notes that the osteoarthritis in the applicant's hips was first noted by the applicant in the early 1970's and not at discharge [in 1945] or on enrolment in the reserve force in 1954. The osteoarthritis in the shoulders was first diagnosed in 1987 and the Board concludes that the osteoarthritis is unrelated to military service (Intervenor's Application Record, p. 30).", "\"5. With regard to hearing loss the Board notes that the Medical Advisor of the Canadian Pension Commission points out that the audiogram indicates that the hearing loss is not symmetrical as would be expected from aircraft cabin noise and does not show the typical noise-induced hearing loss pattern\" (Intervenor's Application Record, p. 30).", "\"6. The applicant then applied on December 12, 1991 (Intervenor's Application Record, pp. 17-21) for reconsideration of the August 8, 1989, decision based on new evidence, pursuant to s. 12(1) of", "Veterans Appeal Board Act", "\"7. The 'new evidence' upon which the Board was asked to reconsider its August 8, 1989, decision was the letter of Dr. Michael Gross dated November 7, 1991 (Intervenor's Application Record, p. 22) and the letter of Dr. Ian MacMillan dated November 22, 1991 (Intervenor's Application Record, pp. 23-25).", "\"8. With respect to Dr. Gross's letter the Board concludes that: 'his letter is not of significant assistance in the search for some link between the veteran's generalized condition of osteoarthritis noted in the 1970s and 1980s and his sitting in wet conditions in the early 1940s. Indeed, most laymen not only think that it is \"possible\" to link wet conditions to osteoarthritis, they are convinced of the link. On reconsideration, this Board is of the opinion that the earlier panel and the Entitlement Board were correct in their distinction between what is conjecture and what is medical evidence.' (April 24, 1992, decision, Applicant's Application Record, Tab 3, p. 2).", "\"9. With respect to Dr. MacMillan's letter the Board concludes that 'it in no way challenges the reasoning of the earlier panel as it applied to his evidence as it was then before it. There remains an absence of evidence to support his speculation that the left ear condition could have arisen from a noticeable middle ear infection during service in World War II' (April 24, 1992, decision, Applicant's Application Record, Tab 3, p. 2).", "\"10. The decision states that 'this Board has complied with the provisions of s. 10(5) of the", "Veterans Appeal Board Act", "which call for the drawing of every reasonable inference and the resolution of any doubt in the appellant's favour'.

Therefore, entitlement to a pension depends on evidence in the record of the presence of a hearing loss or impairment which can be attributed to or occurred during the applicant's service in World War II. Further, as noted in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the critical date for the determining entitlement is when the disease or condition began, not when the symptoms developed."], ["[9]", "The applicant's first ground for review is essentially that the Board's April 24, 1992, decision was based on medical opinion from the Medical Advisor of the Canada Pension Commission (the Medical Advisor), dated December 8, 1987, which was not disclosed to the applicant. The applicant argued that in not disclosing this medical opinion to him and in using this opinion without giving him a reasonable opportunity to make argument on it, the Board breached the rules of procedural fairness and denied him the benefit of s. 10(4) of the", "Veterans Appeal Board Act"], ["[10]", "In response, the intervenor maintained that as the medical opinion was repeatedly stated in the decisions of the Pension Entitlement Board and the Veterans Appeal Board it was communicated to the applicant. The intervenor submitted that the document itself was referred to in the August 8, 1989, decision of the Board and as such, the applicant was advised of the case he had to meet, whether or not the actual document was provided to him.

In support of this position, the intervenor cited the case of", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)."], ["[11]", "The medical opinion from the Medical Advisor, dated December 8, 1987, summarized the applicant's medical history and stated in part:", "\"Ears and hearing were normal, on enlistment in June WV 20ft. either ear, both eardrums intact.

Mahoney, J.A., made the following comments at pp. 225 and 227:", "\"In my opinion, it is clear that, in the present circumstances, there was no denial of natural justice in the failure to make Treasury Board's initial reply available to the applicant.

In other words, it and the complaint defined the scope of the investigation.\""], ["[14]", "In the case before me, the medical opinion was not only evidence but in fact formed the basis of the Board's decision.

Gross, Coady and MacMillan. As the applicant has focused on the part of the Board's decision dealing with hearing loss I will refer specifically to Dr. MacMillan's letter of November 22, 1991 which reads in part:", "\"This man served as a pilot with the RCAF from 1940-45. He has been aware of a significant left hearing loss since the early 1940's. This patient apparently did not seek any significant medical attention during his time with the Air Force. He is unable to pinpoint any significant episodes of ear infections, etc. but he advises me that during the war years, when he was an active pilot, any problems he encountered with his ears he tended to ignore due to the fact that if he reported to medical personnel, he was afraid that he would be grounded from his flying duties. He feels that his ears must have been normal when he was accepted into air crew in the RCAF in World War II. I would have to agree with him in this regard.", "\"As mentioned in my previous report, this man flew Wellington Aircraft during World War II and from what he advises me, the pilot's left ear was quite close to the engine in that particular aircraft with a considerable noise exposure. This was a well recognized problem in air crew personnel in that particular aircraft ...", "\"When I had seen this man initially on March 20, 1987, his left ear showed a moderately large open dry perforation on the posterior superior quadrant of the left tympanic membrane. The remaining portion of the tympanic membrane showed dense areas of tympanosclerosis and a rather severe left ear mixed hearing loss.", "\"On examination today, the previously noted perforation in the left tympanic membrane is largely healed. The former perforation site is covered with a thin wrinkled retracted fine membrane with a tiny central inferior perforation in the posterior superior quadrant. The generalized dense tympanosclerosis in the remaining portion of the tympanic membrane on the left persists. The ear is dry and clean. The right ear is essentially normal clinically except for some fine tympanosclerosis in the anterior inferior quadrant. The Rhine is positive on the right, negative on the left. The weber lateralizes to the left. I had audiometric assessment done on this man by the Audiologist including impedance testing and a copy of that report is enclosed. It shows a moderate degree of right sensory neural hearing loss and rather severe left mixed hearing loss. The left middle ear shows grossly negative middle ear air pressure ...", "\"Thus I would have to conclude on the basis of the above medical findings and the patient's history that he was either (1) permitted to become a pilot in the RCAF in World War II, either with a preexisting ear condition, which was not recorded or else he would have had to develop a left middle ear and mastoid infection during his service career, which for reasons previously noted was not treated and the above facts plus his noise exposure during his years as a pilot with the RCAF would have significantly contributed to his hearing loss, particularly in the left ear.\""], ["[21]", "The applicant submitted that a reading of the Board's April 24, 1992, decision showed that medical opinions supporting the application were dismissed as \"speculative\" despite the expertise of the doctors involved and the many years that Dr. Coady (and presumably Dr. MacMillan) had known and observed the applicant. The applicant also submitted that the Board's decision narrowly relied on the absence of a medical chain of evidence going back to the applicant's service in the Royal Canadian Air Force between 1940 and 1945."], ["[22]", "With respect to the hearing loss, the applicant argued that the Board ignored the following evidence supporting his application:", "(1) the evidence of the applicant as to his clear recollection of the effects of his hearing loss shortly after the Second World War;", "(2) the applicant's evidence and its support in Dr. MacMillan's opinion letter dated November 22, 1991 as to how and why his left ear hearing loss was not revealed in his 1954 medical examination preliminary to admission to the Air Force Reserve;", "(3) the opinion of Dr. MacMillan, a specialist in audiology, that the applicant must have had a middle ear infection during the Second World War."], ["[23]", "After reviewing the decisions of the Boards, I accept the applicant's argument that all the hearings and decisions relating to himself were dependant upon the Canada Pension Commission (Commission) decision, which was simply appropriated in a shorter version at each level. There appeared to be no consideration or real testing of the evidence of the applicant, Dr. Coady's or Dr. MacMillan's, against the evidence presented by the Commission. It may have been that the Board found the Commission's evidence better or more credible, which it had every right to do. However, my concern is that in accepting the Commission's evidence over that of the applicant's the Board failed to comment as to why the applicant's evidence was not acceptable or credible, particularly Dr. MacMillan's evidence. The Board restated the Commission's medical evidence but did not deal with Dr. MacMillan's view that the hearing loss could have been the result of infection and noise. Instead, the Board simply dismissed Dr. MacMillan's evidence as \"speculation\". It must be clearly shown that the Board considered all the evidence, especially that of a specialist who relied upon all the circumstances under which the applicant served in the war, before coming to a proper decision. In the circumstances of this case, I am not convinced that the Board did so."], ["[24]", "Moreover, in dealing with this review, it is also necessary to keep in mind the provisions of s. 10(5) of the", "Veterans Appeal Board Act", ", which provides that:", "\"(5) In all appeals to the Board, the Board shall", "(a) draw from all the circumstances of the case and all the evidence presented to it every reasonable inference in favour of the appellant;", "(b) accept any uncontradicted evidence presented to it by the appellant that it considers to be credible in the circumstances;", "(c) resolve in favour of the appellant any doubt, in the weighing of evidence, as to whether the appellant had established a case,\"", "Therefore, based on the record, I have difficulty accepting that the Board did not commit a reviewable error when it accepted, in fact relied almost exclusively, on an unsigned medical opinion that was not disclosed to the applicant and had been reiterated in previous decisions, without commenting on qualified expert evidence which indicated that the applicant's hearing loss might have been attributed to infection and noise. This in my view was also not keeping within the provisions of s. 3 of the", "Veterans Appeal Board Act", ", which reads:", "\"The provisions of this Act and of any other Act of Parliament or any regulations thereunder conferring or imposing jurisdiction, powers, duties or functions on the Board shall be liberally construed and interpreted to the end that the recognized obligations of the people and Government of Canada to those who have served their country so well and to their dependants may be fulfilled.\""], ["[25]", "The applicant's third ground is that the Board erred in failing to give the applicant the benefit of every reasonable inference contrary to s. 10(5) of the", "Veterans Appeal Board Act", ".

Further, I agree with counsel for the intervenor that", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , does not stand for the proposition that the Board cannot reject medical evidence because it is contradicted by other medical evidence. The Board is entitled to accept the evidence which it considers the most cogent as long as it considers the special rules enunciated in s. 10(5) of the", "Act", "and does not employ defective reasoning in evaluating the evidence. Therefore, in light of the Board's statement it would be difficult to find that the Board did forget its obligation under s. 10(5), although, as I indicated earlier, the flaw in the Board's reasoning was that it simply repeated previous decisions and did not indicate why it rejected the applicant's evidence."], ["[26]", "The applicant argued, in the alternative, that the Board failed to consider the evidence of aggravation of an injury or a disease incurred during military service as required by s. 21(1)(a) and (d) of the", "Pension Act", ".

Further, where, as here, defence counsel makes a tactical decision not to pursue disclosure of certain documents, the court will generally be unsympathetic to a plea that full disclosure of those documents was not made.' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[49]", "The applicant admitted that, at the time of the vacation proceedings against him, he knew that the RCMP had interviewed at least three witnesses in Rwanda who apparently exculpated him of any wrongdoing. However, he claimed that he did not know the RCMP had recorded or transcribed these interviews, and that he was unaware of RCMP practices regarding the collection and retention of evidence. He also submitted that for most of the vacation proceedings, he was unrepresented by counsel, did not know that the Minister had a duty to disclose exculpatory information, and that he had a right to request further disclosure beyond what was already given to him by the Minister. It is only after meeting with another Rwandan facing similar allegations that he would have learned about this.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[50]", "I do not find this argument convincing, for several reasons. First of all, it is no excuse to argue that he could not exercise his right to request further disclosure because he did not know whether the RCMP recorded or transcribed these interviews, or what the practices of the RCMP are regarding the collection and retention of evidence. If he believed that some witnesses interviewed by the RCMP had given exculpatory statements, he could at least have asked for these statements and attempted to have them disclosed to him; all he was risking was to be told there was no record of these interviews.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[51]", "Moreover, the applicant cannot succeed on the ground that he was unable to safeguard his rights due to the lack of counsel. Litigants who choose to represent themselves must accept the consequences of their choice:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 16;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 35. Moreover, the applicant was represented by counsel during his application for leave and for judicial review of the September 29, 2006 vacation and exclusion decision, where again disclosure was not raised as an issue. It is simply not the Board's function at a hearing for an application to reopen to consider issues that should have been raised in a judicial review application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[52]", "This case bears no similarity with the case of the other Rwandan upon which he relies. It is clear from the affidavit filed by Mr. Ndihokubwayo in support of the applicant that his counsel (who, incidentally, is now representing the applicant) had requested disclosure of the information contained in CBSA's file as soon as he received notice of the application to vacate refugee protection. He then made a motion to be heard at a pre-hearing conference. Throughout the proceedings, he insisted on having complete disclosure of witness statements. Also of significance is the fact that in Mr. Ndihokubwayo's case, the witness statements containing exculpatory evidence at issue were within the possession of the CBSA. The evidence originated from the RCMP and it was the CBSA's withholding of evidence they had knowledge of which was at issue. In light of these facts, the Tribunal could reasonably conclude that the applicant's case was not comparable to Mr. Ndihokubwayo's situation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[53]", "Finally, the applicant faces another hurdle in his attempt to challenge the decision of the Tribunal to dismiss his application to reopen his refugee status vacation proceeding. As noted by the Tribunal, even if the applicant had not been excluded for the murder of Francine, he would still have been excluded for the more obvious crimes against humanity in which he was found to be complicit by reason of his active involvement in the FAR. As the Tribunal stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Moreover, even if the exculpatory statements of Bishop Sebununguri and Aimable Rutaremara had been introduced and given full weight by the member, the applicant might not have been found excluded on that basis, but the more obvious crimes against humanity in which he was found to be complicit by reason of his active involvement in the FAR would nevertheless have yielded the same result. After a review of the member's decision it is clear to the tribunal that the applicant was not excluded only because of the murder of one Francine but because of his complicity in crimes against humanity while serving in the FAR. The applicant is not alleging that exculpatory evidence existed for that aspect of the case. The tribunal finds that the undisclosed information was not determinative in this case. In the circumstances, the applicant has suffered no prejudice.\" Applicant's Record, p. 10  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[54]", "This conclusion was entirely reasonable. A simple perusal of the vacation proceeding transcript reveals that the applicant was highly connected to the governing regime of Rwanda during the genocide of 1994. The applicant testified that he was able to freely enter the presidential palace and wander around Kigali for two weeks while the genocide commenced. His implausible claim that he was unaware of the extent of the massacres was rejected by the Tribunal. Since the applicant has already unsuccessfully sought judicial review of that decision, he should be precluded from attempting to collaterally attack that decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[55]", "Had the Tribunal decided the applicant's case exclusively on the ground of his involvement in the murder of Francine, he might have been entitled to a new hearing (assuming, for the sake of the argument, that there has been a breach of the applicant's right to a fair hearing and that he has not waived his right). But this was not even the most serious ground to vacate his refugee status. It may well be, as the Supreme Court of Canada said in", "Cardinal and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 661  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that \"the denial of a right to a fair hearing must always render a decision invalid, whether or not it may appear to a reviewing court that the hearing would likely have resulted in a different decision\". But when the impugned decision also rests on other grounds which are untainted by the breach of natural justice principles, there would be no point to send it back on judicial review: see", "Lord's Evangelical Church of Deliverance and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[56]", "The applicant speculated that the exculpatory witness statements could have established that he was among the minority who used their position in the FAR to save Tutsi civilians rather than to kill them. But there is not a shred of evidence to support that theory, which was roundly rejected by the Tribunal on the applicant's vacation hearing. And nowhere in his affidavit filed in support of this application for judicial review does the applicant mention that Bishop Sebununguru or his cook Aimabe Rutaremera would have exculpated him from his complicity in crimes against humanity by reason of his involvement in the FAR. The possibility that their statements might have been relevant to this more serious ground for excluding him is therefore extremely remote, and I am therefore unable to conclude that the Tribunal was unreasonable in finding that the undisclosed information was not determinative at least in that respect.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[57]", "For all the foregoing reasons, I am therefore of the view that this application for judicial review ought to be dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[58]", "Counsel for the applicant proposed four questions for certification purposes:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "1. Within the context of the judicial review hearing where the Minister intervenes to seek the exclusion of the claimant, is the Minister under a duty to disclose all relevant evidence in his possession, including exculpatory evidence, subject only to any claims to privilege which would be assessed by the tribunal?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "2.

On the other hand, counsel for the applicant strenuously stressed that", "Charkaoui No. 2", "has changed the law with respect to disclosure. Since these issues are recurring and deserve to be clarified by the Court of Appeal, I am prepared to accept the certification of the four questions submitted by the applicant. As I made it clear in my reasons, I do not think that they are determinative in the context of this particular case; but in light of the serious consequences of these proceedings for the applicant, it is well worth having the benefit of the Court of Appeal's assessment of these matters.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "ORDER  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[62]", "THIS COURT ORDERS that", ":  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "1.

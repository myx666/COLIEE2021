On March 9, 2015, the Respondent requested a case management conference to address two \"important issues\". First, because \"the applicant raised the argument that SVB Inc. and SVC Co. Inc. are not federal undertakings as contemplated in the Code\", the Respondent submits a 2009 letter from the Manitoba Ministry of Labour and Immigration giving the opinion that the \"matters\" (apparently the dispute between the Respondent and the Applicant) fall under federal and not provincial jurisdiction. Second, in response to evidence about cash receipts, the Respondent submits the affidavit of Amber Peters, a former secretary of Mr. Walia, who denies ever issuing certain cash payments to the Respondent or his wife."], ["[29]", "Prothonotary Lafreni√®re denied the request for a case management conference. At the hearing, the Respondent tried to introduce his new evidence, over the objection of the Applicant. I ruled from the bench that the documents sought to be introduced by the Respondent are inadmissible, essentially for two reasons. First, I agree with counsel for the Applicant that the Respondent is attempting to circumvent the December 22, 2014 Order by Prothonotary Lafreni√®re preventing him from filing affidavits. Because the Respondent was late in filing his record, he was not permitted to file affidavits, but only a memorandum. Therefore, he should not be able to file affidavits or evidence now."], ["[30]", "In any event, the new documents are not relevant to the core issues on judicial review. On the corporate entities, the Applicant has not even argued that the corporations (SVB Inc. and SVB Co. Inc.) are not federal undertakings. On the issue of cash receipts, the question of whether or not cash advances were issued to the Respondent or his wife is not at issue in this judicial review. Therefore, these documents are at best peripheral to the current proceeding.", "A.", "Did the referee breach procedural fairness?"], ["[31]", "The Applicant makes six allegations with respect to procedural fairness. First, he argues that the referee's substantial delay prejudiced the Applicant because by 2013, it would be nearly impossible to find possible rebuttal witnesses. Second, the referee displayed a disregard for the administration of justice by losing the original copy of the alleged contract. Third, the referee displayed bias and racial prejudice by referring to a third party as a \"negro\"; Mr. Walia is dark-skinned and sensitive to racial prejudice. Fourth, in August 2013, the referee waved a rubber mallet (used as a gavel) in the face of the Applicant's lawyer, and the Applicant felt threatened. Fifth, the referee breached natural justice by allowing the Respondent to modify his claim after the Applicant had closed his case. Sixth, natural justice was breached because the Applicant was required to present his entire case first. The referee has authority under paragraph 251.12(2)(", ") to set procedure, but was required to give full opportunity to the parties to present evidence; this was not done, since the Applicant did not have a full opportunity to present evidence."], ["[32]", "In my view, the delay did not breach procedural fairness. The reasons for the long beak between 2011 and 2013 are not clear: the referee's notes simply say there was a drop-off in communication. In his reasons, the referee indicates that counsel for the Applicant asked for the adjournment in November 2011, indicating that he would not be available until after April 16th, 2012. Having heard nothing from the parties, the referee wrote them both in March 2013 and asked if the matter was settled or if they were proceeding. In those circumstances, the delay cannot be blamed on the Respondent. Be that as it may, there is no evidence of prejudice to the Applicant in resuming proceedings following the almost 2-year hiatus. The Applicant argues it lost the opportunity to call rebuttal witnesses, but this argument does not hold up. The Applicant had closed his case after the first days of hearings in June 2011. Nonetheless, the Applicant did call a rebuttal witness in 2013, Mr. Noval. Moreover, there is no evidence of prejudice: in his affidavit, Mr. Walia does not say which other witnesses he would have liked to call but could not call due to delay. Further, the referee's hearing notes do not refer to any motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution when the hearing resumed in June 2013; presumably, Mr. Walia did not raise this issue at the hearing, and Mr. Boudreau was no longer his lawyer. As far as I can see, the Applicant did not request to call any other witnesses, and was not prevented from doing so because of the delay."], ["[33]", "The allegation pursuant to which the loss of the original contract breaches the Applicant's right to", "audi alteram partem", "is also unfounded. First of all, there is no evidence that the referee is responsible for the loss of that document. Moreover, there were two copies of that alleged contract on file (Exhibits 16 and 33)."], ["[34]", "As for the order of presenting the evidence, the referee has authority under paragraph 251.12(2)(", ") of the Code to set procedures, but must ensure that all parties have the opportunity to present evidence. While the standard of review is usually correctness for issues pertaining to procedural fairness, this is an instance where \"a degree of deference\" is due, since this is a review of the referee's procedural choices: see", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED."], ["[35]", "In my view, the referee fulfilled his obligation in this case, although the presentation of evidence was admittedly chaotic. The Applicant was permitted and did cross-examine the Respondent and the Respondent's witness; further, the Applicant was allowed to call an additional witness (Joseph Noval) in June 2013, after the Applicant had closed his case in 2011. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Applicant was prevented from calling additional witnesses after the Respondent's cross-examination. In short, I have not been convinced that the referee's chosen order of presenting evidence caused any prejudice to the Applicant."], ["[36]", "The same is true of the decision to allow the Respondent to present an amended claim on June 20, 2013 (Exhibit 46). The record shows that the Respondent did indeed present an amended claim on June 20, 2013, in the middle of his cross-examination, and long after the Applicant had closed his case. Applicant's counsel objected to the admission of this document, but the referee allowed it, with the proviso that the Applicant's counsel would be given time to review it and compare it to the prior versions of the claim. The referee therefore considered the issue, decided to allow the document, and made allowances to minimize prejudice to the Applicant. Moreover, Applicant's counsel agreed to this procedure (Hearing transcript June 20, 2011, pp 383-386, Applicant's Record, pp 633-636). Considering the referee's authority to set the procedures and the limited deference that is owed to his decisions in that respect, I see no reason to intervene. There was no breach of natural justice in permitting the Respondent to submit this amended claim."], ["[37]", "In fact, the amended claim was substantially similar to a document submitted earlier in the proceeding (see Exhibits 18 and 19): it claimed the same number of hours, but recalculated the wages owed based on overtime hourly rates. The Applicant had ample opportunity to cross-examine the Respondent on this amended claim; actually, most of June 20 and August 7, 2013 were spent scrutinizing this document and other evidence submitted by the Respondent. In the end, the referee did not accept the overtime rates claimed. Therefore, while it may be unorthodox to allow an amended claim that late in the proceeding, there is no reason for this Court to intervene."], ["[38]", "Counsel for the Applicant also made a number of allegations tending to show that the referee was biased. Having carefully read the record and the available transcript, I am unable to find clear evidence of prejudice against the Applicant. This is not to say that the referee and the Applicant did not have a strained relationship: indeed, the Applicant asked the referee to recuse himself twice, and applied for judicial review of one such refusal. For his part, the referee was clearly not impressed with Mr. Walia or his counsel. The referee and Mr. Purves had several acrimonious exchanges during the hearing, including the alleged \"mallet incident\" on August 7, 2013, of which I will say more shortly. In the decision, the referee found Mr. Walia \"not in the least bit credible\", and found that he attempted to manipulate the witnesses and had suppressed evidence. While there were certainly outbursts and moments of unprofessionalism at the hearing by all parties, in my view this does not reveal a bias. Nor is bias established by the mere fact that the referee accepted the evidence of the contract by the Respondent on the back of a business card while rejecting other pieces of evidence coming from the Applicant."], ["[39]", "The racial bias allegation is similarly a red herring. The Applicant alleges that the referee used the word \"negro\" to refer to a third party during the hearing on June 5-6, 2013, for which there is no transcript. Justice Gagn√© did not rule on the merits of this racial bias allegation, but did recommend that the proceedings be recorded. Mr. Walia alleges in his affidavit that the referee continued to use this word during the hearing dates captured on the record (June 19-20 and August 7, 2013). While the referee did refer to a third party as a \"negro, a black fellow\", and continued to defend the use of this word (see Applicant's Record pp 421, 725-726, and 1004-1006) this does not establish that the referee has a racial bias against Mr. Walia himself. Admittedly, the referee's continued use of the word after Mr. Walia complained is insensitive, but there is no evidence that it tainted the referee's findings."], ["[40]", "As for the \"rubber mallet incident\", while bizarre, it displays the acrimonious relationship between the referee and Applicant's counsel, but does not rise to the level of bias. At the start of the hearing on August 7, 2013, the referee explained:", "I brought a gavel or mallet, and when I rap it on the table everyone is going to quit speaking except the court reporter and myself, who is containing his mirth. (...) So that hopefully will curtail any bickering back and forth.", "(Transcript August 7, 2013, p 515; Applicant's Record, p 766.)"], ["[41]", "During the cross-examination of the Respondent by Mr. Purves, the referee intervened in the questioning. In a peculiar and seemingly childish exchange, Mr. Purves said \"you can hammer your mallet all you want\" and \"point your mallet at me again\". The exchange continued, and at one point Mr. Walia interjected to say: \"It is threatening, sir. It is threatening, sir. I'm threatened. It's threatening, sir. I'm threatened\", and apparently stood up and waved his hands. At this point, the referee ejected Mr. Walia from the proceedings. After a brief pause, Mr. Walia was allowed back in, under Mr. Purves' instructions that he was not to speak unless addressed by the referee or Mr. Purves (see Applicant's Record pp 833-838). From this exchange, it can be assumed that the relationship between the referee and Mr. Purves had degenerated and that the tension in the room was very high. The use of a mallet was certainly odd, and even unprofessional and capricious. I have not been convinced, however, that bias has been established."], ["[42]", "The test for bias was most clearly enunciated by Justice de Grandpr√© in his dissenting reasons in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED:", "...the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information ...[The] test is \"what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly."], ["[43]", "An allegation of bias is obviously serious, and shall not be made lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, conjecture or impressions of an applicant or his counsel, but must be supported by cogent evidence. I have not been convinced that this threshold has been met in the case at bar. The hearing was obviously tense, and at times during the Respondent's cross-examination, the referee intervened to clarify or move the cross-examination forward, almost taking the role of an advocate for the Respondent. There were several tense exchanges between the referee and Mr. Purves (see for example Applicant's Record at pp 405-406, 623-626 and 833-838), and there are also indications that strong words were exchanged between the parties during breaks (see for example Applicant's Record, pp 412-413, 926-931). From what I can tell, it was an unpleasant and protracted proceeding.

The referee's powers under subsection 251.12(2) are quite broad: paragraph 251.12(2)(", ") of the Code gives the referee the power to add any party who, in the referee's opinion, \"has substantially the same interest as one of the parties and could be affected by the decision\". The Applicant argues that the referee improperly added the two corporations and Ms. Rai, because there is no formal connection between the Applicant corporation and those parties. It is true that Ms. Rai is the sole shareholder of SVB Inc., but is neither a shareholder nor director of the Applicant corporation. That being said, neither the corporate structure nor the absence of Ms. Rai as a witness precludes the referee from adding these parties. The referee explains briefly why he added the parties: it was based on the testimony and exhibits of three witnesses (the Respondent, Raymond Buors, and Joseph Noval), as well as Mr. Walia's admission (\"my wife was president of all the companies\") and the interchangeable use of the business names. The companies all share the same address, and the evidence showed that Ms. Rai was involved in the operations in some capacity. In fact, the business card on which the terms of the contract were written (Exhibit 6) itself says \"SVB Inc.\" and shows Mr. Walia as the business manager."], ["[46]", "In short, there was ample evidence to show the connection and confusion between the different companies and individuals. The referee determined on the facts that these parties had substantially the same interest and were likely to be affected. In my view, adding these parties is consistent with the purpose of Part III of the Code, which is to protect individual workers and create certainty in the labour market, because it ensures that the Respondent will be able to recover the wages owed (see", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED). The fact that one liable party (SVB Co. Inc.) may not exist, as the Applicant argues, has no bearing on the standing of the other added parties (SVB Inc., Sapna Rai, and Mr. Walia). I find, therefore, that the referee's decision to add these parties is reasonable."], ["[47]", "Counsel for the Applicant also contends that the referee acted without jurisdiction because there was no employer-employee relationship. Here again, I agree with the Respondent that the referee could reasonably come to that conclusion. Both the inspector and the referee found an employment relationship by applying the common law factors to the facts, and the Applicant's only argument to dispute this finding is that the rationale linking the facts of this case to the common law principle is brief and is lacking in the substantive examination of the applicable law."], ["[48]", "The referee gave reasons for confirming the inspector's finding: he applied several common law factors in finding the requisite level of control and direction for an employment relationship, as can be seen from the quote of his reasons reproduced at paragraph 23 of these reasons. The referee also explained why he found an employment relationship despite the fact that the Respondent was paid through a corporation (Decision, pp 26-27). Overall, the referee's reasons do reflect the law and are not superficial. Contrary to the Applicant's contention, the", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "decision cited by the referee for the proposition that the language used in an employment contract is not determinative to the existence of an employment relationship was relevant. Accordingly, there is no reason to disturb the referee's finding."], ["[49]", "The remaining findings are findings of fact that are entirely reasonable. The Applicant contests the referee's findings on the terms of the contract and hours worked, and argues that the referee gave too little weight to the alleged contract, the original version of which was lost, and to the employer's contemporaneous records (invoices and log books). In essence, the Applicant asks this Court to reweigh the evidence duly considered by the referee. In my view, the referee gave ample reasons why he favoured the Respondent's testimony and handwritten notes about the terms of the contract (Exhibit 6) over the alleged contract prepared by the employer (Exhibit 16), and why he preferred the Respondent's after-the-fact account of hours worked over the contemporaneous written records. The referee found Mr. Walia not credible as a witness; he found the Respondent credible, and his version corroborated by other witnesses; he found that the employer had \"suppressed\" the log books; and he also accepted the Respondent's explanation for the discrepancies between the log books and the actual trips and hours worked. Regarding the high number of hours worked, the referee also explained why he allowed the hours, sometimes up to 24 hours per day: he allowed all hours the Respondent was engaged or was kept out of town (Decision, p 30; quoted at para 24 of these reasons). Given that the Respondent was often stranded or working extra hours to repair equipment, the high number of hours in February and March is not unreasonable on its face; rather, it is explained and based on the evidence. In short, there is no reason to reweigh the evidence and disturb the referee's findings of fact.", "V.", "Conclusion"], ["[50]", "For all of the foregoing reasons, I come to the conclusion that this application for judicial review ought to be dismissed.

The immigration officer determined that the applicant was inadmissible to Canada because he failed to comply with his residency obligation as a permanent resident. The applicant did not challenge the legal validity of the departure order. Rather, the issue before the IAD was whether the applicant had established sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations to overcome the breach of the residency requirement."], ["[2]", "For the following reasons, the application is dismissed.", "I.", "Background"], ["[3]", "The applicant is a citizen of Iran. He landed in Canada with his wife and two children in March 2002 as a permanent resident in the Investor Class. Two weeks after landing in Canada, the applicant and his family went back to Iran because his children had to return to school. The family returned to Canada in June 2003 and settled in Montreal."], ["[4]", "During the five years preceding the immigration officer's decision, the applicant was present in Canada for approximately 331 days out of the 730 days required to maintain permanent residence under subsection 28(2) of the Act."], ["[5]", "The applicant claims that during the reference period (August 24, 2004 to August 19, 2009), he was required to spend considerable time in Iran for two main reasons. First, he had to close his factories, lay off workers, provide employees with salaries and benefits and sell assets that belonged to him and his family. Second, as of 2007, his presence was required in Iran on a regular basis to deal with court proceedings in which he was involved.", "II.", "The decision under review"], ["[6]", "The IAD determined that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations to warrant granting special relief to the applicant."], ["[7]", "First, the IAD considered the extent of the non-compliance with the residency obligation, or the legal impediment, and found that it was significant as the applicant spent less than half the days in Canada, as required by subsection 28(2) of the Act. The IAD also found that the applicant did not take his residency obligation very seriously."], ["[8]", "Second, the IAD considered both the reasons for the applicant's departure and whether these reasons were imperious. The IAD noted that after the applicant and his family landed in Canada, they had to return to Iran because the applicant's children needed to go back to school. It also noted the reasons put forward by the applicant to explain his departure from Canada and extend his stay in Iran, after his family settled in Montreal. The IAD indicated that the applicant said that he had to close his factories over a period of time and compensate his workers. The IAD also mentioned that the applicant testified that he had approximately $5 million worth of assets still in Iran and that he needed to transfer his money slowly and over a period of time, in order to respect Iranian law. The IAD further noted that the applicant testified that he needed to be present in Iran because he was involved in Court proceedings against his brother and sister-in-law, who had stolen approximately $2 million from him in lands, machinery and workshops."], ["[9]", "The IAD did not challenge the truth of these statements. However, it was not satisfied that the applicant had established that he had to stay in Iran for as long as he did and that it was not possible for him to spend more time in Canada. The IAD remarked that it was difficult to believe that the applicant found time to vacation outside of Iran during the reference period but was not able to come to Canada. The IAD also noted that the applicant could have tried to stay in Canada, while his children were attending school in Iran."], ["[10]", "The third factor considered by the IAD related to the applicant's establishment in Canada. While it found that the applicant had some degree of establishment in Canada, the IAD noted that he had only transferred a portion of the money that he was legally permitted to transfer to Canada over the past 10 years. The IAD found that the applicant did not have the degree of establishment that he could have had, had he made all the necessary efforts to transfer his money as quickly as possible."], ["[11]", "Regarding the best interests of the children, the IAD noted that they were over the age of 18 and that the Federal Court has clearly established that only minor children must be considered in this type of assessment (", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED). In this case, the only minor child involved was the applicant's grandson. The IAD acknowledged that the applicant's grandson had a right to know his grandparents and that this was a positive factor in its consideration, however it did not find that this was determinative of the decision since the child lived in Canada with his parents."], ["[12]", "The IAD considered the hardship caused to both the family and the applicant if the appeal were refused. The IAD noted that the applicant's departure from Canada would be sad for the applicant and his family. However, it indicated that the applicant could apply for a visitor's visa and when he is ready to come to Canada permanently, the family could sponsor him. The IAD found that, in the interim, the family will continue to be in the same situation as it had been for the last five years."], ["[13]", "The IAD explained that it gave a lot of weight to the legal impediment of the applicant's residency requirement. It also noted that the applicant had not come back to Canada at the first opportunity, that he has a house in Iran in which he could live, and that, over the time he had been in Canada, he had not transferred to Canada the amount of money that he could have. Accordingly, the IAD concluded that the applicant's level of establishment in Canada was not what it could have been if he had really tried to transfer all of his business to Canada.", "III.", "Issues and standards of review"], ["[14]", "The applicant challenged the IAD's decision on three fronts, which raised the following issues:", "• Did the IAD err in its assessment of the evidence and the circumstances of the applicant?", "• Did the IAD provide adequate reasons?", "• Did a breach in procedural fairness arise because of errors in the translation?"], ["[15]", "It is well established that the factual conclusions and the IAD's assessment of humanitarian and compassionate considerations involve a high degree of discretion.

He also argues that he explained to the IAD that, while he was in Canada in 2007, some of his Iranian assets were stolen from him by his brother and sister-in-law with the help of three other people. He supported this allegation with documentary evidence; the applicant submitted a judgment dated September 28, 2008 from the Public Prosecutor's Office of Isfahan accepting the applicant's request to safeguard approximately US $1.2 million of property of the accused. At the time the applicant submitted written submissions to this Court, the applicant's file was ready to be presented to an Iranian court of judgment."], ["[23]", "The applicant is of the view that the IAD should have explained why it afforded no weight to the documentary evidence establishing the court proceedings in Iran, since there was no question regarding his credibility."], ["[24]", "The applicant further argues that his level of establishment in Canada is far more than the IAD's decision implied and that there were extenuating circumstances preventing him from transferring more of his assets to Canada than he did."], ["[25]", "The applicant also alleges that while he was investing in Canada, he was going through a parallel process in Iran, disposing of his assets. The applicant argues that he stated to the IAD that, in Iran, it is impossible to close down workshops and businesses and fire all the workers immediately. He explained to the IAD that during this process, he was only able to close down his businesses slowly and transfer money to Canada. The applicant argues that the IAD should have stated why these explanations were rejected."], ["[26]", "The applicant further argues that the reference by the IAD to his travel was irrelevant, since all of his travel outside of Iran occurred prior to the reference period. Despite the fact that there may have been confusion on this issue in his testimony, the entries in his passport clearly established that his trips were made before the reference period. In the applicant's view, it was an error on the part of the IAD to ignore this evidence."], ["[27]", "The respondent, for his part, argues that the IAD's decision is reasonable. The respondent alleges that the IAD considered all of the relevant factors in its decision and assessed all of the evidence submitted by the applicant. The respondent further contends that the IAD's reasons are adequate. In the respondent's view, the IAD did not need to explain in detail the weight that it attributed to the evidence and to each factor.

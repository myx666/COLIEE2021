Section 18.2 allows this court, on an application for judicial review, to make such interim orders as it considers appropriate pending the final disposition of the application. According to the above sections, I believe that this court has jurisdiction to issue an Order restraining the Minister from deporting the applicants pending the outcome of s. 114(2) applications for landing on humanitarian or compassionate grounds. The facts peculiar to this case, and the implication  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "that a risk assessment should be done before deporting failed refugee claimants in order to determine whether deportation may violate their", "Charter", "rights, cry out for such an outcome.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[56]", "By way of judicial review, the applicants, who are unsuccessful refugee claimants with a long history of residency in Canada, have challenged the constitutional validity of removal orders requiring their deportation to Chile.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[57]", "A technical problem with this case is the decision being challenged, that being a decision primarily administrative in nature. However, there are numerous substantive grounds upon which I can resolve this case, thus overcoming this shortcoming.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[58]", "The applicants state that they are afraid to return to Chile because they face a risk of extra-judicial killing or torture. However, they have already had their claims to refugee status rejected. New facts seem to have arisen since 1994 which go to the issue of risk, but the applicants have not sought to have their refugee claim redetermined. As counsel for the applicants has stated, it would be pointless for the applicants to try to reopen their refugee claims (yet again) over twenty years after their claims were made, to try to establish that they still fit within the definition of a Convention refugee. I certainly agree that the issues have gone beyond that in relation to the position the applicants are in now. Considering the length of time that has elapsed since the original claims to refugee status, a reopening of their refugee claims may not be the most appropriate route to dispose of this case, anyway.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[59]", "The applicants have pointed out a potential deficiency in the removals process. This deficiency is constitutionally relevant if the applicants can establish, on the facts, that they face a risk of harm if deported to Chile, such harm as would be an affront to Canadian standards of decency.

There is, however, authority for the discretionary remedy of an Order prohibiting the deportation of the applicants pending the outcome of a s. 114(2) application in which the applicants'", "Charter", "rights,", "amongst other factors", ", will be determined. Counsel for the applicants submits that the evidence shows that, in the applicants' 19 years of residence in Canada, they have become well established and have led exemplary lives, and are raising their children well. These are factors that are relevant to a s. 114(2) application for admission to Canada on humanitarian or compassionate grounds, but not to this application for judicial review. There is a process available to the applicants in which their concerns would be most properly addressed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[62]", "It must be remembered that this couple has been in Canada for almost 20 years, and has never been in trouble with the law here. The suggestion here is that the applicants have helped the police forces both here and in Chile. They have been able to secure Minister's Permits in Canada, and have twice been approved in principle for landing in Canada. These are indications of leaning in favour of them. In addition, the extent of the extraordinary waiting period of time for a decision of the Federal Court of Appeal must be taken into account.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[63]", "The real issue here is whether this couple should be permitted to stay in Canada on humanitarian or compassionate grounds, pursuant to s. 114(2) of the", "Act", ".

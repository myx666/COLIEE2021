By way of example, Example 20B states that the process described will give \"the title compound\"; the title compound in Example 20 is a mixture of diastereomers.

The more serious problem with Novopharm's submission is that Schering was not required to make each of the individual compounds claimed, provided that there was a sound prediction that the claimed compounds of Claim 12 would be useful. Therefore, the fact that each of the eight compounds claimed in Claim 12 has not been made has no bearing on the proper construction of that claim.

Dr. Bartlett's testimony on this question was particularly helpful. When asked in direct examination about his view of the construction of Claim 12, Dr Bartlett noted that chemists will \"use the term compound when what we are talking about is a conceptual structure\". He also pointed out aspects of the '206 Patent that would lead a skilled reader to interpret Claim 12 as a claim to eight individual compounds. One such point is that the patent teaches separating mixtures of compounds to obtain individual stereoisomers, thereby inferring that individual stereoisomers are the claimed products. Even Dr. Moody, in cross-examination, agreed that the patent teaches to separate mixtures by known methods such as conventional chromatographic separation or fractional crystallization. If Novopharm's construction is correct and the claims refer only to mixtures, then why would the inventors instruct the skilled reader on how to separate such mixtures?"], ["[117]", "Dr. Bartlett also referred to Claim 8, a claim not in dispute but which is described as a \"compound\". With no stereochemistry identified, there are 32 possible compounds. On Novopharm's interpretation, Claim 8 would be a mixture of all 32 compounds. This, as Dr. Bartlett opined, would lead to an absurdity since Example 67 of the '206 Patent illustrates the preparation of an all-S configuration compound that would be included in Claim 8. Why would an inventor explicitly describe the preparation of a compound in the specification and then claim the compound only as a mixture with 31 others?"], ["[118]", "In sum, I prefer the evidence of Dr. Bartlett and the other experts for Sanofi, Schering and Apotex over that of Dr. Ehlers and Dr. Moody.

In my view, a skilled reader would not embark on a dry, linguistic interpretation of this patent but would read the claims in the context of the specification and having regard to the inventor's purpose. Reading Claim 12 as proposed by Novopharm is not a reading by a mind willing to understand but by a mind seeking to distort the logical meaning that flows from a reading of the claims in their context.

However, as described above, the Schering scientists' \"Antihypertensive Program\" contained only one testing of a 5,5-bicyclic ring compound in the R configuration at that position.

This finding means that the Defendants have satisfied their burden of demonstrating, on a balance of probabilities, that Schering could not soundly predict, as of October 20, 1981, that at least four of the eight compounds of Claim 12 (i.e. those with an R configuration at the carboethoxy position) would meet the promise of the patent.

As far as I can see, Schering did not have or develop significant advancements to the hypothetical framework."], ["[207]", "Dr. Bartlett, in his reports and testimony, explored how Schering could have used the Cushman spatial theory to predict the utility of the claimed compounds. As I understand Dr. Bartlett's opinion, he begins with Schering's syntheses of SCH 30178 and SCH 30928. The spiro ring of SCH 30178 would occupy a different region of space than the fused 6,5 ring of SCH 30928. Since both of these compounds were shown to have ACE inhibition, Schering had evidence that the ACE active site is very tolerant of different structures at the proline site of captopril analogues. Using computer-modeling techniques, Dr. Bartlett mapped the spatial requirements of a number of moieties to show that compounds with useful levels of ACE inhibition could fit within the dimensional regions carved out by SCH 30178 and SCH 30928. Such models included compounds with", "cis", "and", "trans", "substituted moieties and compounds with spirocyclic and fused bicyclic ring structures.

In the semi-annual report of January 2, 1980, there is reference to the Squibb hypothesis. However, as confirmed by Dr. Smith, there is no description in that document of the volume, space or dimension that might explain how the Cushman-Ondetti model assisted the Schering scientists with their prediction. Similarly, the July 3, 1980 report contains only a passing remark of a \"binding hypothesis\". Dr. Smith, in her oral testimony, expanded substantially on this small reference:", "\"A. I have a hypothesis of where these groups would fit and, remember, it's a hypothesis, and in this day and age, when I look at projects like this and you would crystallize something out into an active site and you would be able to view it and see where things fit.

Omission of this important explanation from any of the relevant reporting documents leads me to an inference that, at the time period in question, it was not in the thinking of the Schering scientists. I find that the spatial notion of Cushman-Ondetti model was not relied on in any material way to predict the activity of the compounds being explored by Schering in 1980 to 1981.

One example would be the R,S,S(S,S) component of the SCH 31925 mixture, which was a stereoisomer with an R configuration at the carboethoxy position that falls within Claim 12. Although this compound would have come within the volume carved out by Dr. Bartlett's hypothesis, the combined inactivity of other compounds with an R configuration at the carboethoxy position (i.e. SCH 31847, 32457 and 31924) taught that the R,S,S,(S,S) stereoisomer would have been inactive", "in vivo", ".

The first is that the doctrine of sound prediction does not extend as far as proposed by Apotex; rather, the sufficiency requirement set out in the", "Patent", "Act", "protects a third party from patents that provide inadequate disclosure of how the patent is to be practised.

Considerable jurisprudence has developed that reinforces the sufficiency requirement (see, for example, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at 517). The material date for determining the sufficiency of a specification is the publication date of the patent. The \"bargain\" that is struck between the inventor and the public exists only from the date of the grant. Until then, the inventor has limited rights to protect his invention and the public cannot expect to acquire any rights in the bargain.

During that period of time, the advances in chemistry - both as to known methodology and sophistication of equipment - made the synthesis and separation of the compounds of the compounds of Claim 12 viable on a large commercial scale.

I begin by reviewing what methods, beyond Example 20, might have been known to a person skilled in the art as of October 20, 1981 that could have been used to synthesize the Claim 12 compounds.

He described 15 alternative synthetic models all of which he opined were \"based upon well-established literature reactions that were known before 1980\".

He also acknowledged that fractional crystallization techniques were known in 1980, even though some trial and error would be required.

If the proposed method contains a sound line of reasoning and includes steps that would be known to the skilled - but unimaginative - chemist, then I am not prepared to reject it simply because it is a \"paper exercise\". After all, the root concept of sound prediction is that something has not been done but, on close inspection, can be predicted to work in the fashion expected by the patent.

The first is that the Court's analysis of the validity of the patent at issue was not \"strictly necessary\"; the Court had already concluded that the defence of non-infringement had been made out ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at p. 191). Accordingly, the Court's comments on invalidity, including those on the best method requirement must be considered as obiter. Secondly, it appears that the patent in issue disclosed a practice that was in direct contradiction to how one would actually implement the invention. The patent, in that case, dealt with the method for producing compressor blades. The patent specification explicitly disclosed that the invention eliminated the need to clamp on the root portion of the compressor blade.

The surfactant used in the examples of the patent is sodium lawryl sulfate which has been used for decades as a solubilizer of hard to dissolve active ingredients (such as diltiazem) in capsule or tablets. The role of surfactant is to solubilize the active ingredient.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "b) Claim 1 of the '224 patent  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[39]", "Even though a surfactant is clearly an essential element, the second part of the analysis, whether the Rhoxal microgranule infringes the '224 patent, remains. The NOA alleges that the Rhoxal product does not contain a surfactant within the meaning of the patent because of its location. The role of the surfactants within the capsules is also important to this determination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[40]", "Rhoxal makes three main arguments as to why the presence of two admitted surfactants, polysorbate and nonoxynol do not infringe the '224 patent. The first argument relates to the distance between the surfactant and the active layer, and the second to the theory of migration of surfactants. A third argument is based on the role of polysorbate and nonoxynol within Rhoxal's capsules.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "i) Proximity of the surfactant  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[41]", "Rhoxal alleges that Claim 1 is not infringed because of the proximity between the location of the surfactant and the active layer.

Rhoxal submits that both the polysorbate and the nonoxynol are contained in the outer SR layer, and not in the active layer.

Biovail argues that the polysorbate and the nonoxynol have clearly been added to the Rhoxal formulation to aid in the release of the active ingredient, and to function as surfactants. The applicant Biovail provided some evidence that the addition of polysorbate to the SR layer could aid in the release of the active ingredient. (See paragraph 11 of the present decision)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[43]", "The proximity argument is effective for Rhoxal, with respect to Claim 1. A plain and clear reading of the claim shows that the surfactant, for Claim 1, was intended to be in the active layer. Also, the patent provides eight examples to illustrate the invention. They all refer to the surfactant as being located within the active layer. It is also of significance that out of 36 claims, 34 of them expressly require the surfactant to be located within the active layer. There is also expert evidence that explains that the surfactant is always in the inner active layer as opposed to the SR layer because in Dr. Weiner's opinion, the purpose of the invention is to replace the use of an organic acid with another mechanism which promotes the dissolution of diltiazem. In the present case, surfactant is a part of the active layer in a sufficient amount to solubilize and release diltiazem (see Rhoxal's Motion Record, tab 8, page 592).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[44]", "The expert for Biovail, Dr. Mathiowitz, was unable to contradict the idea that, for Claim 1, the surfactant had to be placed in the active layer of the microgranule. Dr. Mathiowitz is uncertain of whether the surfactant must be in the active layer to be effective, but does agree that, for the purposes of Claim 1, the surfactant must be in the active layer to be described by the claim (see Rhoxal's Motion Record, Tab 6 page 310 and Tab 8, page 398). It is admitted by Biovail that the Rhoxal capsule does not contain any surfactant in its active layer. Therefore, there cannot be an infringement of Claim 1 of the '224 patent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "ii) The theory of migration of surfactants  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[45]", "In addition, Biovail submits that the surfactants migrate into the active layer after ingestion, and that it infringes the Claim 1 of the '224 patent. In contrast, Rhoxal submits that Claim 1 does not cover a capsule where the surfactant migrates into the active layer after ingestion. Rhoxal is of the opinion that there is no evidence that the surfactants in the Rhoxal capsule indeed migrate in such a fashion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[46]", "For the sake of clarity, this theory of migration whereby the polysorbate and the nonoxynol located in the SR layer of the Rhoxal capsule would migrate to the inner active layer to liberate the diltiazem cannot be found anywhere in the '224 patent. Except for claims 35, 36 which will be discussed below, all of the claims, disclosure and examples refer to surfactant being located in the active layer. In addition to the absence of an explanation in scientific terms as to the concept of migration (comments will be made in the following paragraphs), the patent does not refer in any way to migration. Therefore, such migration of the surfactant is not covered by Claim 1.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[47]", "I would also like to add that the evidence clearly shows that the amount of polysorbate and nonoxynol in the Rhoxal capsule is minimal in comparison with the amount of surfactant contained in the '224 patent and that there is credible evidence indicating that such minimal amount would not have the capacity to solubilize the active ingredient. I agree with Dr. Weiner's opinion that it would take considerably more polysorbate and nonoxynol to reach the threshold level of concentration to dissolve the diltiazem (see Rhoxal's Record, first cross-examination of Dr. Weiner, tab I-4 at pages 179, 187 to 188 and page 191). The migration theory shows that there would be dilution of the surfactants as they travel from the SR layer to the inner active layer and such minimal amount cannot become an effective soluble agent of the diltiazem if, and when, it reaches the inner layer. Dr. Weiner's explanation on this point was convincing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "iii) The role of the surfactants  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[48]", "Finally, the evidence indicates that polysorbate and nonoxynol are in the SR layer in minimal amounts to act respectively as a bioavailability adjuvant and an emulsifier, not as surfactants. The role of polysorbate is to ensure that the coating is distributed evenly over the microgranule. Dr. Mathiowitz in her cross-examination said that she would not be surprised if polysorbate used in the Rhoxal capsule was used for such purpose (See Rhoxal's Record, volume 6 at page 320). The Record also shows that nonoxynol is being used in small quantities as an emulsifier. (See Biovail's Record, volume 4, Tab B, 18 NN).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[49]", "In conclusion, I am of the opinion that the Rhoxal capsule does not infringe Claim 1 of the '224 patent for the following reasons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- The presence of surfactant is an essential component of claim 1 of the '224 patent;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- The location of surfactant within the active layer is also an essential element of the '224 patent;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- There is no justification in the '224 patent for the inclusion of a migration theory whereby the surfactant in a minimal amount in the SR layer would travel to the active layer and solubilize the diltiazem;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- The evidence shows that the polysorbate's role in Rhoxal's capsules is to act as a bioavailability adjuvant while nonoxynol's role is to act as an emulsifier.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "c) Claims 35, 36 of the patent  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[50]", "Claims 35 and 36 of the '224 patent cannot be treated in the same way as Claim 1.

There are no references as to the use of the surfactant in a different way than using it within the inner active layer. The process followed to arrive at the Biovail capsule shows that the surfactant is located within the inner active layer. Coherence and consistency are qualities applicable to the understanding of a patent.

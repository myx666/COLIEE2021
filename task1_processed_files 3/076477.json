Lilly argues that it is entitled to the higher amount as the issues in this case were complex and substantial work was undertaken, as is evidenced by the volume of materials filed. It also notes that this application concerned Cialis, which it terms a \"blockbuster\" drug, and argues that by reason of the drug involved, a higher costs award is appropriate because the outcome of the case was of significant importance. Apotex counters by noting that Lilly agreed on costs in the earlier case of", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED at the mid-point of Column IV of Tariff B to the", "Rules", "and asserts that as the issues in this case were substantially similar to those decided in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "this case is of lesser complexity as it was the second time Lilly argued several of the issues (and retained the same experts in respect of them).

This is where costs in this type of application are often set (see, for example,", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED; and", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). Indeed, the fact that Lilly agreed to the mid-point of Column IV in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "is evidence of this being the appropriate level for costs. In addition, while I agree that the case was of importance given the drug involved, this was the second time that Lilly argued many of the same issues that arose in this case.

Lilly says that by proceeding in this fashion Apotex forced Lilly to go to the expense of preparing evidence on the dropped issues. Lilly also claims that it needed to address the dropped issues in its Memorandum, which required it to abbreviate its argument on the issues that Apotex actually relied on in the context of these proceedings (which Apotex was free to discuss at greater length in its own Memorandum). Lilly says that Apotex's conduct in this regard warrants increasing assessable fees by 25%."], ["[8]", "The issues that Apotex raised, but did not pursue were the following:", "1. The allegation that the 784 Patent (the patent in suit in this case) was not entitled to claim priority from the previous British patent filed in respect of Cialis;", "2. The allegation that the invention disclosed and claimed in the 377 Patent (a related patent) was not entitled to claim priority from the previous British patent filed in respect of the same invention;", "3. Allegations that the 784 Patent was invalid due to lack of utility and lack of sound prediction;", "4.

Allegations that Dr. Daugan was not the inventor of the 784 Patent but, rather, that the invention was made by researchers at Vanderbilt University or by Pfizer, in respect of which Apotex purported in its NOA to rely on admissions it claims Lilly had made in previous litigation involving Pfizer;", "8. The allegation that additional information was not included in the 784 Patent that demonstrated the use of tadalafil was preferred relative to the use of Compound B for the treatment of erectile dysfunction or, alternatively, that the use of Compound B was to be avoided; and", "9. The allegation that the inventor was aware of information in respect of the use of the claimed compounds, including tadalafil and Compound B, for the treatment of erectile dysfunction that does not form part of the specification as filed."], ["[9]", "Lilly also alleges that several of these claims are akin to claims of fraud, which it says merits a further increase of the assessable costs by an additional 33%.

In addition, as concerns the allegations that Lilly impugns as being fraudulent, Apotex says that the claims it made in this case are fundamentally different from allegations under section 53 of the", "Patent Act", "as it did not here allege that the misstatements made in the Patent were made wilfully. Apotex submits that the essence of fraud is that a false statement be made wilfully with an intent to mislead, as was noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED."], ["[11]", "I agree with Apotex on the final point and find there to be a meaningful difference between the allegations it made in this case and those made in cases under section 53 of the", "Patent Act", ". A claim under section 53 of the", "Patent Act", "involves the assertion that a patentee made omissions or misstatements in a patent \"wilfully ... for the purposes of misleading\". The claims made by Apotex in this case do not rise to that level. Thus, this situation is distinguishable from those in which this Court has increased costs due to baseless allegations under section 53 of the", "Patent Act", ". I therefore do not believe that Lilly is entitled to a multiplier on this basis."], ["[12]", "I also find no basis for the award of a multiplier due to the number of issues Apotex did not pursue in its Memorandum.

I agree with Apotex that the weakness of these claims became most apparent after Justice de Montigny dismissed similar claims in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "in January of 2015, shortly before the memoranda were filed in this case. I therefore do not believe that the dropping of a number of issues should give rise to increased costs in this case. I find that this situation is somewhat similar to that in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, aff'd 2012 FCA 265, relied on by Apotex, where Justice Snider noted at para 10 that, absent a clear abuse of process, a party should not be penalized for dropping arguments after hearing the evidence."], ["[13]", "I therefore decline to exercise my discretion to award a multiplier in this case.", "III.", "Claims under items 1, 24 and 27 of the Tariff"], ["[14]", "Lilly has claimed under item 1 for each of the materials it was required to prepare and under item 24 of the Tariff for travel in respect of all the cross-examinations that were conducted.

Travel for all other cross-examinations, however, may be separately claimed."], ["[17]", "Finally, I see no reason why Lilly should not claim compensation under item 27 for preparation of a Bill of Costs, as this work was undertaken and does not necessarily fall under item 26.", "IV.", "Disbursements"], ["[18]", "Apotex has contested that amounts claimed by several of Lilly's experts (which in some cases appear to exceed $1000.00 per hour) and in reply Lilly has conceded that it would be appropriate to limit expert fees at the amount charged by senior counsel for similar time involvement, as has been done in other cases (see, for example,", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED).

I am satisfied, based on the affidavits filed by Lilly, that its lawyers would bill for all the copy costs that it seeks to recover and determine that the amount of 25 cents per page copied for the materials filed is reasonable. I thus find the amount claimed under this rubric to be allowable."], ["[20]", "Likewise, I determine that the amounts claimed by Lilly for hotels, airfare and meals are reasonable and therefore recoverable.

After that time, at least the immediate utility of even a dedicated terrorist will seriously have been disrupted. The terrorist will know that the authorities will retain an interest in his or her activities and contacts, and will be likely to scrutinize them in the future. For those organising terrorism, a person who has been subject to a control order for up to two years is an unattractive operator, who may be assumed to have the eyes and ears of the State upon him/her. Nevertheless, the material I have seen justifies the conclusion there are a few controlees who, despite the restrictions placed upon them, manage to maintain some contact with terrorist associates and/or groups, and a determination to become operational in the future.\""], ["[81]", "The passage of time must be taken into account when the Court is assessing which conditions are necessary to neutralize the danger posed by the judicial release of an individual named in a certificate.

Both of those decisions found that the length of time in detention resulted in the interruption of relationships with extremist groups. As a consequence, the passage of time was held to be a factor that diminishes the danger associated with the release of an individual. In clear terms, the Supreme Court stated at paragraph 112 that the longer the period of incarceration, the less an individual is susceptible to remain a danger.

He has been judicially released under conditions for nearly three years."], ["[83]", "The fact of having been a person subject to the interest and control of Canadian authorities for more than a decade has had an impact on the danger that his release may pose to national security. Mr. Harkat's social and professional contacts have been disrupted. The limitations imposed by the conditions of release on communication by land-line telephone, cellular phone, and internet paired with the interception of telecommunications and mail has severely limited the possibility of contact with individuals, whether internationally, nationally or locally.

This Court also wonders, for example, who would approach such an individual with such a high media profile? How could an organization consider asking somebody with such a high profile to undertake secret activities? The Court does not have an answer to these questions, but they are obvious questions in the mind of a decision maker who must assess the danger posed by an individual released under conditions aimed at neutralizing such danger. Proportionality is an instrument that requires the adaptation of the two factors (danger and conditions) to a changing reality. Circumstances are not frozen; they evolve over time."], ["[87]", "A last comment: this Court is conscious of the lengthy nature of this process. When will these procedures come to a close? The ultimate objective of the Ministers is the removal of Mr. Harkat from Canada. Before this may occur many procedural steps must be taken. The end is not yet in sight.

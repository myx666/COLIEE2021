The applicant argues the tribunal adopted a static perspective which requires there exists a fully developed parent-child relationship between the applicant and her adopted twin daughters at the time of the application for permanent residence in Canada. Such a view, according to the applicant, runs contrary to common sense where there is an international adoption because the relationship between the parent and child will not have the opportunity to fully develop until the parent and child can be together as a family. This view is also contrary to Citizenship and Immigration Canada's own handbook entitled \"International Adoption and the Immigration Process (1997)\".

Most, if not all of the applicant's written submissions, reached back to the interviews the visa officer held with the twins in August 2001. She argued the interviews were unfair for a number of reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "However, during oral argument, counsel for the applicant focussed on the testimony she gave before the tribunal and in her affidavit in support of her judicial review proceeding. She argued the tribunal ignored the evidence she gave on (1) what motivated her to adopt the twins - Kenyan cultural values, large families and her desire to want another family now that her own children were grown up; (2) her evidence that after the adoption in 1999, she took all of the responsibility for their education and welfare while they were in boarding school in Meru, the town where they were born and where their natural mother and siblings live; (3) her control of the twins' lives when they moved to Nairobi in August 2001 and where they are still residing; and (4) the fact she communicates with her adopted daughters several times a month.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "E.

They had been living with the brother who was getting married and unable to continue to provide for them. The visa officer turned down the sponsorship because he was of the view the children were adopted for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada. The Appeal Division found there was little evidence of a genuine parent and child relationship holding that Mr. & Mrs. Perera were a caring uncle and aunt who wished to bring the boys to Canada so that they may complete their education. The Appeal Division found in that case there had been no attempt to separate them from their natural mother and, indeed, said they continued to live with her and regard her as their mother.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "Justice Dubé set aside the Appeal Division's decision because \"it has adopted an improper concept of 'genuine parent and child relationship'.\" Justice Dubé said this at paragraph 13 of his reasons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"¶ 13 Moreover, the Appeal Division has adopted an improper concept of 'genuine parent and child relationship' in suggesting that the adopting parents' desire to bring the boys to Canada and provide them with a better life and education is contradictory to the establishment of a genuine parent and child relationship. Contrary to the Appeal Division's understanding of the definition of the term 'adopted', the words 'genuine parent and child relationship' do not require that there existed a fully developed parent and child relationship between the adoptive parents and the children at the time of a sponsored application. More often than not, the genuine relationship is created as a result of the adoption. The mere fact that adoptive parents want to bring their adopted children with them to the country where they live is not a presumption that they are attempting to create an adoption of convenience. Canadian parents fly all over the world to find and adopt children. Surely, visa officers will not close the door to these children because genuine parental relationships have not yet been created. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "He expanded his thinking at paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of his reasons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"¶15 Obviously, the two adopted children still live with their natural mother because they are not allowed to join their adopted parents in Canada. Again, if an adoption is to create a genuine relationship between new parents and adopted children, such a creation is not defined by the past but by the future about to happen as a result of the adoption. The International Adoption and the Immigration Process published by the Government of Canada deals with the sponsorship and defines as follows 'Who May Be Sponsored':  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "'Children under the age of 19 may be sponsored to come to Canada if they have been adopted outside Canada according to the laws of another country. The application for permanent residence will be approved if the visa officer believes there is a genuine parent-child relationship being created as a result of the adoption. The application for permanent residence may be refused if the visa officer concludes that the real purpose of the adoption is to circumvent immigration requirements.'  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"¶ 16 The words 'a genuine parent and child relationship being created as a result of the adoption' are pregnant with significance. They point to a future relationship to be created, not to the confirmation of a present situation. An adoption is a forward looking relationship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"¶ 17 In the instant case, the applicant and his wife have taken deliberate steps to establish a parent and child relationship. First, in 1998, the Pereras went to Sri Lanka to visit their families and found that Mrs. Perera's sister had difficulty rising her three children after the death of her husband. They then decided to adopt their two nephews with the consent of the children's mother. Second, they took the necessary steps in Sri Lanka to complete the adoption of their nephews. Third, they appeared before Citizenship and Immigration Canada and the Ministry for Children Families in British Columbia to complete the adoption. Fourth, Mr. Perera brought considerable financial assistance to the nephew's family. Fifth, they are willing and eager to bring the two children to their home in Canada and to afford them good education and a future in this country. This is not an adoption of convenience but a genuine relationship being created. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[32]", "He was referred to Justice Muldoon's decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).

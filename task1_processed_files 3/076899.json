In my view, the evidence regarding the all but completed negotiations with Pillsbury (another opposition proceeding vis-Ã -vis the respondents' application for registration of the trademark PIZZA FINGERS) persuades me that the respondents would suffer considerable prejudice if the time for filing an appeal were now extended.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[2]", "Secondly, the evidence does not disclose any good reason for the delay [see footnote 2]; the evidence does not demonstrate why the two month time limit allowed for the commencement of appeals was inadequate (two months is a generous time limit when compared with other similar appeal periods [see footnote 3].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "The fact that the applicant appeared for himself on the opposition proceedings and was not represented by a lawyer does not justify an extension of time in this case, particularly not a six week period as is sought here. The fact that the applicant acted for himself, particularly when the applicant communicated with counsel prior to the expiry of the appeal period to indicate an intention to appeal, is not a compelling reason to exercise the court's discretion to grant an extension. There is nothing indicating that the applicant was not aware of the two month time limit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "In addition, the affidavit material which has been filed does not establish that there is any reason to think that the appeal would have a reasonable chance of success on the merits. The only argument made concerning the merits, or lack thereof, rests on the fact that the applicant represented himself at the opposition hearings. I do not think that this is sufficient to establish that the appeal has merit. Most importantly, to reiterate, no good reason for the delay has been demonstrated.", "Order  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The application will accordingly be dismissed.

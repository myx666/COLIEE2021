The first statement is understandable without knowing the context, and is an obvious fact of life. However, the second statement requires cautious application. It can be fairly argued that the statement might apply in some or most claims, but whether it applies in any given claim depends upon an evaluation of the context in which that particular claim arises.

It is within the context of a claim based on fear of terrorism that the words in statement [3] have meaning.

The same test applies to the help that a woman might be expected to receive at the complaint counter at a local police station.

Thus, evidence of the failure of state authorities to", "effectively", "respond to requests from women for protection from violent sexual predators, exclusive of all other evidence, can be found to constitute some clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption of state protection.

Greater media attention to this phenomenon in recent years has revealed both its prevalence and its horrific impact on women from all walks of life. Far from protecting women from it the law historically sanctioned the abuse of women within marriage as an aspect of the husband's ownership of his wife and his 'right' to chastise her. One need only recall the centuries old law that a man is entitled to beat his wife with a stick 'no thicker than his thumb'.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Laws do not spring out of a social vacuum. The notion that a man has a right to 'discipline' his wife is deeply rooted in the history of our society. The woman's duty was to serve her husband and to stay in the marriage at all costs 'till death do us part' and to accept as her due any 'punishment' that was meted out for failing to please her husband. One consequence of this attitude was that 'wife battering' was rarely spoken of, rarely reported, rarely prosecuted, and even more rarely punished. Long after society abandoned its formal approval of spousal abuse tolerance of it continued and continues in some circles to this day.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Fortunately, there has been a growing awareness in recent years that no man has a right to abuse any woman under any circumstances. Legislative initiatives designed to educate police, judicial officers and the public, as well as more aggressive investigation and charging policies all signal a concerted effort by the criminal justice system to take spousal abuse seriously. However, a woman who comes before a judge or jury with the claim that she has been battered and suggests that this may be a relevant factor in evaluating her subsequent actions still faces the prospect of being condemned by popular mythology about domestic violence. Either she was not as badly beaten as she claims or she would have left the man long ago.

The presumption is not a great leap. Having established the existence of a fear and a state's inability to assuage those fears, it is not assuming too much to say that the fear is well-founded. Of course, the persecution must be real -- the presumption cannot be built on fictional events -- but the", "well-foundedness", "of the fears can be established through the use of such a presumption.

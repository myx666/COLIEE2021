The Minister therefore did not have any firm evidence that would enable him to conclude, as the applicant today claims, that this effectively was a [translation] \"ship, boat or craft designed or used as a sea-going vessel or on inland waters\". It should also be noted that on May 16, DATE_SUPPRESSED, no specific information about the construction of the floating structure was available when the ministerial order was issued, so the physical description provided by Mr. Doyon in his inspection report, which is based on his personal observations, seems reasonable to me in this case. Moreover, the applicant's affidavits do not contain any specific description or information about the use of the floating structure, other than to designate it as a [translation] \"pontoon boat\" measuring less than seven metres in length."], ["[20]", "But the applicant remains determined: the Act does not allow the ministerial interpretation. Only a \"vessel\" can be a [translation] \"ship, boat or craft\". By the same logic, the Marina's docks B and D are \"vessels\". In support of his interpretation of the Act, the applicant refers to the comments by Justice Noël in a related case, where the Court refused to summarily strike out a pleading by the applicant:", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED.

At the risk of repeating myself, the issue is not whether the applicant's floating structure can be called a ship when it is moved, but whether a floating platform that is anchored and moored can be designated as a work. But if we want to proceed by analogies, the overall approach used by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED provides an opposite argument. The British Columbia Court of Appeal states that in order to determine whether an object is a \"ship\" or a \"vessel\" within the meaning of the", "Canada Shipping Act,", "RSC 1985, c S-9, the decision-maker must look at the definition in the Act, the object's physical characteristics, its previous use and the owner's intent. In fact, in that case, the British Columbia Court of Appeal determined that a floating barge anchored to a dock was not a ship. The same Court noted that physically, the barge had the characteristics of a ship, and was designed for navigation, but was not used for navigation, and the owner's intent was to have it remain in place indeterminately. The applicant provides other pertinent examples. In", "Thomas c. Todorovic", ", 2013 QCCS 2807 at paragraph 36, the Quebec Superior Court concluded that a buoy attached by a rope to a boat was not a ship under the FCA, and in", "Beaulne c.

As I said earlier, the intent is often the determinant, and I do not see how the applicant's floating structure can be designated a \"vessel\" without evidence of intent."], ["[23]", "In this case, I am satisfied that the ministerial designation as an [translation] \"unauthorized work\" is consistent with the evidence and the purpose of the Act, which is to protect the public right to navigation.

On the one hand, this definition is not exhaustive, as is evident from the phrase \"'work' includes\". On the other hand, there is no clear indication that a ship, boat or craft is excluded from the definition of a work.

In this regard, the applicant is of the view that the ministerial order was issued because the approval of Dock B was about to be granted, and the applicant's pontoon needed to be removed so that the Marina could install Dock B. The applicant also alleges that the officer had prejudged the matter of the removal of the unapproved work, which is apparent from the fact that he observed the facts from the Marina grounds, which he used as the approximate coordinates, and that he immediately decided that the applicant's work had to be removed. According to the applicant, there is no reason why the Marina should have had more rights than the applicant, who is the exclusive occupant of this parcel of land, and yet the Minister clearly favoured the Marina to the detriment of the applicant. The applicant states that there was no urgent need to remove the floating structure because it did not constitute an obstruction to navigation, and that he had the necessary buoys and lights to make it visible."], ["[33]", "The respondent submits that the applicant did not meet the burden of demonstrating that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias. The Marina had already filed an application to install its work, Dock B. This in itself is a neutral fact. No conclusions can be drawn from this evidence. Even if the applicant is the exclusive occupant of the river bed, which is contested by the respondent, this has nothing to do with the issue of bias.

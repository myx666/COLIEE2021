J'ai aussi tenu compte des observations, en portant une attention particulière à l'interprétation de la décision de la SPR proposée par l'avocat du défendeur."], ["[35]", "J'estime que l'interprétation de la décision de la SPR que l'avocat du défendeur a proposée n'est pas étayée par la preuve. Bien que la proposition de l'avocat pourrait permettre de tirer une juste conclusion de droit d'appartenance à un groupe social ou d'établir un lien avec le motif des opinions politiques prévu à l'article 96 de la LIPR, j'estime que ce n'est pas le cas en l'espèce. À la différence de la décision rendue par la Cour fédérale dans", "Canada", "(Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 532, au paragraphe 19, dans la présente affaire, les motifs de la SPR ne permettent pas au défendeur d'affirmer que la décision de la SPR ne reposait pas uniquement sur l'appartenance à un groupe social particulier."], ["[36]", "Je ne décèle rien dans les motifs de la SPR qui constitue un fondement juridique légitime permettant de tirer la conclusion de l'appartenance à un groupe social, outre le fait que la SPR estime qu'il s'agit d'un lien valable, et rien non plus n'y justifie selon moi d'établir un lien avec le motif des opinions politiques, comme le suggère le répondant."], ["[37]", "Les motifs comprennent plus de six conclusions, comme il a été mentionné, mais la SPR ne relie aucune d'elle aux considérations juridiques dont il faut nécessairement tenir compte lorsqu'une conclusion repose sur l'appartenance à un groupe social particulier. La Cour ne peut émettre des hypothèses sur le raisonnement qui sous-tend la décision de la SPR dans cette affaire. Il y a absence de lien et il est impossible d'en établir un. Par conséquent, la décision est déraisonnable."], ["[38]", "Compte tenu de ce qui précède, il ne m'apparaît pas nécessaire de me pencher sur la deuxième question, à savoir que la SPR aurait omis de tenir compte d'éléments de preuve essentiels. J'aimerais toutefois souligner que la SPR disposait des éléments de preuve suivants: 1) le texte intégral du discours du secrétaire de la Défense du Sri Lanka, daté d'août 2011, dans lequel il associe le MS", "Sun Sea", "aux TLET et fait état de la présence d'un grand nombre de « cadres des TLET » à bord, et 2) l'affidavit d'un consultant en immigration daté du 30 janvier 2012 selon lequel un passager du MS", "Sun Sea", "qui est retourné au Sri Lanka a été détenu et torturé depuis l'été 2011. De tels éléments de preuve doivent être pris en compte dans l'évaluation de la situation d'un passager du MS", "Sun Sea", "qui retourne dans son pays d'origine."], ["[39]", "Les parties n'ont proposé aucune question aux fins de certification, et aucune question ne sera certifiée.", "JUGEMENT"], ["[40]", "LA COUR STATUE que", "la demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision de la SPR datée du 31 août 2012 est accueillie, et l'affaire sera renvoyée à un tribunal différemment constitué pour qu'il procède à un nouvel examen.

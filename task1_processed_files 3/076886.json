For its part, AstraZeneca focuses its motivation submissions on two main components: (ii) first, it argues that the prior art revealed that a number of quetiapine's characteristics made it a \"poor candidate\" for a sustained release formulation, thus teaching away from the invention; and (iii) second, it posits that there were a number of possible formulations that could have been chosen and that the skilled person would not have been specifically motivated to choose HPMC as a gelling agent.", "(i) Frequency of Dosing"], ["[52]", "Teva submits that both a general and specific motive existed in the prior art to create a sustained release formulation, namely to reduce dosing frequency. The Court has already found that the skilled person would know that less frequent dosing - meaning BID or QD over TID or QID - was beneficial for compliance. Teva relies on the Gefvert article to show that there was a specific motive to decrease the dosing frequency of quetiapine: \"Given the importance of compliance with medication in schizophrenics, a more convenient dose regimen would be beneficial\" (see Applicants' Hearing Compendium Part 2B: No Motivation, Tab 48). I find this evidence compelling."], ["[53]", "In its oral reply submissions, AstraZeneca challenged Teva's reliance on Gefvert to point to a specific motivation to dose quetiapine less frequently because (i) the article was not relied on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's NOA, and (ii) the argument was not raised in its memorandum. It is well-established that a second person (i.e. Teva) \"cannot, in proceedings taken in Court, present argument and evidence relating to an issue that is outside the scope of its NOA\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 287 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 40;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] FCJ No 270 at para 25). Furthermore, the second party may not \"shift ground or raise a new ground during the legal proceedings that has not been raised in its NOA\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 40;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] FCJ No 1848 at paras 70-71)."], ["[54]", "I am satisfied, after reviewing the NOAs, that the issue of a specific motive to create a sustained release version of quetiapine was squarely raised in the NOAs (see AR Vol 3, Tab 3 at p 706 and Tab 4 at p 772;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 688 (aff'd 2010 FCA 242, reversed 2012 SCC 60 on other grounds) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 95). Furthermore, it is settled law that a second person may respond to matters raised by an applicant in NOC proceedings (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] FCJ No 386, [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 48; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 95-96). Such a response does not constitute an expansion of the legal and factual basis of the NOA ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 48). I note that Dr. Seeman, one of AstraZeneca's witnesses, referred to the Gefvert paper in his affidavit (see Applicants' Hearing Compendium Part 2B: No Motivation, Tab 49, Affidavit of Philip Seeman, M.D., Ph.D.). Teva was thus well within its rights to respond to Gefvert in its submissions."], ["[55]", "Finally, I cannot accept AstraZeneca's argument that Teva raised this argument for the first time in its oral argument. The issue of less frequent dosing as a motive was indeed canvassed  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's written submissions at paragraphs 67 through 76. While Teva does not appear to have relied on Gefvert for this specific proposition, the rules about raising new arguments pertain to shifting or raising new grounds for relief, and not to relying on evidence which is already in the record to support a ground that is already in issue.", "(ii) Quetiapine's Pharmacokinetic Properties"], ["[56]", "In its effort to demonstrate that Teva's allegations of invalidity are not justified, AstraZeneca points to five characteristics of quetiapine that would have de-motivated the person skilled in the art from trying a sustained release formulation of the drug: (a) large dose size; (b) solubility; (c) partition coefficient; (d) extent of metabolism; and (e) duration of action. I am not convinced that any of these properties taught away from a sustained release formulation. The person skilled in the art would not have viewed them as \"lions in the path\", but rather as paper tigers, to use the language of Lord Justice Jacob in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Pat).", "(a)", "Dose Size"], ["[57]", "AstraZeneca argues that, because quetiapine was a \"weak antipsychotic\", a large dose size would necessitate a large and uncomfortable-to-swallow tablet. Its argument is based on the assumption that a dose closer to 750 mg would be necessary in order for the tablet to exhibit antipsychotic efficacy. However, as already established, quetiapine was shown to be effective at doses as low as 300 mg. I am further convinced that, even were a 750 mg dose required, the person skilled in the art would have been motivated to split the dose into two smaller tablets to be taken at once. At the very least, this would not have constituted a lion in the path of the skilled person.", "(b)", "pH Solubility"], ["[58]", "The arguments with respect to quetiapine's solubility are related to its pH profile. AstraZeneca maintains that neither of these was a known property at the relevant time, and that the person skilled in the art would have been de-motivated by this want of knowledge. As already established, determining these properties would have been routine. Furthermore, the Dow brochure revealed that: \"The viscosity of the gel which forms on the tablet surface and the rate of hydration are relatively independent of the pH environment. Release rates of drugs will not be affected by pH unless drug solubility varies greatly over the normal pH range\" (see Compendium (Volume 3) of Teva Canada Limited, Tab 85, Affidavit of Dr. Ping Lee at para 171). Dr. Prud'homme confirmed in his cross-examination that the skilled person would have been using the Dow brochures, reference being made to them even in patents filed at the time (see Compendium (Volume 3) of Teva Canada Limited, Tab 85, Cross-Examination of Dr. Robert Prud'homme at question 1024). I am thus not satisfied that the pH solubility of quetiapine would have de-motivated the skilled person from pursuing a sustained release formulation of the drug.", "(c)", "Partition Coefficient"], ["[59]", "The partition coefficient of quetiapine was also unknown at the relevant time. I am again satisfied that determining this particular property of the drug would have been a matter of routine experimentation and would thus not have dissuaded the person skilled in the art from pursuing a sustained release formulation, particularly since it did not appear to cause any problems for the immediate release version of the drug.", "(d)", "Metabolism"], ["[60]", "AstraZeneca argues that quetiapine's extensive metabolism suggested at the relevant time that it may be a poor candidate for a sustained release formulation. This is because the faster a drug is processed by the body, the more of it is needed to achieve the therapeutic blood concentration (see AstraZeneca's Memo at para 66). Despite these concerns, and as previously determined, quetiapine was found to be therapeutically effective in doses around 300 mg. Dr. Prud'homme further confirmed this in his cross-examination (see Compendium (Volume 3) of Teva Canada Limited, Tab 89, Cross-Examination of Dr. Robert Prud'homme at question 717). Dr. Lee noted that, if the extensive metabolism of quetiapine was not problematic for the immediate release version, that it would not have been expected to cause a problem in the sustained release version (see Compendium (Volume 3) of Teva Canada Limited, Tab 88, Affidavit of Dr. Ping Lee at para 200). I find this to be a rational characterization, and determine that quetiapine's extensive metabolism would not deter the person skilled in the art from formulating a sustained release version of the drug.", "(e)", "Duration of Action"], ["[61]", "AstraZeneca argues that a drug with both a large dose and a short half-life would not be well-suited for a sustained release formulation. Its argument on this point is a variation on its large dose size argument, which I have already rejected (see AstraZeneca's Memo at para 67). Furthermore, the fact that quetiapine had a short half-life actually indicated that there would be a motive to make a sustained release formulation (see Compendium (Volume3) of Teva Canada Limited, Tab 90, Affidavit of Dr. Ping Lee at paras 195, 228).", "(iii) Other Formulations"], ["[62]", "The fact that there may have been a number of possible formulations, as posited by AstraZeneca, does not mean that the alleged invention is not obvious ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 100;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 690 at para 79). HPMC was one of the most commonly used gelling agents. This prior art knowledge combined with the relative straightforward manner in which HPMC could be manufactured, discussed above, point to a motive to choose HPMC.", "4. Actual Course of Conduct"], ["[63]", "Additionally, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> instructs that the Court may look, in certain cases, to the actual course of conduct followed by the inventors: \"For example, if the inventor and his or her team reached the invention quickly, easily, directly and relatively inexpensively, in light of the prior art and common general knowledge, that may be evidence supporting a finding of obviousness, unless the level at which they worked and their knowledge base was above what should be attributed to the skilled person\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 71)."], ["[64]", "While not central to my findings on obviousness, I find it telling that AstraZeneca did not lead any evidence with respect to the length or difficulty of the trials conducted, or with respect to whether their inventors possessed a knowledge base that was above that which should be attributed to the skilled person in this case. Satisfied as I am that Teva has given its allegations of invalidity an air of reality, I draw an adverse inference from AstraZeneca's failure to provide evidence on these points.", "Conclusions on Obviousness"], ["[65]", "\"[O]bviousness connotes something which would at once occur to a person skilled in the art who was desirous of accomplishing the end\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 184). The end, or the inventive concept, here is a sustained release formulation of quetiapine with a view to minimizing dose dumping and decreasing dosing frequency. The skilled person would have been led to combine the elements of the prior art to accomplish this end in the following manner: First, the prior art - particularly Gefvert - motivated the skilled person to find the solution the patent addresses (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), which is to decrease dosing frequency and avoiding dose dumping. Second, the prior art clearly taught that sustained release formulations were commonly used to achieve this purpose, HPMC being the most commonly used gelling agent in such formulations, in part because of the relatively straightforward manner in which it could be manufactured. The choice of a sustained release formulation using HPMC would thus have been obvious steps to accomplish the claimed end for quetiapine."], ["[66]", "I conclude that it was more or less self-evident to try to obtain a sustained release formulation of quetiapine using HPMC, and that the person skilled in the art would have had a fair expectation of success. Given my conclusion with respect to the main factors listed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , I find it unnecessary to address the parties' arguments with respect to secondary considerations (i.e. commercial success and unexpected benefits).", "B.", "Ambiguity"], ["[67]", "Further given my conclusions with respect to obviousness, it is not necessary to explore the limited argument and evidence put forward by Teva with respect to ambiguity. It is important to note the comments made by Justice Roger Hughes in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] FCJ No 2155 that it is difficult to find a patent invalid for ambiguity: \"In short, ambiguity is truly a last resort, rarely, if ever, to be used\" (para 53; see also paras 51-52).

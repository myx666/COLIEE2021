Shortly thereafter, they made refugee claims, which were refused in June 2004 on the basis of a lack of credibility and trustworthy evidence, as was their application for leave and judicial review. They filed their H & C application in August 2006. Their pre-removal risk assessment application was initiated in January 2007 and decided at the same time as the H & C application under review. That decision is not challenged.", "III.", "Issues"], ["[3]", "The issues can be summarised as follows:", "a.

Consequently, the decision must be justifiable, transparent and intelligible within the decision-making process ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It should be vacated only if it is perverse, capricious, not based on the evidence or based on an important mischaracterization of material facts. But, on the other hand, a breach of procedural fairness is cause to set the resultant decision aside, unless there is no possible way that another outcome could have been reached."], ["[5]", "Given the discretionary nature of H & C decisions, considerable deference must be accorded to such decisions. Intervention is therefore only warranted if the decision cannot withstand a somewhat probing examination ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).", "Mr. Garcia's Outstanding Criminal Charges"], ["[6]", "At the outset of her decision, the Officer has this to say:", "The applicants present themselves as good members of society", "and point to numerous letters of reference and their participation in volunteer activities to demonstrate this.", "However", "I note that the male applicant is presently before the courts, facing criminal charges, namely, criminal negligence/bodily harm; dangerous operation of a vehicle/bodily harm; assault with a weapon; assault causing bodily harm; fail to stop at an accident/bodily harm.

If the criminal charges had no effect on the result of the application, why mention it? What was the necessity to make such a statement and why suggest that as a result of these criminal charges the applicants would not be \"good members of the society\"?"], ["[9]", "True, the applicants had the obligation to provide all information in order to demonstrate that their personal circumstances warrant exemption from the permanent resident visa requirement and to report any changes to the Officer that the male applicant was facing criminal charges and were given the opportunity to update their H & C submissions. It is also true that the applicants omitted to update their H & C submissions in order to disclose these charges. But we do not know why these charges were not disclosed to the Officer, and we know nothing about these charges except for the fact that they do exist and that as a consequence \"[t] he male applicant is next before the [criminal] court in mid-April 2008\".

The \"fact that [the impugned] decision was contrary to [the Officer's] directives is of great help in assessing whether the decision was an unreasonable exercise\" of the discretion conferred by the IRPA.

Specifically, officers are instructed as follows:", "When considering the H & C decisions, officers must not be concerned with whether or not the conviction makes the applicant inadmissible.

In brief, Justice here does not appear to have been done, as a result of this statement combined to the failure of the Officer to wait for the outcome of the criminal proceedings or at the very least to attempt to ascertain the underlying facts and circumstances of the charges and/or to give the applicants an opportunity to respond. It appears therefore from the Officer's decision and her failure to ascertain or wait for the result of the criminal charges that the Officer was influenced negatively and acted under the prism of pending criminal charges through which she viewed the entire file."], ["[18]", "Such an error is sufficiently important to render the impugned decision unreasonable without the necessity to address the other two issues.

These documents, however, were not substantively addressed in the Decision. A question thus arises as to what, if any, consideration the Board gave to these documents."], ["[24]", "The Respondent aptly observes that the task of this Court is not to reweigh the evidence. The Respondent cites case law, including <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , to suggest the Other Identity Documents and the Canadian Ahmadiyya Documents should be deemed secondary or tertiary identity documents. While the classification of a document as being primary or secondary in nature may assist the Board in the determination of the weight to be given to it, excessive reliance should not be placed such a classification. The purpose of assessing the identification documents is to establish the Applicants' identity. In this assessment, the RPD must independently consider all of the submitted documents, in light of the objective evidence put before it (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[25]", "The Respondent uses <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> as support for its submission that it was reasonable for the Board not to refer specifically to other documents after finding the adults' BCs fraudulent.

As stated by Justice Mary Gleason in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :"], ["[48] ...In my view, provided that there is some evidence to support the Board's identity-related conclusions, provided the RPD offers some reasons for its conclusions (that are not clearly specious) and provided there is no glaring inconsistency between the Board's decision and the weight of the evidence in the record, the RPD's determination on identity warrants deference and will fall within the purview of a reasonable decision. In other words, if these factors pertain, the determination cannot be said to have been made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the evidence.", "..."], ["[28] Lastly, in respect to the Applicant's school certificate and his mother's death certificate, the Court does not agree with the Applicant that the RPD ignored these documents."], ["[29] In its reasons, the RPD expressly stated that the school certificate was a tertiary document that could not reliably be linked to the Applicant (at para 12).

While the RPD in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> expressly referred to the contentious identity documents in its decision, in this case, no reference was made to various key identity documents: although the Board referred briefly to the children's BCs, it did not consider them in any meaningful way."], ["[27]", "I find these facts to bear a greater similarity to those described  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .", "In that case, the RPD had also rejected the claim on the basis of identity and credibility. Justice de Montigny found that while the RPD had deemed some of the Applicant's identity documents fraudulent, namely a birth certificate, university transcript and letter, and arrest warrant, the Board had made no authenticity findings regarding other secondary identification - namely a voter card and driver's licence. The Court granted the application on the basis that both documents pointed to identity legitimacy."], ["[28]", "Likewise, in similarity to Justice de Montigny's finding of overlooked identity documentation, in this case, the children's school documents were presented to the Board - documents which according to the country documentary evidence are reliable identity documents in Bangladesh. These school IDs and school letters, which included parental information that appeared to be consistent with their identity documents, were not mentioned or given any weight in the Decision. It is trite law that the more relevant the evidence, the more important it is for the decision maker to address it in its reasons, especially if it directly contradicts the Board's findings (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As Justice Evans held:"], ["[17] ...the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts. Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact. Moreover, when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion, it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact.", "See also", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."], ["[29]", "Accordingly, this Court finds the Board erred in this case in failing to address in its decision relevant and seemingly key credible identity documentation.

The principal applicant, Gnanaseharan Selliah, had been coersed into supporting the Tamil cause as early as 1987 as a student. He claims to have been arrested on two occasions. In August 1990, he opened a private school at Alaveddy. He claims that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (the LTTE) would visit his school, conduct political classes and recruit members for their party. In October 1995, he moved to Madduvil with his wife and sister and later learned that the Sri Lankan Forces had destroyed his school and home and that his partner had been arrested and murdered by the army for having recruited for the LTTE. He claims that in April 1996, he moved to Vanni, his sister went missing and his brother-in-law and nephew died during an aerial attack by the army. He also claims that his wife, a nurse, was taken by the LTTE to their camp at Maliavi to provide medical services. They both eventually moved to Columbo where he was arrested by Sri Lankan police on suspicion of being involved in an attack by Tamil forces in Bandarawals on October 25, 2000. He was subsequently released upon conditions. The principal applicant's wife claims that while in Columbo, she was stopped by the police, harassed and molested at the police station. The applicants made arrangements to leave the country together."], ["[4]", "The applicants arrived in Canada on November 24, 2000, and claimed protection as Convention refugees. Their claim was based on their Tamil ethnicity and their fear of arrest, interrogation and torture at the hands of the Sri Lankan army. They also feared that they would be forcibly recruited again by the LTTE to work in their camps."], ["[5]", "On May 29, 2001, the Refugee Division determined that the applicants were not credible and rejected their claims for refugee protection. Their application for judicial review of that decision was dismissed on October 2, 2002. The applicants applied for consideration under the Post Determination Refugee Claimants in Canada Class (PDRCC) on December 18, 2001, an application considered under the PRRA process pursuant to the", "IRPA", ".

Those two decisions are the subject of judicial review applications dealt with in these reasons."], ["[6]", "On January 20, 2003, the applicants had submitted additional information, which was received by an immigration officer but was not considered by the officer determining the PRRA and the H&C applications.

The Officer also considered all the personal letters adduced by the applicants in respect to the alleged risks and considered the documentary evidence on the current country conditions in Sri Lanka. She determined that the alleged risks claimed by the applicants had not been adequately established. With respect to the letter written by the principal applicant's sister, stating that the LTTE came and took her husband and are still looking for the applicants, the Officer found that she was not sure who the sister was referring to, since the principal applicant stated in his PIF that his sister's husband and son were killed in an aerial attack.

She found that the principal applicant did not sufficiently explain why police would identify him as a participant in an attack held in Bandarawals on October 25, 2000. As well, the Officer found that the difficulties alleged by his spouse were not supported by any other evidence. As many Tamils live in Columbo and the LTTE has less of a presence there, the Officer was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there was a risk to Ms. Gnanaseharan. She viewed any risk as a general, not a personalized one."], ["[11]", "The Officer referred to an Amnesty International report from 2000 which stated that young Tamils are the high risk group for recruitment, and found that since the principal applicant was above the high risk age and his son was below the target age, they were not at a real risk for recruitment. The Officer also noted from the country documentation that almost 800,000 Sri Lankans were internally displaced in 2001 from the northern part of the Jaffha peninsula. This is the same area the applicants' are from. She also noted that the government resumed sending relief supplies to LTTE controlled areas after an embargo in February 2002.

The LTTE announced a unilateral cease fire and the government did the same in February 2002. Though both parties had violated the agreement, they were committed to coming to a common agreement on how to deal with the LTTE's mandate of a separate state and a positive atmosphere was evolving. The Officer noted that there is now peace and stability in Sri Lanka and the UN Refugee Agency is making its presence known more and more since June 2002. As well, the LTTE and the government went to the negotiating table on September 16, 2002, in Thailand. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in a press release dated November 20, 2002, stated that the UNHCR appealed for a large sum of money to help Sri Lankans return to their homes, noting \"... the needs of the thousands of Sri Lankans already streaming home and the many more people who look ready to follow\".

In addition, she found that a US DOS report dated 2002 stated that the Country's Constitution grants every citizen freedom of movement and this is generally respected by the government. The Officer acknowledged that leaving an LTTE controlled area and trying to move to Columbo is quite difficult and that families were separated because the LTTE did not allow every member to leave at the same time. However, in 1995, the LTTE began allowing people to move more freely into government controlled areas."], ["[14]", "The Officer concluded that the applicants would not suffer a personal objectively identifiable risk, excessive sanctions, or inhumane treatment or torture if returned to Sri Lanka.

The applicants have failed to establish that the Officer ignored this evidence. Further, the applicants' assertion that they would be detained at the airport is based solely on the principal applicant's evidence that he had heard in the news that rejected asylum seekers are often detained and prosecuted for having left without valid passports. Although it may be inferred from the evidence that returnees may be prosecuted for travelling without proper documentation, there is no evidence that returnees to Sri Lanka who are detained are tortured or subjected to persecution. The evidence does establish that asylum seekers are detained for identity purposes and released. I find the applicants' assertion speculative and not supported by the evidence.

The principal applicant suggests that it was his sister-in-law who lost her husband, not his sister.

In my view the Officer's determination in respect to the letter is supported by the evidence. I agree with the respondent's submission that the principal applicant, in this proceeding, is attempting to explain away his inconsistent and confusing evidence adduced before the PRRA Officer. The Officer's conclusion was reasonably open to her on the evidence.

She recognized in her decision sporadic hostilities in certain areas of the country and that both sides had violated the cease fire agreement. She correctly observed that a new government came into power in 2001 with a mandate to revive the peace process, and the cease fire agreement came into affect February 2002. She relied on objective country documentation which reported that progress towards peace was being made. She noted in November 20, 2002, that the UNHCR appealed for a large sum of money to help Sri Lankans return to their homes, and such initiatives had been ongoing for about a year.

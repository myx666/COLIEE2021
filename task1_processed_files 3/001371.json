They claim that Christians in the neighbourhood are harassed by their Muslim neighbours."], ["[4]", "The Applicants say the problems in their neighbourhood started in the autumn of 1998 when a dispute erupted between Muslims and Christians over a property in downtown Nazareth. A Christian church and school had been built on the property, but the Muslims claimed that the property was holy. The Applicants say that tensions flared after Muslims tore down the school and erected a tent on the property. Muslim groups started interfering with Christian prayers, threw stones at Christians leaving their churches, burnt down Christian stores, and harassed many Christian females."], ["[5]", "In respect to their personal lives, the Applicants claim that, beginning in 2000, the whole family was constantly in danger. They claim that they were spit on when they left their house and that the tires on their car were flattened two to three times a week. They say they were unable to go to church on Sundays or special holidays because of the fear of being attacked. They claim that, in 2000, Muna Hitti began receiving threats: Muslims would telephone her or come to the door of her home threatening to attack her sexually. As a result, Muna Hitti was afraid to leave the house. The Applicants also say that Rana Hitti, who was then 10, witnessed the murder of a Muslim woman by her Muslim husband in their neighbourhood. After that, Rana refused to sleep in her own bedroom or walk or play in the neighbourhood."], ["[6]", "The Applicants say the situation became unbearable and, in March 2004, they were forced to sell their apartment at a loss and leave the neighbourhood. Despite moving to a different neighbourhood, the Applicants allege that the harassment of Muna Hitti did not stop."], ["[7]", "The Applicants say they could not go to the police because it would only put them in further danger. Moreover, they say most of the police in their neighbourhood are Muslim and are unable to prevent violent incidents such as shootings and killings.

Counsel representing the claimant then has an opportunity to question the claimant."], ["[10]", "In written submissions and oral arguments, counsel for the Applicants in the present case took the position that Guideline 7 violates the Applicants' right to natural justice and procedural fairness. In particular, because the burden of proof is on the Applicants to establish that they are in need of refugee protection, counsel argued that natural justice requires that the Applicants be allowed to present their case as they see fit. They say that having counsel for the Applicants question after the RPO and the Board member creates problems with regards to the presentation of evidence and may create insurmountable and unfair difficulties in case presentation."], ["[11]", "The Board issued written reasons denying the Applicants' motion on November 30, 2004. Stating that it had considered counsel's arguments and the unique complexities presented by the refugee determination proceedings, the Board found that the order of questioning as set out in Guideline 7 does not infringe the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. The Board also dismissed the Applicants' motion that a different panel of the Board be appointed to hear the Applicants' refugee claim because having the same panel member hear the merits of the claim creates a reasonable apprehension of bias. The Board held that no evidence of actual or reasonable apprehension of bias was presented and, moreover, that the Board's decision on the order of questioning did not touch on the merits of the Applicants' refugee claim."], ["[12]", "The Applicants subsequently filed for leave to judicially review the Board's decision on the preliminary motion. On February 16, 2005, the Court dismissed the application without prejudice to the Applicants' right to raise arguments of procedural fairness in the context of a judicial review of the Board's Decision on the merits of the Applicants' refugee claim should the Board's final decision be unfavourable to the Applicants.", "DECISION ON THE MERITS"], ["[13]", "In its Decision, the Board determined that the Applicants were neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.

Hence, the Board dismissed their claim for refugee protection under section 96 of the", "Immigration and Refugee Protection Act", ", S.C. 2001, c. 27 (", "Act", "). With respect to refugee protection under section 97 of the", "Act", ", the Board concluded that the existence of adequate state protection was determinative and, moreover, that the Applicants had not established that they would be personally in danger or at risk. The Board acknowledged, however, that there was a generalized risk to persons living in Israel at this difficult time."], ["[14]", "The Board questioned why the Applicants did not move from their neighbourhood until 2004 if they had feared for their lives since 2000. The Board found inadequate the Applicants' explanation that they did not move sooner because they did not have enough money to do so. The Board noted that the principal claimant, Charle Hitti, vacationed with his family every year, had money to buy plane tickets to Canada for the whole family, and had $5,000 to settle in Canada."], ["[15]", "The Board also found it implausible that, after they moved, the Applicants continued to be threatened by the Muslims from their former neighbourhood who had wanted them to leave. Moreover, the Board found that neither the harm the family experienced when they lived with Charle Hitti's mother, namely overcrowding, nor the trauma experienced by Rana Hitti on witnessing the murder of a Muslim woman by her husband, were related to the Applicants' ethnicity or religion."], ["[16]", "In its reasons, the Board noted that there are persons similarly situated to the Applicants who remain in Israel, including Charle Hitti's brother and mother. The Board reviewed the supporting documentary evidence and found that it did not assist the Applicants in establishing a subjective fear of persecution in Israel on the basis of their ethnicity and religion. Regarding the letter by Father Yusuf Essa, of the Maronite Church in Nazareth, the Board noted that Father Essa made no reference to any personal targeting of the family which led to their flight to Canada. Moreover, Father Essa stated that the principal applicant \"decided to immigrate to Canada, in order to provide a better future for his kids.\""], ["[17]", "The Board also found that an article provided by the Applicants after the hearings was not relevant to the Applicants' case. That article spoke of an incident between Druze and Christians in Maghar. The Board noted that the country documentation makes a distinction between Druze and Muslims. Finally, with respect to a news article reporting that a robber stole a gold cross from a Coptic Church in Nazareth, the Board stated that there was no information in the article indicating any anti-Christian motive behind the theft."], ["[18]", "Regarding the existence of an internal flight alternative (IFA), the Board canvassed with the principal applicant the possibility of the family moving to Haifa. The Board noted that Charle Hitti had worked on the outskirts of Haifa for 18 years and had not experienced any problems. Mr. Hitti testified that his children could not obtain a proper Christian education in Haifa. The Board acknowledged that Human Rights Watch found state discrimination in Israel in relation to education and funding for education which disproportionately favours Jews. Nevertheless, the Board held that education for Arabs is available and that a lesser quality of education is not considered a restriction of a fundamental human right."], ["[19]", "Although the Board acknowledged that Arab Christians in Israel experience discrimination, the Board held that, even cumulatively, the ill treatment experienced by Christian Arabs generally, or the Applicants specifically, did not amount to persecution. The Board stated that there is no question that Arabs are not treated equally in terms of land ownership, access to services, and access to employment in higher levels of government. However, the Board also noted that while there is a higher unemployment rate for Arab Israelis, this does not mean Arab Israelis cannot get employment. Moreover, the Board found there is clear documentary evidence that serious efforts are being made by the Israeli government to protect its citizens, both Israeli and Arab."], ["[20]", "The Board also addressed the issue of delay in leaving Israel and the principal applicant's failure to claim refugee protection in the United States when he went there in 2003. The Board held that, while not determinative on their own, the delay in leaving and the failure to claim refugee protection at the earliest opportunity were evidence of behaviour that does not support a genuine fear of persecution."], ["[21]", "Notwithstanding the above findings, the Board went on to address the issue of state protection. The Board found that the Applicants had not provided clear and convincing evidence that there is no adequate state protection for them or other Arabs in Israel. In its reasons, the Board noted that the Applicants had not given the police an opportunity to provide protection and to investigate the alleged incidents of harassment and assault. Specifically, the Board noted that, while the Applicants had asked a municipal social worker for assistance, they had not asked the police for help. Moreover, the Board held that it was reasonable to expect the Applicants to produce some supporting documentation of the social worker's efforts or inability to assist them. Finally, regarding the Applicants' evidence that a neighbour had gone to the police twice in 2001 but had received no help, the Board found that there was nothing in the reports indicating the intervention made by the police or the outcome of their investigation."], ["[22]", "The Board made the point that because Israel is a democratic country, there is a greater requirement on the Applicants to exhaust all reasonable remedies to obtain protection from the state before seeking international protection. The Board noted, among other things, that Israel has an independent judiciary, and that a wide variety of local and international human rights groups operate in Israel to assist Jewish and non-Jewish citizens, including the Association of Civil Rights and sexual assault centres. In summary, the Board held that the Applicants had not met their onus of rebutting the presumption of adequate state protection.", "ISSUES"], ["[23]", "The Applicants raise two general issues:", "1.

I note further that the Applicants have not pointed to any circumstances particular to them which would justify or require a variance in the order of questioning, allowing counsel for the Applicants to question first. For example, the Applicants do not suggest they have any vulnerabilities which specifically hindered their ability to present their evidence during testimony at the hearing. As well, the Applicants do not point to any conduct by either the RPO or the Board member which might raise concerns about bias or inappropriate behaviour. Moreover, the Applicants do not claim that the Board did not inform them of the case to be met, or that the Board decided their refugee claim on the basis of an issue that was not put to the Applicants.

The problem is not so much with the expression of this expectation by the IRB, but rather its combination with a number of factors: the monitoring and expectation of compliance, the evidence of compliance, and especially the mandatory language of Guideline 7. These factors, in my view, all serve to fetter Board members' discretion. As Mr. Aterman acknowledged in testimony given on cross-examination: 'It's a balancing which respects adjudicative independence on the one hand and the public and institutional interests in consistency on the other hand'. In the circumstances of this case, the balancing of these interests, essentially because of the mandatory language used in Guideline 7, results in the interests of consistency outweighing the adjudicative independence of the Board member. The mandatory language of Guideline 7, the limited and narrow description of exceptional circumstances provided for in the guideline and the not so subtly expressed expectation of compliance by the IRB, all combine to limit a Board member's discretion. The fact that there are cases where a Board member has chosen not to follow the guideline does not cure these deficiencies. As stated earlier, the essence of discretion is that it can be exercised differently in different cases on the merits of the case. A guideline should not have the effect of causing a member, in conducting a hearing, to question whether he or she can adopt a particular procedure or a particular order of questioning of a claimant when the Board member legitimately holds the view that the standard order prescribed by the guideline is not the best or fairest way to proceed in the circumstances. There is uncontroverted evidence that for at least certain Board members this is the case. Guideline 7 in my view has the effect of dictating a certain procedure and allowing few exceptions, on a procedural issue that could potentially affect the fairness of the hearing. Put another way, Guideline 7, for the most part, requires a member to exercise her or his discretion in a particular way. In the result, I find that Guideline 7 fetters the discretion of Board members.\""], ["[66]", "Justice Mosley in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was provided with new evidence that took him beyond the position of Justice Blanchard in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , which is outlined in detail in paragraphs 140 to 172:", "\"I think it fair to say that my colleague Justice Blanchard relied less upon the factual history of the matter before him in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and more upon the evidence relating to the form and content of the Guideline and the manner in which it was implemented in reaching his conclusion that Board Members' discretion was fettered by the imposition of the Guideline. Indeed the applicants have submitted, as discussed above, that had he had a record before him similar to certain of those in these proceedings, he may have found that a higher degree of procedural protection was called for.", "\"The respondent points out that there was no evidence on the record in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> of a refusal by the Board Member to exercise his discretion to vary the order of questioning due to the claimant's particular circumstances, no evidence of any particular vulnerability that would make testimony difficult, no argument of improper questioning and no request to vary the order outside the assertion of an absolute right to an examination-in-chief.", "\"The finding in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that members' discretion is fettered turns on the language of the Guideline itself and the extrinsic evidence about how it could be interpreted and applied by RPD members and not on the facts of the particular case.", "\"At paragraph 119 of his reasons, Justice Blanchard found that the language of Guideline 7 left little doubt that the thrust of the Guideline indicates to Board members a mandatory process rather than a recommended but optional process: paragraph 19 provides that the standard practice", "will be", "for the RPO to begin, and if no RPO is participating at the hearing, the Board member", "will", "begin. Further, while paragraph 23 allowed for the Board member to vary the order of questioning, the basis for the finding by the Court in", "Zaki", "that it was sufficiently flexible, Justice Blanchard found that it set a high threshold for what constitutes 'exceptional circumstances': the claimant must be 'severely' disturbed and the child must be 'very' young for an exception to apply.

He went on to state these views on the language used in Guideline 7:", "'The use of qualifiers such as \"severely\" and \"very\" leave little doubt that the scope of \"such circumstances\" contemplated by the guideline is limited. There may well be circumstances which do not fit within the scope of those \"exceptional circumstances\" contemplated in Guideline 7 which, in the discretion of the Board Member, would warrant proceeding otherwise than by the standard order of questioning. The language of paragraph 23 may leave a member with the impression that he or she has no option but to follow the guideline in such cases. At the very least, in my view, paragraph 23 by requiring \"exceptional circumstances\" for straying from the norm deters the member from considering other factors before deciding what order of questioning is appropriate. Guideline 7 would in effect, in such a case, serve to fetter the member's discretion.'", "\"In urging me to depart from these conclusions, the respondent submits that the language of the Guideline has to be read as permissive rather than mandatory in keeping with the principles established in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that discretion given by statute cannot be confined by general policy statements and that a term such as 'will normally' does not mean 'in every case'. Here, the respondent submits, the contextual evidence including the Board's policy on the use of guidelines, indicate that members retain discretion to vary the order of questioning where they deem it appropriate.", "\"The respondent relies on the new evidence attached to the affidavit of Asad Kiyani, some forty decisions and excerpts of transcripts from hearings before various RPD members, which, the respondent submits, demonstrate that the conclusion that members' discretion has been fettered is not shared by the members themselves.

There are no indications in these exhibits that Board members believe that they will be punished for failing to implement the standard order of questioning. Nor do they support the conclusion that the Guideline has the effect of causing a member, in conducting a hearing, to question whether he or she can adopt a particular procedure or a particular order of questioning of a claimant when the Board member legitimately holds the view that the standard order prescribed by the Guideline is not the best or fairest way to proceed in the circumstances.", ". . . . .", "\"These examples indicate to me that members understand that the illustrations of exceptional circumstances provided by the Guideline are simply that and that members feel free to apply them broadly.", "\"In contrast, the strongest evidence put forward by the applicants is an excerpt from the Board's decision in", "Baskaran", "(Board File: TA1-07530), attached to Mr. Boulakia's affidavit, in which the Member stated:", "'We have been told that we have to do the questioning first and your counsel will be asking you questions after that, and that's the procedure we have to follow. ...'", "\"The applicants point to this excerpt as indicating that members would feel under pressure to conform to the practice outlined in the Guideline, out of loyalty to the institution and, in some cases, from a lack of confidence in their own discretion and ability to make independent decisions as to the correct procedure to follow.

In their PIF, the Applicants state that they fear persecution at the hands of Muslims in their neighbourhood in Nazareth; the Applicants do not make a claim of persecution against the government of Israel. However, in reviewing the testimony of the principal applicant, Charle Hitti, and the written arguments presented to the Board by counsel for the Applicant, it would appear that the Applicants are also claiming that the discrimination they face at the hands of the Israeli government constitutes persecution.

In my opinion, this is evidence that it is not likely that their former Muslim neighbours continued to pursue the Applicants after they moved to a different neighbourhood. Moreover, I find that it was not patently unreasonable for the Board to find inadequate the Applicants' explanation as to why they did not leave the predominantly Muslim neighbourhood in which they alleged they had been targeted until 2004, and why they did not approach the police for help. In my view, the Board did not commit a reviewable error in finding the Applicants had not established a well-founded fear of persecution or risk to life at the hands of Arab Muslims from their former neighbourhood."], ["[74]", "Regarding the question of whether the discrimination faced in Israel at large by the Applicants as Arabs and/or Arab Christians in relation to Jews constitutes persecution, I am of the opinion that the Board did not commit a reviewable error in finding that it does not.

However, it was reasonable for the Board to conclude that such evidence does not give rise to a finding of persecution, particularly given the Board's finding that the state protection against persecution is adequate in Israel."], ["[75]", "Finally, with respect to the existence of an IFA and adequate state protection, I do not find that the Board's determinations were patently unreasonable or unreasonable respectively.

The Applicants have not pointed the Court to any reviewable error made by the Board in coming to these conclusions, and in particular in relation to the Board's finding that while the situation facing the Applicants may constitute discrimination it does not amount to persecution.

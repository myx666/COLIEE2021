They were also arrested, beaten and escorted to their house by military men who went through the house looking for proof that they were members of the opposition.

When con­sidering recent changes in circumstances, the Commission ought to have considered the documentary evidence, to conduct an analysis and to refer to same in support of its conclusion.

What is relevant is the perception that the authorities have of per­sons in the applicant's position. In light of her testimony and documentary evidence, the Commission should have concluded that she and her family face prospects of persecution because they are perceived as political op­ponents. Similarly, the Commission erred in finding that the applicant's fear was not well-founded despite her membership in the UPDS in Canada.

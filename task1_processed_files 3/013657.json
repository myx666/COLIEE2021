The evidence in support of Mrs. Mindich's attachment to Canada appears to consist entirely of relatively passive elements. She has maintained an apartment since May 1, 1996. Her previous residence, which she describes as having rented, was at 5 Fisherville #1004, Toronto, Ontario. On her Record of Landing, Mrs. Mindich gave the name of her son as the person willing to assist her in Canada. The son's address is 5 Fisherville Street #1004, Willowdale, Ontario.

It is more consistent with Mrs. Mindich acquiring a \"pied-à-terre\" in Canada to facilitate visiting her son while maintaining her former life in Israel. I find in the record little evidence capable of supporting a conclusion that Mrs. Mindich has centralized her mode of life in Canada for three years preceding her application for citizenship.

The Affidavit of Service of the Notice of Application does not establish that Mrs. Mindich was personally served with the Notice of Application. However, she subsequently filed a Notice of Appearance indicating her intention to oppose the application. Pursuant to rule 147, I am prepared to validate service on the ground that the filing of the Notice of Appearance is evidence that the Notice of Application came to Mrs. Mindich's attention. Mrs. Mindich was advised of the date of the hearing by the Registry by ordinary mail. Counsel for the Minister advised the court that her office had received a call from someone on behalf of Mrs. Mindich indicating that she was concerned about the appeal and did not know what to do. She was apparently advised to contact the Federal Court for more information. There is no indication in the file of any contact being made with the court."], ["[17]", "There may be circumstances in which the court would not allow an applicant his/her remedy when entitlement had been established because the respondent, though having notice of the proceedings, did not attend. This is not one of those cases, primarily because Mrs. Mindich is free to bring another application for citizenship at any time.

I find, therefore, that the Board's consideration of the evidence was reasonable."], ["[67]", "First, I do not share the appellant's opinion that the Board dissected and reviewed the Mark out of context."], ["[68]", "I agree that the Mark is an expression invented by Mr. Demoy and that the appellant considers it to be whimsical. Moreover, the appellant submits that the expression comprising the Mark is not part of ordinary language. However, although it is invented and whimsical, the Mark is made up of a word \"crémant\" and an expression \"de glace\" that are part of ordinary language, are defined in the dictionaries and, in the context of the wares, have a well-known ordinary meaning."], ["[69]", "It was not unreasonable for the Board to use dictionary definitions to determine the meaning of the words comprising the Mark and then determine the ordinary meaning of the expression created by these two words, in the context of the wares."], ["[70]", "Case law has recognized the usefulness of referring to dictionary definitions to determine the meaning of the words comprising a mark (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) at para 2, 91 NR 148), even when the expression contains more than one word (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at pp 944, 946, 16 DLR (3d) 740)."], ["[71]", "Moreover, expert evidence in support of the definitions is not always helpful and, in this case, I find that such evidence was not necessary. The following passage from", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 1723, applies here:", "23 Both sides produced affidavits from linguists, who were cross-examined. Their evidence relates to both the clearly descriptive and confusion aspects of the case. In my opinion, they add little to the debate and would not have persuaded the Registrar to change her mind. In this case, where the objective is to assess the meaning of the words \"marché express\" in the French language as perceived on first impression by the reasonable everyday user of the services, expert evidence which mainly consists of a discussion of rules of grammar, semantics and linguistic constructions regarding the interpretation of these words is unnecessary and not particularly helpful."], ["[72]", "In this case, other than one isolated definition, all the definitions of the word \"crémant\" filed as evidence by the respondent refer to a type of wine, a slightly sparkling wine. None of the definitions of the word \"crémant\" in evidence refer to a more general meaning that could refer to an alcoholic beverage that could be made with other fruit."], ["[73]", "Furthermore, as seen in the evidence, the expression \"de glace\", associated with cider or wine, designates a cider or sweet wine made from fruit or fruit juice that has been naturally frozen."], ["[74]", "In light of the definitions in evidence, I find that it was reasonable for the Board to accept the ordinary meaning of the words comprising the Mark, specifically a slightly sparkling wine made from frozen fruit. The word \"crémant\" and the expression \"de glace\" each have an ordinary meaning, and the expression \"crémant de glace\", viewed in its entirety, also has an ordinary meaning. It is clear from the decision that the Board did not dissect the Mark and that it assessed the word \"crémant\" when followed by the expression \"de glace\" in the context of the wares, ice ciders. Thus, the Board came to a reasonable conclusion that is based on the evidence when it stated \"the average consumer is more likely than not to think that the word \"crémant\" followed by the accepted term \"de glace\" would infer its everyday meaning\". Accordingly, it was reasonable to find that the Mark describes something that it is not."], ["[75]", "This conclusion is not less reasonable because the word \"crémant\" can have a second meaning. The definition relied upon by the appellant and that refers to the action of creaming is an isolated definition that, moreover, seems quite distant from the context of the wares. Thus, it was reasonable and not speculative to find that the word \"crémant\", in its ordinary meaning, refers to a type of wine. Given all of the evidence, I believe that the Board was not obliged to accept an isolated definition. In", "Ron Matusalem", ", as in this case, one of the words comprising the mark had two possible meanings and the Court ruled that the Board's decision, in which it chose to give the expression at issue a meaning based on one of the definitions in evidence, was reasonable."], ["[76]", "I also believe that it was not unreasonable for the Board, based on the evidence and common sense, to take judicial notice of the fact that \"ciders and wines are alcoholic drinks generally sold and promoted by way of the same distribution channels\" (para 22 of the decision). Moreover, Mr. Demoy confirmed that the ciders bearing the Mark are sold through the Société des alcools du Québec (SAQ). Furthermore, the evidence included samples of SAQ advertising showing two bottles of cider and three bottles of wine on the same page. Therefore, it seems reasonable to me, in light of all the evidence, that the Board found that it deemed \"it more probable than not that the Mark would lead people to wrongly believe that the wares consist in a slightly sparkling wine, fermented from naturally frozen fruit, whereas these are in fact \"apple ciders\". Thus I find that the Board's conclusion regarding the deceptive character of the Mark falls within a range of reasonable conclusions it could have drawn from the evidence."], ["[77]", "I also find that the Board did not err by refusing to examine the Mark as it appears on the labels submitted by the appellant. The appellant submits that the labels clearly indicate that the product associated with the Mark is cider. I agree with that, but the Mark must be considered independently and not in the way its owner decides to market and promote it. The fact that there are regulations governing the marketing of apple cider does not change the fact that a trade-mark must be reviewed independently."], ["[78]", "Last, I find that it was reasonable for the Board to reject the appellant's argument based on its family of marks. Before the Board, the appellant's argument was based solely on the fact that it owned two other registered marks, without any evidence of the use of these marks. Merely proving the existence of the appellant's two other registered marks was clearly insufficient to prove the use of a family of marks. Moreover, as I have already stated, in my opinion, even the additional evidence submitted by the appellant in this appeal is also insufficient to establish a family of marks, even less a family used to such an extent that it would contradict the first impression of the average consumer of the wares at issue."], ["[79]", "The situation here differs from the context in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (QL), 186 FTR 93. In that case, the Court dismissed an appeal from a decision of the Registrar who had held that the mark \"Goût de Beurre Comme au Cinéma\", in relation to popcorn or popping corn, was not clearly descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive. In the Registrar's view, consumers were accustomed to seeing the word \"butter\" with food products that contained no butter. This conclusion relied on evidence of other trade-marks that have the word \"butter\" for products that do not contain butter, advertising campaigns that used slogans such as \"I can't believe it's not butter\" and \"Souvenirs de beurre\", and the existence of other products with \"butter\" on the label when the product did not contain any butter. In my opinion, the evidence of \"consumer habits\" in that case was much more substantial than in this case."], ["[80]", "The appellant also raised the importance of the trade-marks register being consistent and contended that since its two other marks containing the word \"crémant\" in relation to cider had been registered, the Mark should also be registered. It relied on", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) at para 9, 62 FTR 92). I find that this argument cannot succeed."], ["[81]", "First, the appellant's two other marks are comprised of expressions that differ from the Mark because they explicitly associate the word \"crémant\" with the word \"pomme\". Therefore, I can believe that in such a context, the first impression of the consumer, who would usually associate the word \"crémant\" with sparkling wine, could be modified by the addition of the word \"pomme\" so that the consumer would understand that the product was made with apples and not grapes. The Mark has nothing that would likely counter the ordinary meaning of the word \"crémant\". In my opinion, there is a significant distinction to be made between the meaning inferred by the Mark and the meaning inferred by the appellant's two other marks."], ["[82]", "Second, I share the opinion of my colleague Justice Martineau, who, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 240, stated that \"if the Registrar erred in the past, there is no reason to perpetuate that error\"."], ["[83]", "Thus, I find that the Board could reasonably determine that the expression \"CRÉMANT DE GLACE\" is deceptively misdescriptive in relation to the relevant wares, alcoholic drinks, excluding wines and beers, specifically apple ciders. Its decision is intelligible and articulate. It is supported by the evidence in the record and falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."], ["[84]", "For all these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[85]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that the appeal is dismissed with costs in favour of the respondent.", "Appeal dismissed.", "Editor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/vnh"]]}

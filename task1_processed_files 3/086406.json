Indeed, since the computer system utilized by visa officers only recognizes a pass mark of 70 units of assessment (that required for independent applicants), all members of the assisted relative category under paragraph 10(1)b) are awarded an administrative five (5) bonus units of assessment. This bonus serves to make up the difference between the 65 units required by Assisted Relative category members and the 70 units recognized as a pass mark by the computer system.", "\"24.

However, the Finance Officer had been unable to fairly make a determination in this regard due to the poor quality of the Band's financial records. The Appeal Tribunal recommended that the Finance Officer keep better records of the money owed to the Board to avoid similar problems in the future.", "• With respect to the applicant's allegation that his agents had been excluded from attending at the advanced polling station in Saskatoon, the Appeal Tribunal indicated that the Saskatoon polling station was too small to accommodate voters, election officials, and agents. It pointed out that agents were present when the ballot boxes were locked prior to ballots being cast and at the end of the day when the boxes were sealed. When the polling station was too busy to accommodate them in the room itself, agents were invited to observe from the hallway. The Appeal Tribunal recommended that the Election Act be revised to require polling locations to be large enough to accommodate agents.", "• On the issue of whether or not competent, impartial and even-handed \"enablers\" had been appointed, the Appeal Tribunal found that the Elder who had been appointed to assist voters in this regard understood the responsibility associated with the task and was competent, impartial, even-handed and respectful of each voter's right to have their ballot properly marked. The Appeal Tribunal recommended that, in the future, where a voter requires physical assistance marking their ballot, that a tribunal member, family member or the CEO should observe the proper marking of the ballot.", "• Finally, with respect to the applicant's allegation regarding the continued use of Band resources after nomination day, the Appeal Tribunal found that nomination day was the last day that the incumbent councillors conducted business or made use of Band resources."], ["[10]", "The Appeal Tribunal also addressed the applicant's allegation that the CEO and the DEO failed to protect the integrity of the election process, the ballots and the ballot boxes.

The respondent also asserts that the Election Act codified the Band customary law and reflects the Band's intention to preserve its culture and language. Its purpose is to ensure that governance of the Band remains in harmony with their spirit and tradition. The respondent further argues that the Election Act was adopted as an exercise of the Band's inherent right as a First Nation and that, accordingly, the Appeal Tribunal derives its power from custom as opposed to an Act of Parliament.

Standard of review"], ["[19]", "The first question relates to the interpretation of the Election Act by the Appeal Tribunal and, more specifically, to the interpretation of section 12.3 of the Election Act.

I disagree."], ["[22]", "A standard of review analysis in this case leads me to conclude that the Appeal Tribunal's decision must be reviewed under the correctness standard despite section 12.10 of the Election Act. First, I am of the view that this issue raises a question of law: Does section 12.3 of the Election Act allow the Appeal Tribunal, when assessing an appeal at the first stage, to rely on extrinsic evidence and/or personal knowledge? This issue involves the interpretation of procedural provisions from the Election Act and not a factual finding. Second, the evidence does not establish that the Appeal Tribunal members have any expertise in the interpretation of procedural formalities from the Election Act. Although one member of the Appeal Tribunal previously sat on an Appeal Tribunal, the tribunal is composed of members appointed for a time-limited mandate. They have no special expertise and it is noteworthy that counsel for the respondent was present during the deliberation of the Appeal Tribunal to assist the members. For these reasons, I conclude that the Appeal Tribunal's decision must be held up to the correctness standard.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 182, Justice Noël also held that the issue \"of the proper exercise of jurisdiction by the Appeal Board\" attracted a correctness review.\""], ["[23]", "This conclusion is reinforced by the intertwined question of procedural fairness at issue.

These considerations were not mentioned in the Appeal Tribunal's decision and were only advanced in the respondent's Memorandum and oral arguments at the hearing. These elements may well have been factors that the Appeal Tribunal considered, but they were not accounted for in the decision. In the context of Judicial Review, a tribunal's decision cannot be complemented by considerations offered ex post facto. Accordingly, since the Court does not know if the Appeal Tribunal considered those elements, the respondent's argument regarding the impact of the issues on the election result will be disregarded."], ["[33]", "With respect to the applicant's allegation that the Appeal Tribunal failed to observe the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, the respondent contends that the appellant had an opportunity to seek legal advice before filing his Notice of Appeal and discuss the sufficiency of any supporting documents with a lawyer (para 73 of the respondent's Memorandum)."], ["[34]", "Although counsel for the respondent insisted on several occasions on the good faith of the Appeal Tribunal members, this element is not at issue. The applicant did not argue that the Appeal Tribunal members acted in bad faith and the evidence does not show any bad faith on the part of any of the electoral officers or the Appeal Tribunal members. The issue is whether the Appeal Tribunal followed the procedure provided in the Election Act. With respect, I am of the view that it did not."], ["[35]", "The Appeal process is a two-stage process. During the first stage, the Appeal Tribunal's mandate is limited to determining whether the appeal is supported by sufficient evidence to warrant a full hearing.

I do not suggest that the Tribunal members should have been forbidden from attending the election and the count. But having done so, it was unfair for them to then rely on their own personal knowledge when determining that Mr. Lavallee's appeals had no merit, without first giving him fair notice of the factual evidence that contradicted his allegations. He should have been allowed to respond to that contradictory evidence before the Tribunal decided whether any or all of his three ppeals [sic] warranted a hearing.", "64.

Both the matter of locating the advance poll in Saskatoon and the matter of Elder Margaret Ermine's assistance were at issue in the appeal.

There is no indication in the Election Act that the decision of the Appeal Tribunal must be unanimous. However, as noted by Justice Tremblay-Lamer in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paragraph 21, an objection by a member of the tribunal is \"a strong indication that there is enough evidence to go to a formal hearing and that a summary dismissal is inappropriate in the circumstance.\""], ["[53]", "While I do not consider that the Appeal Tribunal was improperly constituted, I do find that the refusal by one of the three members of the Appeal Tribunal to endorse the Preliminary Ruling dismissing the applicant's appeal is a strong indication that there was sufficient evidence to warrant a formal hearing under sections 12.5 to 12.8 of the Election Act."], ["[54]", "For the foregoing reasons, this application for judicial review is allowed.", "VII.

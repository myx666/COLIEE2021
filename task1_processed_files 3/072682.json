According to the applicant, the RAD erred in assuming a role comparable to that of a superior court of justice rather than to that of a specialized appeal tribunal. The applicant submits that the RAD must conduct an independent analysis of the case and may recognize, where appropriate, the RPD's credibility findings.

It is, rather, a question of interpreting its home statute and its mandate, not a question of jurisdiction.

Such an interpretation would run counter to Parliament's intention to create an effective right of appeal from decisions that would otherwise be brought before this Court.

For example, even if a country is not part of those that are excluded from an appeal, when the RPD refers in its decision to no credible basis for the refugee claim (subsection 107(2) of the IRPA), there cannot be an appeal before the RAD (paragraph 110(2)(c) of the IRPA). Further, the RAD may enter new evidence in an appeal and decide to hold an oral hearing in cases specified by Parliament (subsections 110(3) to (6) of the IRPA).

By reviewing individual RPD decisions on the merits, the RAD can efficiently remedy errors made by the RPD. That, if you will, is the safety net for the RPD.

As I said to this committee before, we don't see that as a benefit simply in that it will improve the quality of our decision-making.

La SPR a également conclu que les Roms qui étaient victimes de discrimination pouvaient s'adresser au commissaire parlementaire aux droits des minorités nationales et ethniques (le commissaire aux minorités). Le commissaire aux minorités pouvait prendre des mesures s'il était informé de pratiques injustes ou de cas de discrimination.

Lorsque la SPR lui a demandé si elle s'attendait à ce que la police le fasse à sa place, elle a répondu qu'elle s'attendait à ce que les policiers lui demandent le nom du professeur, qu'ils la croient et qu'ils tiennent le professeur en question responsable.

Selon l'exposé circonstancié de Jolan, la police a mentionné qu'elle ouvrirait une enquête contre les auteurs inconnus de l'agression.

À la question de savoir ce qu'elle avait dit à la police à propos de l'agression physique dont elle a été victime, Jolan a répondu qu'elle a dit à la police qu'elle avait été agressée par quatre ou cinq personnes et qu'il s'agissait très probablement des personnes qui lui avaient envoyé des lettres de menaces. Tenue d'indiquer si la police avait mené une enquête sur ses allégations, Jolan a répondu qu'elle l'ignorait.

La preuve documentaire ci-dessous indique que, si Jolan ou l'un des demandeurs d'asile n'étaient pas satisfaits de l'intervention de la police à la suite de leurs allégations, ils auraient disposé de recours.

Il y a eu une hausse particulièrement forte des agressions graves et parfois mortelles depuis 2008, ce qui a attisé les tensions sociales et a amoindri le sentiment de protection physique des minorités partout au pays. Le rapport indique également que l'intervention du gouvernement relativement à ce grave problème a été ambivalente. Les autorités hongroises ont démontré qu'elles étaient résolues à intervenir dans les cas particuliers très médiatisés de crimes haineux, même si leur intervention générale est toujours ternie par des failles importantes. Les hauts représentants du gouvernement ont dénoncé publiquement certains des cas récents les plus graves de violence contre les Roms, bien que dans la plupart des cas, seulement après que la violence a augmenté considérablement. Des progrès ont été faits dans les enquêtes relatives à un certain nombre d'agressions violentes graves qui ont eu lieu en 2008 et en 2009. Le gouvernement hongrois de l'époque a affecté des ressources considérables d'application de la loi aux enquêtes et a sollicité la coopération internationale dans ces efforts. Les autorités ont également pris certaines mesures pour rendre les agents d'application de la loi responsables des comportements répréhensibles au cours des enquêtes sur les crimes haineux."], ["[36] Bien que de nombreux rapports et articles contenus dans la preuve documentaire présentée par le conseil décrivent les problèmes qu'éprouvent les Roms en Hongrie, il est souvent fait mention de comptes rendus des efforts et des réussites de la Hongrie pour ce qui est d'offrir une meilleure protection aux Roms dans ces mêmes rapports et articles.

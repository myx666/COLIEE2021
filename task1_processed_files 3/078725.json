(3d) 264 (F.C.T.D.), per Justice Evans (as he then was) at paragraph 15. The RPD in this case ignored the medical report and focused unduly on the failure of the psychiatric report to discuss the applicant's allegations. In my view it was not reasonably open to the RPD to make an adverse credibility finding with respect to the psychiatric report without reading it in conjunction with the medical report. The medical report is a significant piece of evidence which was not mentioned in the RPD's reasons. However, at the hearing the RPD does consider the report and comment that it does corroborate the applicant's story. However, it is obvious that these small scars could be consistent with injuries other than torture.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "As I mentioned in these reasons, when a credibility finding is based on a number of points, the reviewing Court's analysis does not involve determining whether each point in the RPD's reasoning meets the reasonableness test:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 22.

Unlike the applicant in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , this applicant's allegation of a well founded fear of persecution was dismissed because his conduct in Trinidad was not that of a person who feared persecution and who was looking to claim refugee status. The RPD's reasonable credibility findings undercut the applicant's allegations risk. While the Board accepted that the applicant was an Alevi Kurd who was discriminated against, it found that there was no evidence that this discrimination amounted to persecution or that he was targeted by the authorities or the PKK.

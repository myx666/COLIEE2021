The charges were stayed in November 2012 and it appears from the record that a factual basis for those charges was not substantiated. However, in a decision rendered on December 30, 2012, the Parole Board of Canada imposed additional conditions on the applicant, including residence in a half-way house, having concluded that the applicant's behaviour demonstrated \"the enduring nature of [his] criminal attitudes\". This decision was made in the absence of the applicant and his counsel due to factors that appear to have been beyond their control. An attempt to appeal the decision did not proceed due to the brief period remaining in the applicant's sentence before warrant expiry. Nor was there any attempt to seek judicial review of the Parole Board decision."], ["[5]", "When the criminal warrant expired on January 11, 2013, the applicant was placed in immigration detention.

An order issued on August 8, 2013 was also the subject of an application for leave and for judicial review. Leave was granted. The matter was settled by a judgment on consent on the basis that \"the Immigration Division erred in stating that it had no jurisdiction to revisit the National, Parole Board Decision\"."], ["[7]", "This application for judicial review concerns the detention review decision made on December 19, 2013. Since then, there have been several other review hearings and orders for continued detention. This matter is, therefore, moot as the decision being reviewed is spent. However, the parties are agreed that the Court should exercise its discretion to decide the application as the applicant is unlikely to be deported in the near future and the issues raised in the present application will continue to be live issues in his ongoing detention reviews.

The Member had previously determined that Ms. Protacio would be unsuitable as a bondsperson because she had been found to have engaged in misrepresentation on the applicant's behalf. The Member also found Mrs. Trudy Woollett, who had come forward with her husband, Mr. Glen Woollett, to be unsuitable on the basis that she did not have a close relationship with the applicant; that the nature of their relationship is \"sporadic\"; that she \"has no idea what kind of person he is\"; that she contradicted herself a number of times and acknowledged that a lot of information about the applicant had been given to her recently; that she was not familiar with the facts of the serious crime which had led to the applicant's incarceration; that the couple was not in a position to supervise the applicant effectively; and that the applicant had only recently approached the couple for help.", "III.", "ISSUES:"], ["[12]", "The applicant raises the following issues:", "1.

If taken literally, this would include the Member's finding on August 8, 2013 that she could not look behind the Parole Board decision. That decision was relevant to whether or to what extent the applicant had breached the terms of his statutory release, which had been incorporated into the terms of his immigration release in April 2012. The alleged breach of these terms had been grounds for detaining and continuing the applicant's detention. The issue was raised before Justice Gleason but not settled in her June 14, 2013 decision. However, at paragraph 30 of her reasons she had commented on the necessary inquiry as involving consideration of the competing interests of the finality of tribunal decisions and fairness to the applicant."], ["[22]", "It was open to the Board to conclude that the applicant had had a full opportunity to contest the grounds for the Parole Board's factual findings and that it should not revisit the issue. This would apply particularly where the other tribunal's decision had not been appealed and/or judicial review was not sought. It would be a rare occasion when the Board would be justified in questioning the outcome of a proceeding before another administrative tribunal acting within its own jurisdiction. However, in this instance the Parole Board decision had been made in the absence of both the applicant and his counsel for justified reasons. Moreover, extensive evidence and argument was led by the applicant in the August 2013 detention review proceedings to demonstrate that the Parole Board's findings were based, at least in part, on unfounded criminal charges that were withdrawn by the Crown. The Parole Board's decision was also made in part, I note, because the Parole Board also appeared to be concerned about the applicant's continued association with criminal elements."], ["[23]", "The ID Member had previously refused to consider the evidence and argument led by the applicant to challenge the Parole Board findings in the August 2013 proceedings on the ground that reconsideration of those findings was not within her jurisdiction.

Moreover, they had a clear plan to monitor the applicant. In rejecting them as bondspersons, the Member had resiled from the position she had taken in November 2013 that the applicant could be released with a suitable bondsperson."], ["[31]", "The respondent points out that there have been numerous detention review decisions since April 2012 that have resulted in the applicant's detention being continued. At the April 2012 hearing the ID was not aware of a March 2011 incident which resulted in the applicant being convicted of offences arising from an altercation with the police. At the time of his arrest, he was found in possession of a fraudulent passport from an African state. In January 2013, the applicant was found criminally inadmissible to Canada, lost his permanent resident status, and was issued a deportation order. In March 2013, the bonds posted in April 2012 were forfeited.

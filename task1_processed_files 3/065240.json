He joined a group called Liberation Light that helped those with drug or alcohol abuse issues overcome their problems. He joined the group in November of 2000 to help him \"overcome\" his homosexuality. He attended the group for two years.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "After some time away from the group, the Principal Applicant returned in 2006. Upon his return, he became concerned that the group was promoting hatred and discrimination against homosexuals. He discussed this approach with the group's coordinator, but the coordinator was not interested in change. The Principal Applicant then made public statements at a group meeting opposing the group's approach to dealing with homosexuals. His statements provoked much controversy within the group. The group soon lost many of its clients and was forced to cease operating.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "The leaders of the group then threatened serious harm against the Principal Applicant. He reported this threat to the police. The sons of one of the group leaders then assaulted him and his brother. The Principal Applicant did not report this assault to the police because his assailants had warned him not to because of their father's contacts with authorities in Mexico. Moreover, he felt that Mexican police discriminate against homosexuals and, as a result, assistance would not be forthcoming.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "These incidents resulted in the Principal Applicant and his brother fleeing from Mexico. After they left Mexico, their parents were targeted and windows in their home were smashed on three occasions. The parents then fled Mexico and joined their sons in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "The Principal Applicant, his brother, and his mother and father filed a joint application for refugee status in Canada.

The Board paid particular attention to the documentary evidence pertaining to discrimination, harassment and criminal acts against homosexuals in Mexico, as well the evidence about the police, mechanisms for lodging complaints, and the level of democracy in Mexico.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The Board noted that the Applicants expressed fear of the group leaders of the Liberation Light as well as fear of the general public that is homophobic and discriminates against and harasses sexual minorities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "The Board noted the Principal Applicant's testimony that his classmates had discriminated against him in school because they perceived him to be homosexual. He did not report this treatment to the principal or teachers because he had not revealed his sexual orientation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "With regard to the state's protection of homosexuals, the Board did not believe that \"the majority of police at all levels do not assist homosexuals since there is no documentary evidence before the panel that states so. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "The Board found that the Principal Applicant had not tried to avail himself of state protection. It noted that \"he did not seek redress regarding the threats he received from [the group leaders] ... and after his brother and he were assaulted by David's sons. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "The Board noted that the Principal Applicant claimed to have knowledge of the existence of federal law concerned with the prevention and elimination of discrimination, but had nonetheless made no effort to seek \"legal assistance or assistance from the state authorities other than police\" when his rights were violated. The Board recognized his belief that the police were corrupt because they were friends with the group leader, but noted that he had not sought help from any \"anti-corruption state agency. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "The Board then considered that the Principal Applicant had knowledge of the Human Rights Commission in Mexico, but he did not seek the Commission's help because its website did not state that it helps homosexuals. The Board noted that he had not provided a copy of the Human Rights Commission's website, so the Board was not persuaded that the \"Human Rights Commissions do not assist homosexuals as alleged. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "The Principal Applicant also had knowledge with regard to a number of organizations in Mexico that address and combat discrimination against homosexuals. However, he did not seek assistance from these bodies because he believed they were corrupt.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "The Board noted that the Principal Applicant did not know of the existence of the Secretariat of Public Administration, or SACTEL, which is a 24-hour hotline that takes complaints from citizens with regard to corruption and misconduct. Although he was aware of the existence of an organization called 06, which functions in a similar way to SACTEL, he chose not to seek their assistance because the group leaders have \"friends everywhere. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "The Principal Applicant also admitted that he had knowledge of the Federal Agency of Investigations which deals with such issues as corrupt state officials, but he stated that he had chosen not to contact them for fear of retribution from the group leaders if he did.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "Similarly, after the Principal Applicant's flight from Mexico, his parents did not seek assistance from any state agency, including the police when their windows were broken. The Board was not convinced that the Principal Applicant's father would not have received assistance from the police if requested, since he is not a homosexual.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "The Board determined that, based on the evidence adduced, it was not convinced that the Principal Applicant would not have received assistance from state agencies had he requested their help. Because Mexico is a democracy, the Board found that \"ignorance of the complaints mechanisms is no excuse for the claimant's failure to pursue the avenues available to her [sic] in Mexico, and taking extreme measures of seeking protection abroad. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "The Board canvassed the agencies available in Mexico, including the federal and state police, and other state agencies that address such issues as drug trafficking, kidnapping, corruption and violence against sexual minorities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "The Board determined that, because they lived in a democracy, the Applicants were required to seek protection from the state agencies in Mexico prior to seeking international protection. In this instance, the Principal Applicant had not sought help from authorities when his rights were violated. Accordingly, the Board found that the Principal Applicant \"did not reasonably exhaust any course of action open to her [sic] in obtaining state protection in Mexico, and hence, he has not discharged the onus of showing clear and convincing proof of the state's inability or unwillingness to protect him. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "While the Board considered the psychologist's report, it determined that there was no persuasive evidence adduced at the hearing to show that psychological help would not be available to the Principal Applicant upon his return to Mexico.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "The Board stated that, while it did not disbelieve the Applicants' evidence of discrimination faced by homosexuals in Mexico, it was not convinced that \"the claimant would not receive adequate state protection against those he fears including the general public should he return to Mexico. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "The Board also considered documentary evidence that the Mexican government was involved with federal police reform, and that public officials, including the police, are punished for misconduct where necessary. Accordingly, the Board determined that there was no lack of police protection for the Applicants. Moreover, the Board was not persuaded that the Principal Applicant would not have received help if he had requested it, based on the training the police receive prior to entering the force coupled with disciplinary measures taken for any misconduct. Rather, the Board found that the Applicants had simply not made any effort to seek assistance from any state agencies in Mexico.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "The Board did not find that the documentary evidence suggested that a majority of the population of Mexico discriminates against homosexuals.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "The Board also considered the existence of SIEDO, the Special Investigations into Organised Crime, and found that there was no proof that SIEDO would not have provided witness protection against the group leaders and the Principal Applicant's assailants had he sought help.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "Moreover, in order to address the misconduct of state agencies that were in collusion with the group leaders, the Board determined that the Principal Applicant should have sought help from anti-corruption agencies. The Board noted that efforts were made in 2007 to target corruption within the federal government, and that the Mexican government has enacted strict laws to deal with corruption and bribery. Consequently, the national corruption index has since decreased in Mexico.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "The Board found there to be no shortage of action from the state authorities against corrupt government officials, including the police.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "The Board also noted that sexual minorities have seen \"substantial political and legal gains at the federal level and in several states and municipalities ... such as Mexico City. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "In 1998, the Mexican Chamber of Deputies voted to repeal discriminatory language in the Federal District Penal Code. Moreover, in 2003, the Mexican congress approved the Federal Law to Prevent and Eliminate Discrimination. The Board also noted the political participation of homosexuals in Mexico is widely accepted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "The Board canvassed the growing homosexual movements in several cities in Mexico and concluded that it was \"not persuaded to believe that the claimant lacks adequate state protection against homophobic Mexicans and employers in Mexico City where a large population of gays reside, and work. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[32]", "Although the Principal Applicant and his family resided in Mexico City where numerous state protection agencies existed, the Board found that they had made no effort to seek help from any of these agencies prior to seeking protection in Canada.

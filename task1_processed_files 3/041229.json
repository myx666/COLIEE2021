Indeed, he has audited translations on behalf of the IRB."], ["[7]", "Mr. Sandhu reviewed the recording of the proceedings and sets out what he considers to be a number of errors. The member of the IAD, who decided not to reopen the appeal, was not the member who heard the appeal in the first place.

However, the errors must be material."], ["[8]", "The member noted that the Minister had not taken issue with the alternative language suggested by Mr. Sandhu. He said: \"I accept that this auditor, given the luxury of time to consider carefully the precise wording that is appropriate, in his professional opinion, has chosen different language where those concerns are expressed in his affidavit.\""], ["[9]", "He concluded, however, based on particular passages cited, that distinctions between the two versions were trivial, or would not lead to a misunderstanding."], ["[10]", "The member concluded that Mr. Sohal had not shown that the interpretation was not continuous, precise, competent, impartial and contemporaneous, or that he was unable to tell his story due to misinterpretations.

He said at paragraph 21 of his decision:", "Regardless of whether or not he spoke Punjabi and could monitor the quality of the interpretation at the hearing, he ought to have known that the applicant's answers to questions were incorrect, incomplete or indicated confusion on the applicant's part.

Consequently, the standard of review pertaining to the quality of interpretation, rather than to the right to interpretation, shall be left to another day.", "ISSUES"], ["[14]", "In my view, this case raises three issues. The first is whether there was a breach of natural justice. This is dependent on the quality of the interpretation between English and Punjabi.

The third issue is more technical. It relates to the lack of affidavit evidence."], ["[15]", "Both parties agree that concerns about the quality of interpretation should be raised at the earliest opportunity. Nuances have been raised, depending on the applicant's knowledge of the language of the Tribunal, be it English or French, and his lawyer's knowledge of the applicant's language, in this case Punjabi. However, there is no need to deal with this issue as, in my opinion, there was nothing to complain about."], ["[16]", "Likewise, in the light of my decision, it is not necessary to consider whether Messrs Sohal and Sandhu should have provided affidavits in this Court.

Mr. Mohammadian was an Iranian Kurd. The first hearing of his refugee claim had to be adjourned because the interpreter and Mr. Mohammadian could not communicate with each other. Apparently, there are four variants of the Kurdish language, depending on one's country of residence, Turkey, Iran, Iraq or Syria. When the hearing first resumed, the interpreter was an Iranian Kurd. There were no difficulties. At the third hearing there was another interpreter. There appeared to be some minor difficulties during the course of the hearing, but no objection was taken at the time.

She recounts that, on December 13, 2009, the Public Security Bureau (PSB) carried out a raid on the home where her church community was meeting.

First, the Board noted that there had been no record in any of the documentary evidence that two members of a house church in Guangdong province had been arrested. The absence of such corroboration to the Applicant's testimony led the Board to draw a negative inference.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "Second, the Board drew a negative inference from the Applicant's failure to mention in her Personal Information Form (PIF) that the PSB had appeared at her mother's house looking for her. It came up only at the hearing and, when asked why she had omitted this significant event from her PIF, the Applicant explained that she did not want to cause her mother trouble by disclosing the information. The Board noted that the Applicant had been represented by counsel at the time she filled out her PIF, and that there was no further explanation for why the Applicant felt comfortable disclosing the information at the hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "Third, the Board drew a negative inference from the lack of a summons issued by the PSB, which failed to corroborate the Applicant's story. The Board relied on the documentary evidence to presume that, given the seriousness of the allegations and the \"relentless pursuit of the PSB,\" a summons would reasonably have been issued for the Applicant's arrest.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "Finally, the Board found the circumstances surrounding the Applicant's travel to Canada implausible and not credible. The Applicant did not know whether her own name was on the passport she used to travel, nor did she know the name of her smuggler. The two did not pretend to be friends, though he held her passport in his possession throughout the trip. The Board found the Applicant's explanation that she was merely following instructions insufficient to overcome the implausibility that she would not know basic details related to her identity and travel arrangements that were likely to be the subject of questioning.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "Given these adverse inferences, the Board determined \"that the claimant's allegation that there was a raid on her house church and that several of her fellow church members were arrested and incarcerated is neither plausible nor credible. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(ii)", "The Applicant's Christian Identity  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "The Board found that the Applicant was not a Christian in China, as she alleged, on the basis of the evidence before it, including the answers the Applicant gave when questioned about her faith. The Board gave little weight both to letters submitted by the pastors of the two churches the Applicant attended after her arrival in Canada and to the Applicant's ability to answer questions about Christianity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "Specifically, the Board was satisfied neither by the Applicant's description of the miracle of Jesus turning water into wine, nor by her statement that the Holy Spirit was not God. The Board found the Applicant's knowledge inconsistent with her alleged devotion to reading the Bible for ten hours every week. While the Board acknowledged that the Applicant demonstrated some Christian knowledge, and that she participated in church activities, this participation did not speak to her motivation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "The Board further concluded that the Applicant's claim had not been made in good faith, and that she joined a Christian church in Canada only for the purpose of supporting a fraudulent refugee claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(iii)", "The Documentary Evidence  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "The Board concluded, based on the documentary evidence, that the situation in Guangdong province does not reflect the situation in many other provinces where there have been arrests and persecution of ordinary Christians. The Board found it suspect that the arrest of two lay church members in the province went unreported, particularly since other incidents - even some less persecutory than arrests - that took place in more remote areas were documented.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "Additionally, the Board indicated that, even if the evidence speaks of some harm that would \"qualify as serious,\" it must consider whether there is a \"serious possibility that the harm will actually come to pass.\" The Board determined in this case that \"the Applicant would have been able to practice her religion in a church of her choice if she were return to her home in Guangdong Province in China and that there is not a serious possibility that she would be persecuted for doing so. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "III.", "Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "The issues raised by this application can be framed in the following manner:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "a) Whether there was an apprehension of bias as a result of procedural irregularities;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "b) Whether the Board erred in its analysis of the Applicant's Christian identity;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "c) Whether the Board erred in its assessment of the Applicant's credibility;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "d) Whether the Board erred in imposing a good faith obligation on the Applicant; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "e) Whether the Board erred in its assessment of the risk faced by practising Christians in Guangdong province.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "IV.", "Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "Questions of procedural fairness, including apprehension of bias, are reviewable on the standard of correctness (", "Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 43).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "This Court has held that the assessment of an applicant's religious knowledge is a question of fact (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 1083 at para 8;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 677 at para 4). The second issue is thus reviewable on the standard of reasonableness. Indeed, the standard of reasonableness is concerned \"mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process.

The Applicant further submits that the Board's reluctance to replace the interpreter reinforced the apprehension of bias.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "The test for a reasonable apprehension of bias was set out by the Supreme Court in", "Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 394: whether an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - would conclude that it was more likely than not that the decision-maker, consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.

With respect to the first interpreter's inexperience, the Applicant has failed to demonstrate that there were in fact translation errors upon which the Board relied. When the Board determined that the first interpreter indeed had an inadequate knowledge of technical terms pertaining to the practice of Christianity, it ensured that a more experienced interpreter was brought in.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "Furthermore, as the Respondent points out, the Applicant's counsel at the hearing did not raise a specific objection to the use of the testimony translated by the first interpreter. The law requires that allegations of bias be made promptly, so as to allow the decision-maker the opportunity to recuse him or herself, and to save scarce judicial resources (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 1130 at para 17). It has further been held that the Court cannot intervene where the criticism of translation services is raised after the hearing and no evidence of its inadequacy is provided (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  6 Imm LR (3d) 107 at para 9). The Applicant's failure to raise an objection to the use of the testimony given with the assistance of the first interpreter prior to this hearing precludes her from relying on this argument.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "The Applicant further contends that the Board imposed a particular view of Christian doctrine and text on the proceedings. Incorrectly revising the Applicant's understanding of a Biblical passage, the Applicant posits, showed the Board Member's adherence to a particular dogma, which was akin to pre-writing the decision. I cannot accept the Applicant's arguments on this point. Asking the Applicant questions about her beliefs and her Biblical knowledge was an important exercise given the facts of the case. The Member was not \"interpreting\" the Biblical passage in question, but rather was asking the Applicant a pointed question about what was contained in the text. While a focus on this particular point may not be a reasonable ground, on its own, to discredit the Applicant's contention that she is a Christian -- a point that will be discussed in more detail below -- it was not the only factor the Board took into account, and does not amount to an apprehension of bias.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "B.", "Christian Identity  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "The Applicant submits that the Board erred in its determination of her Christian identity by:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "a) substituting a test of \"motivation for adherence\" for \"sincerity of belief\";  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "b) applying a demanding standard for textual and doctrinal knowledge;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "c) applying preconceived concepts of dogma;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "d) relying on a mistake of fact with respect to Biblical text; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "e) failing to give weight to evidence of Christian identity such as baptism, church attendance, recital of prayers, Biblical familiarity, and proselytizing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "Determining whether the Applicant is a practicing Christian, as she suggests, is an exercise for which considerable deference is owed to the Board, the trier of fact.

Given the facts of the Applicant's case, I am satisfied that the Board's decision on this point, when considered as a whole, falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "I acknowledge that the Board's detailed questions about the miracle of Jesus turning water into wine may have been far-reaching, particularly since the questions did not pertain to the central tenets of the Applicant's religious belief. The questions do not amount to the level of capriciousness or arbitrariness, however, given the Applicant's testimony that she reads the Bible - specifically the New Testament, where this story is found - ten hours each week, and attends Bible study classes. In any event, this particular line of questioning is not the sole basis on which the Board crafted its conclusion. A far more problematic point for the Applicant is her declaration that the Holy Spirit is not God - a proposition that can much more readily be considered a basic tenet of Christianity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "The Board was entitled to give little weight to the evidence of the Applicant's participation in church activities, and of her baptism. Indeed, the Applicant cannot ask the Court to reconsider the Board's weighing of the evidence where she does not agree with the outcome. In addition, this Court has held that \"motive is a relevant consideration in gauging the sincerity of the applicant's beliefs\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 9). It was thus reasonable for the Board to consider the Applicant's motive in joining the churches to determine the sincerity of her beliefs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "C.", "Credibility  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[32]", "The Applicant contends that the Board erred in drawing a negative inference from the want of a summons issued by the PSB, despite the numerous purported attempts to arrest her.

Given the record before it, I am satisfied that it was reasonably open to the Board to conclude as it did.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[34]", "The Applicant contends that there is a \"possibility that the interpretation may not have communicated the difference between Sunday services and Bible study adequately. The Applicant stated that she attended the church 'only Sunday, Sunday course'.\" As I have already addressed the issue of the testimony given by the Applicant with the assistance of the first interpreter, I will not say much here. I would add only that, even were purported translation errors brought to the attention of the Board, they are not sufficient to render the Board's decision unreasonable. These terms are not particularly technical terms, and, more importantly, they do not offset the Board's credibility concerns arising from the Applicant's answers to its other questions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[35]", "While the documentary evidence suggested that the PSB's practice with respect to leaving a summons is not uniform, it does not directly contradict the Board's finding. Indeed, given the number of times the PSB was purported to have come knocking at the Applicant's door, and at that of her mother, it was reasonably open to the Board to conclude that a summons would have been left. The mere fact that it was possible for the Board to conclude the opposite does not, in and of itself, render the Board's decision on this point unreasonable (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 28).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[36]", "Finally, it was reasonably open to the Board to draw a negative inference from the Applicant's inability to remember details about her travel to Canada.

However, a finding that a claimant was motivated to practice a religion in Canada to buttress a fraudulent refugee claim cannot be used, in and of itself, as a basis to reject the claim. Rather, the finding that the claimant has been motivated by a desire to buttress his or her refugee claim is one factor that may be considered by the RPD in assessing the sincerity of a claimant's religious beliefs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[62] The sincerity of those beliefs will be an issue in cases, like the present, where continuing the religious practice in the country of origin might place the claimant at risk. If the beliefs are not genuine, then there is no risk, as a claimant would not practice his or her newly-acquired religion in the country of origin if adherence to the religion is motivated solely by a desire to support a refugee claim. On the other hand, there may well be situations where a claimant might initially have been motivated to join a religion due to these types of motivations, but along the route, may have developed faith and become a true adherent of the religion. This appears to be what occurred  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(cited above at para 10), where the claimant originally began practicing Christianity to fuel his refugee claim, but later went on to join the priesthood in the Mormon church.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[39]", "The Board's decision with respect to good faith is reasonable in this case for two main reasons: first, as Justice Gleason underlines in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the burden of establishing the sincerity of her beliefs rests with the Applicant (para 69). The Board's conclusion that she did not do so was based on its assessment of her credibility, which I have already determined was reasonable. Given this context, I find, as  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ", that the Board's errant reliance on Mr. Hathaway's book (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 217 at para 29;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 67) does not outweigh the reasonableness of the decision as a whole. Second, and in a similar vein, the Board's comments about good faith were not determinative of its overall decision.

First, the Board relied on the absence of documentation with respect to lay person arrests in Guangdong province to conclude that the Applicant would not face persecution were she to return to China to practice her religion.

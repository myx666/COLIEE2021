She first claimed refugee status in April 1999 under a false name. This claim was not pursued but her misrepresentation was discovered when she made an application for landing on humanitarian compassionate grounds using her real name. Having admitted that she had lied previously, she reopened her abandoned refugee claim under her own name in July 2000."], ["[4]", "The decision of the Board rejecting the claim under ss. 96 and 97 of the", "Act", "is brief. The Board first states that it is not satisfied that there is sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence upon which to make a positive determination. It reviews the impact of Mrs. Ghasemian's representation in presenting her first claim under a false name and reviews the explanations given for her behaviour concluding that it is not satisfied with those explanations."], ["[5]", "It then looks at why the applicant did not make a claim in England back in 1996 during a trip to London with her husband and mother-in-law or why she did not attempt to leave Iran before 1998 given that she had a valid passport since 1997. The Board appears to accept Mrs. Ghasemian's explanation that she was at all times under the strict control of her former husband until her family persuaded him to let her visit them in Canada in September 1998. However, the Board draws a negative inference from her failure to claim refugee status until July 2000 (they disregarded her April 1999 claim), and states that such conduct is inconsistent with the well-founded fear of persecution."], ["[6]", "The Board does not comment any further on Mrs. Ghasemian's claim of spousal abuse or on the credibility of her testimony in that respect."], ["[7]", "After this, the Board reviews the claim based on her religious conversion and finds that the claimant's actions in Canada in this regard are \"implausible and inconsistent with the action of a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution\". To justify this conclusion, the Board simply states that it cannot accept the applicant's assertion that she was \"unaware of the consequences of her conversion when she came to Canada\". For the Board, the draconian measures adopted by the Iranian clergy, in condemning any form of religious expression other than their vision of Islam are well-known around the world and it is inconceivable that the claimant would not be aware of such restrictions, especially given her own testimony that she had Christian friends at high school who left the country due to fear of persecution. It found questionable that she would take the risk of a public baptismal ceremony. The Board concludes that it is not satisfied that the motive of the conversion was \"purely religious\". It was one more attempt to streamline her status in Canada."], ["[8]", "The Board did consider the testimony of Pastor Paul Gonsalves who stated that Mrs. Ghasemian attended regular church services and participated in various church programs. It held that this testimony was credible, and the Board accepted that Mrs. Ghasemian had been baptised."], ["[9]", "There was no analysis of the evidence presented to establish the objective element of the claim with respect to spousal abuse or the treatment of apostates in Iran.

First, although not determinative, it says so at the beginning of its decision. Second, the comments about the impact of her misrepresentation and her delay in claiming refugee status while in London or prior to 1998 or upon her arrival in Canada, clearly relates to her alleged subjective fear of her husband given that until September 3, 2000, the date of her conversion, this was the only basis on which she could make a claim."], ["[14]", "The absence of a subjective fear is fatal to a claim under s. 96 of the", "Act", ".

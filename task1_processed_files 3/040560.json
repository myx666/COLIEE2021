What was awarded to the applicants-a pension retroactive to October 30, 2004, and an additional award of 24 months-is the maximum permitted under the Act. Section 85 itself is very limited. The jurisdiction conferred on the Minister can be exercised only where an application for an award has already been the subject of a determination by the Board. This Board, a creature of statute, has jurisdiction only with respect to pensions.

Section 85 cannot be interpreted as giving the minister the outrageous power of ignoring the Act such as providing an award for an alleged fault that the Board itself cannot consider. The very wording of subsection 56(2) seems to describe the situation in this case, and the Board has already awarded the maximum that the Act provides for these cases."], ["[35]", "Indeed, the Act expressly limits the minister's power to considering an application for an award, this term being defined as \"a pension, compensation, an allowance or a bonus payable", "under this Act", "\" (my emphasis). Both the terms \"pension\" and \"compensation\" are also defined in the Act. With respect, the minister's power is very limited, and it is highly doubtful that he or she could rely on this section to go beyond what the Act has set out so explicitly. Furthermore, I fail to see how the Board could send to the minister what it does not have the authority to deal with itself. The application must be for an award, this term itself being defined and limited by the Act.

The rejection of this possibility by the Board arises, in my view, from the reasonable decision, the standard of review applicable to a discretionary decision that is squarely within the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal that has expertise in the matter. The refusal to use section 85 was entirely reasonable; in my opinion, it was necessary because the Act provides for a possible remedy in the applicants' situation. If another fault was committed, other than an administrative difficulty beyond the control of the applicants (subsections 39(2) and 56(2) of the Act), it must be adjudicated in another forum since it does not come under the Board or the minister.

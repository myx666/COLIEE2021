In response to the section 45 notice, the Respondent filed the affidavit of its President, Peter Ambühl. Subsequent to an oral hearing, the Hearing Officer rendered a decision in which she concluded that the Respondent had demonstrated use of the trade-marks in Canada in the three years preceding the date of the notice and declined to expunge the registration."], ["[3]", "The following summary of the evidence is taken from the Ambühl affidavit. The Respondent, Sissel Handles GmbH (Sissel Handels) acquired the SISSEL registrations and the business relating to products bearing the SISSEL trade-marks from the previous owner of the registrations, Sana Handels AG, on July 8, 2003. Sissel Handels manages and coordinates the worldwide manufacturing and distribution of products bearing the trade-marks at issue including pillows.

He also states that \"[as] Sissel-Online Ltd. (Canada) and Sissel, Inc. (U.S.A.) are operated by the same people, and as I understand Sissel-Online Ltd. shares a warehouse with Sissel, Inc. some correspondence and invoices for products purchased by Sissel-Online Ltd during the relevant period were forwarded to Sissel, Inc. in Washington.\""], ["[6]", "He also states that \"[i] n accordance with the distribution arrangement in place between Sissel Handels and Sissel-Online Ltd., Sissel-Online Ltd. filled orders for pillows placed by Canadian end-users by placing orders directly with Foam AB.

In his affidavit he states that these invoices \"are representative invoices evidencing sales in Canada of pillows bearing the marks SISSEL and SISSEL & Design from Foam AB to Sissel Online Ltd\" during the material time. He also states that a number of invoices were forwarded to Sissel, Inc. because of the close relationship between Sissel, inc. and Sissel-Online Limited. The invoices are addressed to Sissel-Online, LLC at PO Box 729 in Sumas, Washington and the invoice indicates a delivery address to Sissel, Inc. at an address in Sumas, Washington."], ["[8]", "Mr. Ambühl deposes that \"[t] he pillows bearing the [trade-marks] and sold in Canada come in a variety of shapes and sizes.

Although the affidavit shows sales figures for Canada, there is no invoice evidencing an actual sale or delivery of pillows in Canada. The Applicant points out that the invoices appended to the affidavit as evidence of sales in Canada are to an entity known as Sissel-Online, LLC and the destination address for the invoice and the delivery address are to locations in the United States. As well, there is no reference to Canada in the invoices. Further, the affiant does not identify any Canadian company by the name of Sissel-Online, LLC or that Sissel-Online, LLC is a Canadian company."], ["[15]", "The Applicant submits that the Hearing Officer misapprehended the evidence of sales. First, she stated that the invoices were addressed to \"Sissel-Online LLC, the Canadian company\" when this entity was not referred to in the affidavit nor was it referred to as being a Canadian company associated with the Respondent. Secondly, she referred to the destination address as \"appearing\" to be that of a U.S. distributor, which in the Applicant's view supports an inference of sales in the U.S. but not in Canada. The Applicant argues that by \"treating invoices of sales to an entity in the US as being corroborative of the assertion of Canadian sales, the Hearing Officer failed to ensure that clear, precise, solid and reliable evidence of use was relied on to maintain the registrations\"."], ["[16]", "The Applicant submits that the quality of the evidence adduced in the present case is similar to the evidence adduced in the section 45 proceeding in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. (4th) 33. The Applicant argues that in that case, as in the present case, the Hearing Officer took the invoices as corroborative of sales of the wares as opposed to evidence of sales. On appeal, the Court held that this did not establish use of the trade-mark."], ["[17]", "The Applicant also relies on this court's decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [2008] F.C.J. No. 1194 where the Court held, at paragraph 20:", "The evidence provided by the affidavit must describe the use of the mark within the meaning of section 4 of the Act and should not simply state the use of the mark. The Registrar inferred that the sales of the wares occurred and stated that invoices for the sales of the machines were not necessary because the evidence, as a whole, showed the use of the mark. In my view, the Registrar did not have sufficient evidence before her to demonstrate the use of the mark."], ["[18]", "At this point, it is useful to reiterate some general principles in relation to section 45 proceedings that are relevant to the issue in this case. A section 45 proceeding \" is primarily designed to clear the register of dead wood, not to resolve issues in contention between competing commercial interests, which would be involved in expungement proceedings\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 241 (CA)."], ["[19]", "It is well established that in this type of proceeding it is not enough to simply assert use. A registrant must show use of the trade-mark in association with the wares for which it has been registered: (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 10).

The affiant explains that some correspondence for Sissel Online Ltd. was sent to the address of Sissel Inc, in Washington. Excerpts from the Canadian section of the website are attached as Exhibit G. Representative invoices are attached (Exhibit B) evidencing sales from the registrant's manufacturer to the Canadian distributor - Sissel-Online. It would appear that the invoices are addressed to Sissel-Online LLC, the Canadian company, but with an address in the United states that appears to be that of the US distributor Sissel, Inc. The affiant states however, that these goods were to provide the pillows for Sissel-Online LLC to fulfill it orders to Canadians. I find this explanation reasonable and satisfactory."], ["[22]", "In my view, the Hearing Officer did not misapprehend the evidence. It is evident from a reading of the Hearing Officer's reasons that she accepted that Sissel-Online Ltd. and Sissel-Online, LLC were the same entity. Although the Applicant is correct that the affiant does not specifically refer to an entity by the name of \"Sissel-Online, LLC\", the affiant explains that \"invoices for products purchased by Sissel-Online Ltd.\" were sent to Washington. The affiant also describes the invoices appended to the affidavit as being invoices for sales of pillows from Foam AB to Sissel-Online Ltd. This taken together with the fact that among the distributors in the U.S., Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada only the Canadian distributor uses  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  as part of its corporate name, leads me to conclude that the Hearing Officer did not misapprehend the evidence when she inferred that the addressee on the invoices, Sissel-Online, LLC, was the Canadian company, Sissel-Online Ltd.. Accordingly, it also follows, that contrary to the Applicant's assertion, the Hearing Officer did not rely on sales to an entity in the U.S. as corroborative of Canadian sales. Instead, she relied, in part, on the sales to the Canadian distributor as corroborative of Canadian sales."], ["[23]", "Having regard to the statement in the affidavit regarding the approximate volume and value of the sales of the pillows bearing the trade-mark(s) coupled with the extensive evidence of related commercial activity in Canada it was reasonably open to the hearing Officer to concluded that the Respondent had met the burden of proving use during the material time."], ["[24]", "At the start of the hearing, counsel for the Respondent drew to the Court's attention the fact that the requesting party in the section 45 proceeding is not the Applicant before the Court in this proceeding. The Respondent took the position that if Sissel-Online Ltd., the Applicant, wished to challenge the decision, it should have done so by bringing an application for judicial review. Although the Respondent had not raised this question in its memorandum of fact and law, the Applicant made responding submissions and I heard the matter on its merits. As I have concluded that the appeals should be dismissed, a consideration of this question in these reasons is unnecessary."], ["[25]", "For the above reasons, the appeals will be dismissed with costs to the Respondent.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[26]", "THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that", "the appeals in Court files T-1060-08 and T-1061-08 are dismissed with costs to the Respondent.", "[End of document]"]]}

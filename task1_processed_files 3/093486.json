The usual cause of arterial narrowing is a gradual build up of fatty material in the arterial wall. The fatty deposits can become calcified and hardened thereby producing plaque. This process is known as atherosclerosis. The plaque can protrude into the lumen of the artery and narrow it (this is known as stenosis). As the lumen becomes progressively more narrowed, the stenosis can lead to a complete or partial blockage (occlusion). The heart muscle fed by the stenotic artery then becomes deprived of oxygenated blood. This may eventually result in chest pain (angina). If the lumen of the artery suddenly closes off, blood flow ceases and results in a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or death."], ["[17]", "Arterial disease affects other organs as well. For present purposes, we are concerned with cardiac heart disease (ischemia). Until 1977, there were only two treatments for ischemic heart disease: surgical coronary artery bypass grafting and drug therapy. Drug therapy is not relevant here."], ["[18]", "Surgery usually took (and takes) the form of open heart coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). During this operation, a graft is sutured across the site of the occlusion, providing an alternative pathway for blood flow. The graft usually consists of a blood vessel taken from another part of the body, preferably an artery. The procedure constitutes major surgery and involves general anaesthesia and significant trauma for the patient."], ["[19]", "In 1964, Dr. Charles Dotter reported having treated arterial narrowing in the peripheral leg arteries by inserting a series of increasingly larger diameter catheters through the femoral (thigh) arteries and, using x-ray screening, pushing them through the narrowed or blocked section. This procedure was labelled \"transluminal dilation\". It was performed under local anaesthetic. The label for insertion \"through the skin\" is percuntaneous. Dr. Dotter's method was limited by the fact that a channel only as wide as the arterial entry site could be produced. Additionally, the technique could not be applied to any arterial territory remote from the entry site (such as a coronary artery) because it was known that flexibility would be necessary to negotiate the bends involved. Dr. Dotter's paper entitled \"Transluminal Treatment of Arteriosclerotic Obstruction\" predicted eventual application of the technique to the coronary vessels."], ["[20]", "In 1977, after successful work in the peripheral arteries, Dr. Andreas Grüntzig first performed percuntaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (angioplasty)."], ["[21]", "This angioplasty procedure involves passing an outer catheter called a guide catheter through the skin (most often through the femoral artery in the groin or an artery in the arm) under x-ray control and steering it to the main coronary artery. Radio-opaque fluid, injected through the catheter, reveals the lumen of the vessels and their branches. A fine guidewire is passed through the catheter into the coronary branches and is steered, again under x-ray control, through the arteries to the diseased portion of the coronary artery. Over the guidewire, a catheter with a balloon is passed so that the balloon is placed at the site of the stenosis. Once in place, the balloon is inflated. This forces the occluded artery open, pushes back the plaque and deforms the arterial wall. The balloon is then deflated and removed. Balloons of varying inflated diameters and lengths are used, typical dimensions being 2.5 - 4 mm inflated diameter and 20mm length."], ["[22]", "Angioplasty has the advantages of low morbidity, rapid recovery time and repeatability. It gained ground rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s. However, it also has associated complications. The method can involve occlusion (due to the tearing of the vessel wall, that is, the lining of the artery, specifically the endothelium) and consequent dissection in the endothelium creating a false passage or \"flap\" (which can close off the true lumen). This serious complication often requires emergency surgery. Additionally, restenosis (recurrence of the narrowing) can occur during the weeks or months after the procedure."], ["[23]", "During the 1980s, as a result of the problems associated with angioplasty, researchers explored several different alternatives, including lasers, atherectomy devices and stents. Stents act as a support in the artery."], ["[24]", "Dr. Dotter had tried implanting metal spirals in animal arteries but thrombosis (blood clotting) was a problem. He turned to coiled springs initially made of stainless steel and later, nitinol (an alloy made of nickel and titanium). This alloy is described as a \"memory metal\". Its physical properties are such that it can be fashioned into a particular shape at its \"memory\" temperature, cooled so that it then effects another shape, but when the \"memory\" temperature is applied to the metal, it returns to its first shape."], ["[25]", "In 1984, Maass et al. reported the use of spiral-shaped stents made of heat-treated steel alloy, configured as a double-helix spiral, torsion-reduced in diameter and transluminally inserted in the vena cava or aorta of dogs or calves. When wound tightly, the springs became narrow in diameter to allow them to be delivered into and through the lumen. Once released, they sprang back to their original size whereupon they pressed themselves against the vessel wall by elastic expansion."], ["[26]", "In 1985, Dr. Cesare Gianturco and co-workers reported their work with a stent (known as the Gianturco Z-stent), made of stainless steel wire formed in a zig-zag pattern, which they placed in major vessels of dogs. The stent features a metal wire folded numerous times such that it forms a spring-type, zig-zag pattern which springs open and expands upon being pushed from a catheter sheath. The sheath is then withdrawn. Once released from the sheath, the stent expands until the force of the stent on the walls of the vessel is in equilibrium with the force of the vessel wall on the stent. If the fully-expanded diameter is greater than that of the desired size of the lumen into which it is placed, it may cause undue injury to the vessel. This stent was not used in humans."], ["[27]", "Around 1986, the Wallstent became generally known. It is constructed of stainless steel braided wire mesh. It, too, is a self-expanding stent. It was held in a protective sheath and was implanted in dogs, mainly in the coronary arteries. The Wallstent is flexible and does provide some vessel support. However, its closed structure leads to side branch closure and the fact that it shortens on expansion (known as foreshortening) in an unpredictable fashion renders it less than ideal. Wallstent devices were also implanted in humans."], ["[28]", "During the 1980s, Dr. Julio Palmaz produced two balloon-expandable stent designs. One was made from soldered wire and another was characterized as a \"slotted-tube\" stent. Only the latter became commercially available. During 1986, the Palmaz stent became generally known to all those interested in interventional radiology and interventional cardiology. The Palmaz slotted-tube stent suffered from longitudinal inflexibility and the Palmaz-Schatz stent was introduced to overcome this difficulty. The Palmaz-Schatz stent consists of a series of Palmaz slotted-tube stents joined by a connector(s). In the 1990s, two major clinical trials, the Benestent and the Stress trials, were conducted in Europe and the United States at multiple centres on large numbers of patients. These trials tested the safety and efficacy of the Palmaz-Schatz stent as a treatment for coronary artery disease."], ["[29]", "Also during the mid-1980s, Dr. Roubin was working with Dr. Gianturco in the development of another stent, the Gianturco-Roubin balloon-expandable coil stent. It is a stainless steel length of wire formed into a coil. Practitioners in the field were aware of the Gianturco-Roubin stent by 1986. Although very flexible, its disadvantage is that it provides poor support and scaffolding to the vessel."], ["[30]", "Variations of coiled stent designs were subsequently developed.

In his introduction to the '505 Patent, Dr. Palmaz calls out some prior art stents, which he says are intraluminal vascular grafts (transcript, p. 269). By 1991, the term of art for a balloon-expandable stent was a \"stent\" and has remained so.

Dr. Buller explained that this means \"within the lumen\". He described \"intraluminal delivery\" as a term of art meaning delivery by a non-surgical procedure. Intraluminal delivery is the means by which a device can be delivered to a distant, remote point to treat a body passageway through the passageway itself, rather than through surgical opening (Dr. Buller, transcript, p. 293). Thus, intraluminal delivery means that the tubular member arrives at the desired location in the body passageway by being passed within and along the inside of the body passageway. Dr. Prendergast, in his description of the first diameter of the Palmaz stent, said \"[it] is the diameter in the delivery state, which permits delivery of the stent into a body passageway having a lumen\" (Dr. Prendergast, Expert Report)."], ["[106]", "I construe the phrase to mean that the first diameter permits the placement of the tubular member at the desired location by passing it within and along the inside of a body passageway."], ["[107]", "\"Second expanded and deformed diameter\" refers to the diameter of the tubular member after it is expanded into a new, larger shape.

It means permanent change. The disclosure states that the term means that the material from which the stent is manufactured is subjected to a force which is greater than the elastic limit of the material utilized to make it ('505 Patent, p. 15). A skilled person reading the patent would understand that the term \"deformed\" is used to explain that the metal of the stent must be plastically deformed to permanently maintain its second diameter. Otherwise, the stent would spring back to where it was (Dr. Prendergast, transcript, p. 2799). Therefore, the phrase means that the tubular member has a second diameter that is permanently larger in size than the first diameter."], ["[109]", "In relation to coronary artery stents specifically, the diameter of a stent (before it is inflated) is about 1 mm (Dr. Strauss, transcript, p. 194). The stent is expanded to about 3 mm, the degree of expansion being controllable. The range for the diameter of an expanded stent would be 2.5 mm to 4 m., sometimes larger.

This term is understood to mean a force directed outwardly from the inside of the tubular member as illustrated by the arrows in the figure from Dr. Buller's Witness Statement reproduced below. The arrows represent a force from the inside pushing outwards. Although the diagram gives the impression that it is merely at one point along the length, the force would be along the entire length of the tubular member and it is this force that would produce the permanent bending or plastic deformation which enlarges the tubular member from the first diameter to the larger second diameter. (Dr. Buller, transcript, p. 300).", "[Diagram omitted - see printed version]"], ["[111]", "The preferred way of achieving this force is to use an angioplasty balloon inflated to high pressure. By placing an angioplasty balloon inside the structure and blowing it up to high pressure, the force required to permanently bend or plastically deform the device is produced. (Dr. Buller, transcript, pp. 300, 301). This would be the normal situation with respect to coronary artery stents. However, the patent does not require that the force be produced by a balloon. It also allows for the force to be produced by a series of mechanical levers. Dr. Cumberland believes, on reading the claim as a whole and in light of the description found in the patent, that it is apparent that the expansion of the graft is intended to be in the radial direction so that the graft can come into contact with the vessel wall (Dr. Cumberland, Expert Report)."], ["[112]", "I construe this phrase to mean \"upon the application of a force pushing radially outward\"."], ["[113]", "This force, which expands and deforms the tubular member, is \"variable and dependent upon the amount of force applied to the tubular member\". The evidence indicates that these terms mean that the second diameter can be varied, depending upon the amount of force applied to the tubular members. By adjusting the pressure in the balloon, the final dimension of the stent can be correspondingly adjusted. Inside the patient, \"you can adjust the final diameter by cranking up the pressure in the balloon, or by changing to a larger balloon and then making the device even larger\" (Dr. Buller, transcript pp. 250, 251). This provides control over the final dimensions of the stent. When Dr. Sigwart intensified the pressure (beyond that generally applied) to fully expand the Wallstent, his technique became known as the \"Swiss Kiss\" (Dr. Cumberland, Expert Report)."], ["[114]", "Consequently, this phrase means that the second diameter is variable and dependent upon the amount of force applied to the tubular member."], ["[115]", "This variable force, which expands and deforms the tubular member, must be such that it will \"expand the lumen of the body passageway\". The disclosure informs us that \"it should be understood that the methods and apparatus of the present invention are useful not only for expanding the lumen of a body passageway, such as an artery, vein, or blood vessel of the human vascular system, but are also useful to perform the previously described procedures to intraluminally reinforce other body passageways or ducts as previously described\" ('505 Patent, pp. 16, 17). Because the device is designed to remain in the body, it is evident that it is intended to expand and scaffold the lumen of the body passageway."], ["[116]", "This concludes the discussion on most of the non-contentious terms and phrases. The word \"intraluminal\" as it is used in claim 1 in relation to the \"expandable intraluminal vascular graft\" (or stent) is the subject of some debate. The plaintiffs' experts maintain that the term is intended to mean the placement of the device at the desired location in the body passageway by being passed within and along the inside of the body passageway."], ["[117]", "This view is based on the reasoning that \"lumen\" means the \"cavity of a tubular organ, such as a blood vessel or intestine\". Although I previously equated the \"lumen\" to the \"channel\" of the passageway, either description (cavity or channel), in my view, is appropriate. The plaintiffs say that the prefix \"intra\" means within. Therefore, \"intraluminal\" means the cavity of a tubular organ such as a blood vessel or other body passageway (Witness Statements of Drs. Buller and Stringfellow, Exhibits 3 and 4 respectively). On the last point, I do not understand the defendant's experts to say otherwise. The divergence in opinion arises as a result of Dr. Buller's reliance on the introduction to the '505 Patent."], ["[118]", "Dr. Buller opines that, in the introduction, Dr. Palmaz explains \"intraluminal vascular grafting\". In providing examples of prior art, he instructs the reader that this is a process of delivery, along a body passageway, to obviate the need for surgery. Dr. Palmaz taught that this whole field of development was to avoid subjecting patients to conventional open surgery and to allow for intraluminal delivery (sometimes called \"percuntaneous treatment\") to avoid such major surgery. Percetaneous means through the skin. Cutaneous is skin, and \"per\" means going through it. According to Dr. Buller, this procedure is done through the skin to distinguish it from a major, open surgical procedure. Thus, he understands the patent to be teaching that the device is delivered to the lumen and expanded there, in contrast to a surgical graft, which is used to bypass or replace a part (transcript, pp. 225, 268, 322)."], ["[119]", "The defendant's experts take the view that the word \"intraluminal\", when it is used to describe the vascular graft, describes the intended location. Dr. Cumberland claims that to import intraluminal delivery into the description of the graft imports \"in part a meaning that would not have been taken by a person skilled in the art either in 1991 or 1994\". He maintains that, in this context, \"intraluminal\" means that the tubular member is placed within a body passageway, such as a blood vessel. The term is intended to specify where the devices are used rather than their method of delivery (Dr. Cumberland, Expert Report). It does not presuppose any particular delivery (Dr. Cumberland, transcript, p. 1151). Mr. Opolski's view is that the addition of the \"intraluminal\" qualifier helps direct the skilled person as to where the device is to be used and conveys that the graft will be within the lumen of the vessel (Opolski Expert Report)."], ["[120]", "The word \"intraluminal\" appears twice in claim 1. At the outset, it describes the vascular graft. Later, when the first diameter is addressed, it states that the first diameter permits \"intraluminal\" delivery. Hence, at one point \"intraluminal\" modifies the word \"graft\". In this sense, it describes the graft itself and therefore, in this patent, its placement. However, \"intraluminal\" is also used a second time to modify the \"delivery\" of the graft. Because the adjective is used to describe different words, the question is whether it is to be given different meanings for its different contexts."], ["[121]", "As cautioned in", "Whirlpool", ", when a patent issues, it is an enactment within the definition of \"regulation\" in subsection 2(1) of the", "Interpretation", "Act", ", R.S.C. 1985, c.

When regard is had to the patent as a whole, that is, in context, the patent speaks to the \"invention\" as an alternative to conventional vascular surgery. It discusses percuntaneous insertion into a blood vessel. In more than one instance, it addresses delivery by way of catheter to the desired location. None of the devices discussed as prior art involved open surgery. Angioplasty itself was hailed as an alternative to surgery. The discussion of angioplasty and its disadvantages in the disclosure refers to the necessity of having a surgeon on call in the event of (complications)."], ["[124]", "It seems to me that one of the most fundamental aspects of the '505 Patent is that it avoids the requirement of open surgery. The foundation or premise upon which the device rests is intraluminal delivery. Thus, notwithstanding that the adjective \"intraluminal\" at the outset of the claim modifies the vascular graft, in my view, it is implicit that it is an \"intraluminal\" graft that is to be delivered \"intraluminally\". This notion is reinforced by the inclusion of the word \"intraluminal\" modifying the word \"delivery\" in claim 1. To determine otherwise, in the context of this patent, would indeed run afoul of Justice Binnie's admonition that a \"grammatical\" approach is to be avoided. Further, I cannot conceive of one reading the patent in its totality and not appreciating that \"intraluminal\" is intended to describe both the device and the delivery. To so construe the word does not broaden what is taught or disclosed in the disclosure. I prefer the evidence of Dr. Buller in this respect."], ["[125]", "Accordingly, I construe the word \"intraluminal\" to mean both the placement and the delivery of the device, the delivery being the passing of the stent within and along the inside of the body passageway.

So, if it's not thin-walled, it will block that passage of blood through; so it has to be thin enough so that the blood can freely flow through it\" (transcript, p. 680).

However, aside from this table of definitions (Witness Statements, exhibits 3 and 4 respectively), Dr. Stringfellow's evidence is largely devoted to the issue of infringement. He does endorse Dr. Buller's building block \"ring\" concept, but it is clear to me, and I find as a fact, that the notion of the building block \"ring\" is Dr. Buller's (in accordance with his interpretation of the patent).

Cumberland and Prendergast, and Mr. Opolski, for Boston Scientific, share the view that the tubular member in clam 1 of the '505 Patent is the functional graft (or stent), without a coating or anchor. The graft must include a tubular member and must be capable of functioning, as described in the patent, with one tubular member only. In brief, these experts interpret claim 1 as a reference to a single tubular member. They also say that the tubular member should be elongate to properly function as a stent, that is, the length of the stent is sized appropriately to scaffold a lesion in an artery. Boston Scientific notes Dr. Buller's evidence that the Palmaz stent came in a variety of lengths, all of which were longer than 7 mm. Dr. Cumberland cautions that if the tubular member were too short, there is a risk that it could tilt upon expansion. If a stent tilted upon expansion, it would not perform its supportive function. Moreover, it would lie in the blood stream, \"with thrombosis being a likely result\"."], ["[151]", "With respect to \"elongate\" this means that the structure has a length notably greater than its diameter. The Boston Scientific witnesses say that, although the claims do not specify a length for the tubular member, length is implicit because the claim describes the tubular member as having two parts or components: a wall surface and two ends. It is said that a skilled person would understand from this that the tubular member is not a ring."], ["[152]", "Boston Scientific's experts maintain that the tubular member is to be distinguished from a ring (the latter has a length less than its diameter, or an aspect ratio of less than 1). There is no magical line to determine the length of a tube versus a ring. However, the requirement for stability and the requirement for scaffolding is understood from the patent. The ring of half-slots (the \"building block\") is not elongate, could not be considered to be a tubular member and would not function as a stent. It would be either too short to act as a scaffold along the length of the stenotic region, or, if it were stretched to sufficient length, it would be too flexible and would collapse under the compressive force of the vessel wall. The ring of half-slots would not be sufficiently long to push open the artery in a way that would allow blood to flow through the vessel again."], ["[153]", "Further, a ring of half-slots (the \"building block\") would be prone to instability. Once the aspect ratio is less than 1, the stability is compromised (the lower the aspect ratio, the lower the stability). When the ring of half-slots is expanded, its aspect ratio is about 0.25 (like a wedding band) and a skilled person would not consider it to be tubular. Most lesions in the vascular system are about 10 mm in length. Typically, cardiologists want the stent to be slightly longer than the lesion so that the stent may extend somewhat on either side of the lesion. A tubular member that does not meet the basic functional requirements of a stent cannot be within the scope of the patent, which clearly relates to an implantable medical device. Once expanded, the ring of half-slots will be approximately 1 mm in length and 4 mm in diameter, hence the aspect ratio of approximately 0.25."], ["[154]", "In sum, on this point, the Boston Scientific expert witnesses maintain that the ring of half-slots does not provide scaffolding because it is not long enough to deal with the lesion on its own. Further, it would not provide protection against flaps or plaque coming down. The skilled person would know that the ring of half-slots would not function by itself."], ["[155]", "Next, the Boston Scientific experts maintain that the '505 Patent does not teach a ring of half-slots. There is no description, no illustration and no inference regarding such a ring. Since there is no hint, suggestion or teaching of a ring of half-slots in the patent, Boston Scientific contends that it is not open to me to construe the invention broader than it is disclosed."], ["[156]", "Moreover, based on the language of the patent, the shortest that the '505 Patent graft could be is one complete slot long. The patent depicts a stent that is 2 slots long. The structure of the '505 Patent is described clearly in slot lengths. Although it could be longer or shorter than the tubular member shown in Figure 1A, this is in reference to slots. Therefore, the skilled person would conclude that while the tubular member can be various lengths, the language of the patent and the functional requirements dictate that there be at least one complete slot in the stents described and claimed in the Palmaz patent."], ["[157]", "The plaintiffs dispute Boston Scientific's allegations. Drs. Buller and Stringfellow consider tube-like to mean hollow and generally cylindrical, but not necessarily elongate. If the tubular member is hollow, there is space inside the cylinder where blood can pass through. A circular cylinder is an example of a tubular structure that extends along a line known as the longitudinal access. Not all the attributes of a tube must be present for an object to be tube-like or tubular. Dr. Stringfellow unequivocally states that there is no magical dimension at which a structure ceases to become a ring and is then considered a tube."], ["[158]", "Johnson & Johnson's position regarding the capacity of the ring of half-slots to function as a stent emanates almost exclusively from Dr. Buller. Dr. Stringfellow considered that he was not qualified to respond to many of the questions regarding the efficiency of a ring-like tubular member in the practice of interventional cardiology."], ["[159]", "Dr. Buller points to the prior art of the '505 Patent and says that there is specific reference to intraluminal endovascular grafting as involving the use of a \"tubular prosthetic graft\". It describes structures which previously have been used as intraluminal vascular grafts as including \"expanding stainless steel stents formed of stainless steel wire in a zig-zag pattern\". This is the Gianturco Z-stent. The larger diameter Z-stent (referred to in the Wallace article and relied upon by the defendant for purposes other than construction) had a length to diameter ratio of 0.625:1. Thus, in March of 1991, Dr. Palmaz was including devices having a length to diameter ratio of 0.625:1 within his meaning of the term \"tubular\"."], ["[160]", "Dr. Buller notes that the AVE Micro Stent PL, the first generation of AVE's commercial stent, had short tubular rings which, alone, or in tandem supported a lesion. Johnson & Johnson claims that Mr. Opolski, on cross-examination, agreed that a Palmaz ring could work just as well as a Microstent PL 4 mm long. He also agreed that the patent does not say how many longitudinal parts are in the device. Further, ear grommets are somewhat more than 1 mm long and at least 1 mm in diameter. Dr. Prendergast acknowledges that his paper refers to a grommet generically as a ventilation tube. His paper sets out ranges for the dimensions of the ventilation tubes. For the low-level, the length of the device is 1.08 mm and the diameter or inner bore is 1.3 mm. Therefore the aspect ration (length to diameter ratio) of this tube is less than 1 (0.83:1). These devices for the eardrum have flanges, like ridges, to stabilize them in the anatomical position."], ["[161]", "In response to Dr. Cumberland's evidence relating to the difficulties associated with inserting stents in tandem (in sequence), Dr. Buller states that many times, he has enlarged lesions by using, in sequence, balloon-expandable stents that were shorter than the totality of the lesion.

The expanded tubular member would have a length (L) much small than its diameter (d).", "[Diagram omitted - see printed version]"], ["[163]", "As for Dr. Prendergast's FEA, Johnson & Johnson contend that the choice of a 15 mm long ring of half-slots would not have been a practical choice for a ring of half-slots that would work. It says that Dr. Prendergast acknowledges that he was not, in any way, attempting to make a Palmaz ring 15 mm long that would work. Rather, he was trying to make a 15 mm-long ring to use as a point of comparison to one that was shorter. That is, he was trying to measure the effect of lengthening the ring (building block) to illustrate, examine and quantify, the extent to which a lengthened ring will recoil after expansion. Shorter rings have higher resistance to elastic deformation. Therefore, there would be less recoil if the ring were made shorter."], ["[164]", "Johnson & Johnson emphasizes that the '505 Patent expressly provides, at page 14, that the graft can be made longer or shorter, as desired, than what is illustrated in the patent.

The introduction of the term \"half-slot\" for the alternating openings at the ends reinforces that the \"slots\" are bounded on all sides. The existence of the half-slot (not bounded on all sides and located at the ends) is inevitably due to the complete slots. Dr. Cumberland refers to the patent's description of slots as having both longitudinal members and short transverse connecting members. Hence, the slots are enclosed. Mr. Opolski maintains that the patent always refers to the entire opening - not part of the opening - as the slot. The language \"slots formed therein\" tells the skilled reader that the slots have to be fully enclosed by wall elements."], ["[174]", "Further, the Boston Scientific experts opine that the term \"slot\", as it is used in the Palmaz Patent, refers to an opening that is substantially regular in shape. If the slots are not of the same general size and shape, then it would be expected that the expansion of the stent would not be uniform, but irregular. Moreover, if there is only a half-slot, there are not two ends to the structure and connecting member 77 does not exist. A structure of only half-slots does not have any connecting members. To eliminate slots (as complete slots) is to eliminate the connecting members. The only slots 82 labelled in Figure 1A are two complete slots 82."], ["[175]", "The Boston Scientific experts note that half of a slot is not bounded and is located at the ends.

Thus, the '505 Patent calls out that \"slots\" include \"whole slots\" or \"complete slots\" and \"half-slots\". Both are called \"slots\". According to Dr. Buller, it is important that the patent says that \"complete slots\" and \"half slots\" are both slots - they are just different types of slots. The wall surface extends from one end to the other and the half-slots are clearly within that surface. Therefore, the alternating or half-slots are in the wall surface of the structure. Thus, both the full (complete) slots and the (open) half-slots are within the wall surface.

Yet, if the tubular member is only part of the graft, it need not function as a graft or prosthesis on its own. The United States Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit, in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision noted earlier, interpreted the word \"comprising\" as being \"open\" rather than \"closed\".

Although the graft or prosthesis as a whole must still function as such, the tubular member part of it need not function as the graft or prosthesis on its own. Since it need not function on its own as a graft or stent, the tubular member in the '505 Patent can use the rest of the structure of the graft or stent to support it.

There, the claims of the patent are construed during a Markman hearing. The file wrapper is given significant emphasis whereas extrinsic evidence, while within the discretion of the judge, is regarded as less reliable than the prosecution history in determining how to read the claim terms. Generally, the construction is concluded without the benefit of expert testimony. Witnesses at trial are confined to the definitions contained in the Markman Order. That is not the situation in Canada."], ["[201]", "The result is that responses to questions in the United States are, of necessity, premised on the Markman definitions.

He evaded questions that could expose any frailties in his theory and was intent on reiterating his views, when he deemed it necessary, irrespective of whether those views were responsive to the questions at hand. In short, Dr. Buller's repetitive emphasis on those areas favourable to his interpretation and his reluctance to respond to certain questions asked of him was most unhelpful. While Dr. Buller could, and should, have been of great assistance (which is the function of an expert witness), he fell short in this respect. Although well-qualified, his credibility was compromised as a result of his responses, or lack of them."], ["[204]", "Although Mr. Opolski's evidence was also helpful, his tendency toward verbiage led to confusion.

His qualifications are impeccable, he has devoted his life (to date) to academia and research, and he has no previous involvement in this, or analogous, litigation.

The expert witnesses did likewise. While it seems to me that my task would be far easier if regard could be had to the '186 Patent (an improvement of the '505 Patent) to assist in ascertaining the meaning of the '505 Patent, given the law discussed earlier, I do not believe such an option is available. Consequently, my construction of the '505 Patent is totally independent of the '186 Patent."], ["[207]", "The debate regarding the word \"comprising\" arose at the trial. The affidavits of Drs.

Although Dr. Cumberland states that he reads \"includes\" as meaning \"consists of\", he also says that it is fair to say that it could mean \"includes, but not limited to\". Mr. Opolski is more equivocal and would restrict any items in addition to those delineated in claim 1 to those described elsewhere in the claims (coating and anchors).

That is what Canadian law requires."], ["[210]", "Johnson & Johnson maintains that the tubular member in the '505 Patent can use the rest of the structure of the graft or stent to support it. Again, I do not disagree. My question is: what is there in the '505 Patent claims that would support it? None of the plaintiffs' witnesses were responsive in this respect. Rather, they pointed to examples of other grafts (such as the Parodi & Palmaz AAA graft) where the tubular member was merely a part of the graft. Many hypothetical questions were asked of the defendant's experts regarding the Dacron sleeve of the Parodi & Palmaz graft. These explorations are of limited assistance in addressing the context in which the word \"comprising\" appears in the '505 Patent. The same is true for the other examples provided by the plaintiffs. Those examples must be viewed in the context of the patents applicable to them."], ["[211]", "The plaintiffs say that if a device includes one thing, \"surely a device with more than one thing can be said to include that one thing\". That may well be so. The specific examples proffered by the plaintiffs were \"two or three tubular members in tandem\", or \"two tubular members connected\". My assessment is that if more than one tubular member is required for the graft to function, then the claim must provide for it. Similarly, if the connector connecting two tubular members is required for the functioning of the graft, then the connector would have to be delineated in the claim."], ["[212]", "The plaintiffs concede that the tubular member can be the claimed graft or prosthesis in the '505 Patent. I conclude that it is more likely than not that this is what is intended. While the plaintiffs are correct that a dependent claim cannot narrow the scope of an independent claim, there is a presumption of claim consistency, that is, the same words are given the same meaning throughout the claims. Independent claims must be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the claims that are dependent upon them. When regard is had to the claims of the '505 Patent, each claim that refers to a tubular member (which in claims 2 through 11 is the tubular member in claim 1) refers to \"the tubular member\" expressed in the singular rather than the plural. This constitutes, in my view, a compelling indication that the tubular member discussed in claim 1 is a single tubular member."], ["[213]", "In sum, while I agree with the plaintiffs that \"comprising\" should be construed as meaning \"including, but not limited to\", if the graft requires a specific element in order to function, that element must be found within the claim.

I am cognizant and mindful of the plaintiffs' admonition that the words \"preferably\" and \"may\" are permissive and not mandatory. Similarly, I am aware that the ambit of the monopoly claimed cannot be diminished merely because, in the disclosure, the patentee has described the invention in more restricted terms than in the claim itself. Nor should the claims be limited to the specific examples or embodiments described in the patent. I regard these principles as aids to assist in arriving at a determination as to the proper meaning to be given to the word \"slot\". The ultimate exercise remains one of ascertaining the patentee's intention on a reading of the patent as a whole."], ["[215]", "There is no debate that both terms, \"slots\" and \"half-slots\", appear in the disclosure portion of the patent. The claims, however, refer only to \"slots\". The meaning to be accorded the term \"slots\" is crucial. It is my view that the word \"slots\" in claim 1 means a complete slot. It does not include a half-slot. I arrive at this conclusion for a variety of reasons."], ["[216]", "The patent is replete with references to \"slots\". These \"slots\", as taught by the patent, are formed within the wall of the tubular member. They are defined as encompassing an opening whose length is substantially greater than its width, such as an \"elongated oval opening\". The uncontroverted evidence is that an oval (or a rectangle as depicted in Fig. 1A) is, by its nature, fully bounded on all sides."], ["[217]", "In the preferred embodiment, the \"slots\" are assigned the number 82. The content of the disclosure, where the preferred embodiment is discussed, uses the terms \"slots\" and \"slots 82\" interchangeably. Notably, slots 82 are complete slots."], ["[218]", "At page 13 of the patent (Detailed Description of the Invention), it states that \"each slot will have first and second ends with a connecting member 77\". The openings at the ends of the tubular member (I will say more about these later) do not have first and second ends 77 because one side of the opening at each end of the tubular member (as contrasted with the end of the slot) is open. Although the plaintiffs argue that this language refers only to the preferred embodiment and thus is not a required characteristic, I do not find that submission persuasive. The word \"preferably\" appears at various times throughout the disclosure thereby indicating that the language that follows is not mandatory. However, the reference with respect to first and second ends on page 13 of the patent is not prefaced by the word \"preferably\"."], ["[219]", "It is useful to examine the context in which the word \"half-slots\" actually appears in the patent. Notably, despite profuse references (in excess of 40) throughout the patent to the term \"slots\", the reference to \"half-slots\" appears only once, at page 14, where the ends of the tubular members are being described. That reference reads:", "\"Alternating slots disposed about the circumference of tubular member 71 at both the first and second ends 72, 73 of tubular member 71 will only have a length equal to approximately one-half the length of a complete slot 82, such half-slot 82 being bounded by members 78, 79, at both the first and second ends 72, 73 of tubular member 71. Although the graft, or prosthesis, 70 of FIGS. 1A and 1B is illustrated to have a length approximately equal to the length of two slots 82, it should be apparent that the length of graft 70 could be made longer or shorter as desired. Use of the term 'slot' encompasses an opening whose length is substantially greater than its width, such as an elongated oval opening.\""], ["[220]", "This reference, in my view, when regard is had to the patent as a whole, is intended to describe the ends of the tubular member (to which I indicated I would return). The word \"half-slots\" is used so that the reader is able to distinguish the \"slots\" referred to throughout the patent from the \"half-slots\" that are found only at the ends of the tubular member. As Dr. Prendergast and Mr. Opolski note, and I accept, the skilled reader would recognize that alternating openings at either end of the stent are necessary. Otherwise, a circumferential band of metal would be formed and would prevent expansion of the tubular member or stent."], ["[221]", "There is no disagreement that complete slots are bounded on all sides (unlike half-slots). My conclusion that \"slots\" means complete slots is, in my opinion, reinforced by other claims of the '505 Patent."], ["[222]", "Both dependent claims 5 and 6 refer to the \"expandable intraluminal vascular graft of claim 1\". Claim 5 refers to the slots having a substantially rectangular configuration in the first diameter and a substantially hexagonal configuration when the tubular member has the second, expanded diameter. Claim 6 refers to slots having a configuration which is substantially a parallelogram after the tubular member has been expanded and deformed into the second expanded diameter. The evidence is clear that a half-slot would not expand into a hexagon or parallelogram; it would expand into a trapezoid or triangle. The plaintiffs say that a dependent claim cannot be used to narrow the scope of the broader claim. I agree with that proposition. However, I do not see that claims 5 and 6, which specifically refer to the \"slots\" recited in claim 1, do any such thing. They simply confirm that the slots referred to in claim 1 are indeed bounded on all sides. Were it otherwise, they could not expand as indicated in the claims. Slots that are bounded on all sides are complete slots. Thus, the \"slots\" in claim 1 are complete slots."], ["[223]", "I find Dr. Buller's proposed definition of the word \"slots\" to be one that is contrived to accord with his theory of the building block \"ring\". In discussing the patent language that requires slots to be formed within the tubular member, he begins from the premise that \"half-slots\" are \"slots\". From there, he works in reverse and says because half-slots do not have material fully surrounding them (are not bounded on all sides), this negates any requirement that \"slots\" be bounded on all sides. For the reasons previously discussed, I reject this approach."], ["[224]", "I have not forgotten the plaintiffs' request that I construe the phrase \"slot\" in the same manner as it was construed in the United States. I respectfully decline to do so for essentially the reasons that I have provided earlier when I addressed the word \"comprising\"."], ["[225]", "I also reject Dr. Buller's building block \"ring\" theory. There is no indication, let alone description, in the patent regarding a ring of half-slots as the building block of the invention. Nor does the patent suggest, let alone teach, that the shortening or lengthening of the graft or prosthesis is to be accomplished through manipulation (Dr. Buller uses the word \"orientation\") of a ring of half-slots."], ["[226]", "Moreover, I accept the opinions of the expert witnesses Drs. Cumberland, Prendergast and Mr. Opolski (Dr. Stringfellow did not express any opinion in this regard) that in all likelihood, a ring of half-slots would be too short for a typical lesion, would not provide appropriate scaffolding, and would be prone to tilting upon deployment. These experts (Cumberland, Prendergast and Opolski) were unanimous in their view that the shortest permissible length of a functional Palmaz stent is a one \"slot\" (meaning a complete slot) stent."], ["[227]", "The plaintiffs do not confront this non-functional aspect head-on and I am left uncertain as to whether they dispute that the half-slot device would not work. Johnson & Johnson does, both in reply and during cross-examination of witnesses, refer to a stent manufactured by AVE (the Microstent PL), which was 4 mm in length and had no openings that were bounded on all sides. However, that reference does not resolve the problem. First, Boston Scientific's witnesses do not acknowledge that the Microstent PL functioned well. Indeed, Mr. Opolski, when asked if the half-slot ring could function as well as the Microstent PL, responds \"just as well or just as poorly\". It seems to me that the Microstent PL (on the evidence before me) did not fare well and was not regarded as a functional stent. Moreover, and more importantly, there is insufficient evidence (actually there is none beyond Dr. Buller's references by name) regarding any of these allegedly \"short functional stents\"."], ["[228]", "The remaining contentious issue is that of the tubular member being \"elongate\". Again, I do not intend to reiterate the arguments that have been previously detailed. The argument centres on the word \"tubular\" (which means tube-like) and whether a stent, having an aspect ratio of less than 1, is functional. There was much debate about this at the trial. Various pipes, tubes and tubing were examined. It is fair to say that, although no one was able to draw a magical line in the sand as to when a tube becomes a ring, the aspect ratio of 1 is regarded as extremely significant."], ["[229]", "It is common ground that the slots must be elongate. The question is whether the tubular member or stent must also be elongate. The patent, on its face, does not mandate that the tubular member be elongate. The defendant argues that it does so by implication."], ["[230]", "On the basis of the evidence (which was restricted to coronary artery stents) I am inclined to think that it is more probable than not that a coronary artery stent would not function well if its aspect ratio were less than 1. At the same time, the defendant's expert witnesses are unanimous that a one-slot stent falls within the parameters of the '505 Patent. Johnson & Johnson opines that a one-slot Palmaz stent would have a length \"much smaller than its diameter\". This allegation is supported by a pictorial diagram that was reproduced earlier and, for convenience, is again depicted here.", "[Diagram omitted - see printed version]"], ["[231]", "The difficulty is that the diagram does not purport to be drawn to scale, there are no measurements provided, and there is virtually no evidence to explain the statement."], ["[232]", "At the end of the day, I am satisfied that a tubular member that is not elongate would certainly not function well as a coronary artery stent. I am uncertain as to whether it would be totally non-functional. I do not regard the inquiry as one where I must determine whether one functions better than the other. Rather, it is whether the invention functions. My primary concern here is that the patent itself is not confined to coronary artery stents. As earlier noted, the invention is intended for various other body passageways. At page 11 of the '505 Patent, there is reference to use in the esophagus, the intestine, the bile ducts and other areas of the body. It may well be (or may not) that appropriate scaffolding in these areas would require a stent of a larger diameter than those in the coronary arteries. At pages 16 and 17 of the '505 Patent, there is further reference to the invention being used to intraluminally reinforce other body passageways or ducts."], ["[233]", "In the absence of some indication in the patent that the tubular member itself (rather than its slots) must be elongate, I am not prepared to construe the word \"tubular\" as requiring that the tubular member must be elongate in all cases. It must, however, be cylindrical and hollow."], ["[234]", "This concludes the construction of the contentious issues.

Moreover, it says that Dr. Buller acknowledges that a hollow tube would necessarily have a \"wall surface having a substantially uniform thickness\".

Mr. Opolski adds that it would also be clear that the stent is manufactured by cutting slots in a tube. The slots are rectangular in shape with the long dimension parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tube and upon expansion, the tube has a larger diameter with deformation of the slots."], ["[285]", "Dr. Cumberland notes that the concept of \"wall thinness\" is articulated in the 1983 Monograph as follows: \"The prosthetic tube wall should be adequately thin so as to avoid reducing the lumen of the tubular structure to be dilated by excessively increasing the total wall thickness\".

Boston Scientific contends that, since the length of the stent is not addressed in the claims of the patent, this \"feature\" is irrelevant to validity. In sum, its position is that the 1983 Monograph would allow a device manufacturer to design and manufacture the slotted-tube stent, as claimed in the '505 Patent."], ["[287]", "For the plaintiffs, Johnson & Johnson counter that the 1980 Monograph does not disclose all essential elements of the claims under consideration in the '505 Patent.

The left-hand and right-hand boxes are simply two different configurations of wires with a crisscross design. The central difference between them is simply that the figures in the left-hand box appear to be hinging (apparent from the difference in angle between the lines on the two figures) whereas the intersection of the wires on the diagrams in the right-hand box have been welded and, therefore, are forced to bend. Dr. Buller maintains that if one were to weld wires together and then compress the structure to a smaller size, one ends up with openings that appear much more rectangular. Comparing the diagrams in the right-hand box to Dr. Palmaz's woven, wire-mesh tube prototypes reinforces this conclusion. The wires in these prototypes are bending rather than just hinging. They no longer look like the simple crisscross drawing in the left-hand box of the Monograph."], ["[289]", "According to Dr. Buller, Mr. Opolski arrives at his conclusion that the device in the right-hand diagram of Figure 1 was made from a solid tube with openings in it with the benefit of hindsight.

Therefore, the device in the Monograph does not exhibit one of the essential elements of the '505 Patent: uniform wall thickness. Moreover, unlike the '505 Patent, the 1980 Monograph does not expressly teach that the outer surface of the device should be smooth. Page 5 of the Monograph suggests that the displacement of the tube might be prevented by giving it a fenestrated or corrugated surface and requires that the device be covered with a \"vascular prosthetic material\" such as porous polyurethane. Thus, the Monograph neither teaches using the metal on its own nor discloses something that is integrally formed. Dr. Buller reiterates his view (discussed earlier in the claim construction portion of these reasons) that the '505 Patent (unlike the 1980 Monograph) teaches that the tubular member can be part of a graft or prosthesis. The Monograph does not differentiate between graft, prosthesis and tubular members."], ["[291]", "In all, the plaintiffs submit that it is possible to make a wire-mesh device having a rectangular, uniform pattern of openings as illustrated in the left-hand diagram of the right-hand box in Figure 1.

Mr. Opolski maintains that he does not know how one would make such a structure to the small scale required of an intraluminal graft and even if it were possible, such a structure would not permanently deform. In the end, not much turns on this discussion.

This statement strikes me as describing the 1980 Monograph as a signpost", "on the way to the invention", ", rather than the flag where the invention is planted. A \"key kernel\" does not qualify.

Ultimately, the illustrations in Figure 1 are ambiguous. If the experts disagree, in their interpretations of the diagrams, it is highly likely that persons skilled in the art would disagree as well.

As noted by the plaintiffs, Mr. Schulz had, before him, materials other than the 1980 Monograph. Dr. Palmaz testified that he showed Mr. Schulz his cardboard model which, in my view, clearly demonstrates that Dr. Palmaz was seeking to make a tube from a flat sheet with slots cut out of it.

This content, in conjunction with Figure 1, is sufficient to inform a skilled person to cut elongate slots out of a tube. The 1983 Monograph goes so far as to specify that this could be done with electronic or laser etching."], ["[315]", "The 1983 Monograph contemplates the thinness of the wall since it notes that the prosthetic tube wall should be adequately thin (so as to avoid reducing the lumen).

In fact, the 1983 Monograph suggests that, in the vascular system, tube lengths should be limited to probably no more than 4 cm. Significantly however, a particular length of stent (or the freedom to adjust the length) are not essential elements in the '505 Patent claims and need not be disclosed in prior art documents."], ["[317]", "Assisted by the opinions of the experts, it seems to me that the 1983 Monograph discloses the essential elements of the '505 Patent for practical purposes.

He then soldered the criss-cross points to prevent hinging. These early prototypes were 3 cm long and 8 mm in diameter.

The sheet is then spot-welded to form a tubular sleeve."], ["[348]", "As noted, the Ersek sleeve can be expanded. When used for the fixation of heart valves, the sleeve is pre-assembled in the expansion tool (a device with resilient rings that compress and extend an outward force to the interior of the sleeve) and then introduced by way of incision in the aorta and passed along the lumen of the aorta to the required position. Dr. Cumberland claims that the device is placed intraluminally and then expanded. He says that it is sufficiently thin-walled for delivery in its first, unexpanded diameter and would be useful as an intraluminal vascular graft because it can be expanded with minimal encroachment on the lumen. The more the expansion tool's trigger is squeezed, the more the disks will bulge and the more the tubular sleeve will expand."], ["[349]", "The described procedure results in the implantation of the sleeve into the vessel wall. The tubular sleeve contains ribbon-like members that protrude into the vessel lining (to encourage the lining to proliferate through the open lattice work of the tubular sleeve) with the result that (after expansion) there is little metal coming into contact with the bloodstream itself.

In Dr. Buller's opinion, the intention behind the device was to accelerate major surgery by permitting an implanted graft to be stapled in place rather than laboriously suturing it to the body. It was to be used to attach a prosthetic device to the transplant situs; it was never meant to be used on its own."], ["[357]", "Further, Johnson & Johnson claims that the Ersek device fixes itself into the tissue wall by way of a \"plurality of longitudinally extending ribbon-like undulating portions\" (claim 1) that twist to extend angularly relative to the perimeter of the sleeve. The twisting of these ribbons causes the wall thickness of the sleeve to vary by a factor of at least two and thus, the wall thickness is not uniform.

Dr. Buller believes that this refers to smoothing or cuffing (hemming) the jagged, circumferential ends of the sleeve in order to allow the fixation device to enter the severed end of the aorta. It does not refer to smoothing the entire surface of the Ersek sleeve. To do so would be contrary to the teaching of the patent (to embed the ribbons into the tissue)."], ["[359]", "These narrow projecting edges point outwardly and inwardly. Johnson & Johnson contends that the edges render the Ersek device completely unsuitable for use as a coronary stent because it could injure and possibly rupture the vessel and the balloon (if a balloon were used for delivery). The sharp protruding ribbons, along with its overall size, prevent the Ersek device from being delivered intraluminally, as required by the '505 Patent. It cannot be said that the Ersek device has a \"first diameter\" that permits intraluminal delivery. Rather, the diameter generally matches the diameter of the tissue to which it is being connected."], ["[360]", "Moreover, the delivery device described in the Ersek Patent can only be used intra-operatively and not percutaneously. Although the patent states that a variety of expanding devices may be used, Dr. Buller notes that there are no obvious alternatives. The delivery device has a \"pistol, grip handle\" and a \"trigger-like operating lever\". When the lever is pulled, the device expands the sleeve \"in one stroke\" and only certain portions of the sleeve expand. Thus, the force applied to the sleeve is not controllable and the entire Ersek device does not take on a \"second diameter\". Because it is sized to match the implant and designed to embed (edge-on) into the vessel wall, it does not expand the lumen, nor does it support it structurally."], ["[361]", "Last, Johnson & Johnson submits that it is incorrect to say that the Parodi article describes Palmaz stents being used for the same purpose as the Ersek device because the Palmaz stent was not used as a \"staple-like device\".

In the Palmaz Patent, the word \"embed\" refers to expanding a stent against the vessel wall so that it is \"nicely in contact\".

I accept Dr. Buller's opinion that the patent's discussion of \"cuffing or smoothing the edges\" speaks to the circular ends, which will be forced into the implant and not to smoothing the entire surface because it would be contrary to Ersek's teaching. Dr. Cumberland agreed that the Ersek cannot be described as a low profile device without protrusions."], ["[366]", "In view of the evidence with regard to how the Ersek device embeds itself into the vessel wall, I am unable to conclude that the surface of the tubular sleeve is \"smooth\" as this element has been defined for the purpose of construing the '505 Patent. That is, it is not smooth enough for intraluminal delivery. The surface of the tubular sleeve is not smooth. More importantly, the tubular sleeve does not have a uniform thickness due to the rotation of the ribbon-like material, a fact that was also acknowledged by Dr. Cumberland."], ["[367]", "The Ersek device is not passed through the lumen to its intended location so it is not surprising that it does not have a first diameter which allows for intraluminal delivery before expansion. Its diameter is set, external to the patient, at a measurement that coincides with the diameter of the lumen. Its sleeve is expanded in one thrust and only where the doughnut-like rings press against it. I reject Dr. Cumberland's suggestion that Dr. Ersek must have intended for the entire sleeve to expand and that this could happen by altering the number of rings on the barrel of the gun. There is no indication in the Ersek Patent that the entire sleeve must expand. Moreover, the preferred embodiment depicts the expansion device with two rings, indicating that the sleeve will expand only in those two sections."], ["[368]", "Regarding the range of expansion issue, I have significant difficulty with Boston Scientific's position that the expansion device of the Ersek provides a range of expansion similar to the balloon expansion of the '505 Patent. Dr. Buller did agree that the more one squeezes the trigger of the Ersek expansion device, the more the rings will bulge. Although this is technically accurate, Ersek teaches the expansion of the tubular sleeve \"in one stroke\" to embed the projected metal edges into the tissue."], ["[369]", "The '505 Patent, on the other hand, teaches that (depending on the needs of the patient) the degree to which the stent should expand and the amount of force it should exact against the lesion and the artery wall can be controlled. There is no doubt that both the Ersek device and the Palmaz stent expand quickly. To the untrained eye, both may appear to be expanded in \"one stroke\". It is what is taught by the Ersek Patent and the purpose of the device that is crucial. I found Dr. Buller's testimony, on cross-examination, on this point persuasive. He notes that if an Ersek device were in use by a surgeon, the surgeon would \"not be looking at it on an x-ray or visualizing it. There is no purpose in adjusting it\"."], ["[370]", "Rather than making close contact with the lining of a vessel wall, the Ersek tubular sleeve is meant to implant itself into the surrounding tissue. The patent states, \"since the sleeve becomes incorporated into the tissue wall, no foreign material is left in contact with the blood\". This implantation occurs through the use of an expansion tool, which \"forces the fenestrations of the sleeve into the wall of the aorta to achieve a leak-proof union\". Although I do not necessarily agree that the Ersek device is \"stapling\" (as the word is commonly used), it is evident that the device is intended to", "penetrate", "the vessel wall", "immediately", ". Dr. Cumberland, when pressed on cross-examination, acknowledged that the part of the device that renders it not \"staple like\" is its failure to curve around the underside (like the prongs on an office stapler)."], ["[371]", "The Palmaz stent scaffolds the artery and, even after expansion, metal remains exposed. Over time, the stent will usually become covered with a layer of endothelium and grow to be \"part\" of the vessel wall. This is a gradual process. Both Dr. Palmaz and Mr. Opolski testified that the general attitude in the field, at the pertinent time was to minimize the amount of metal used in devices that were meant to remain inside the body. The evidence also indicates that Dr. Palmaz's designs were initially met with skepticism. It seems to me that it would be most unlikely that a skilled person would read Ersek and", "directly", "conceive of expanding a similar", "metal sleeve", "in the artery, yet not embed the metal into the tissue, for it would ignore the general attitude at the relevant time (\"the less metal, the better\")."], ["[372]", "There is also the issue of the ability to expand the artery. Dr. Cumberland acknowledges that there is neither discussion nor reference in the Ersek Patent with respect to expanding the lumen. Nor is the purpose of the Ersek device to dilate and support diseased vessels. I accept Dr. Buller's evidence that the Ersek device is not intended to scaffold the vessel wall and that its concept is substantially different from what a skilled person would be looking for in terms of an intraluminal stent (a smooth surface to facilitate delivery and support the vessel wall upon expansion)."], ["[373]", "I question whether the relevant skilled person would necessarily be aware of a patent in the general field of suturing devices, which appears to be outside the general area of angioplasty and intraluminal stenting.

It is not immediately apparent to me what I am to take from this. Dr. Cumberland's statement does nothing to enlighten me."], ["[375]", "The Parodi article reports the results of a study of animal experimentation and initial clinical trials exploring the feasibility of the use of the Palmaz stent in the treatment of AAA. I note that the Ersek Patent teaches no overlap between the Dacron graft and the blood vessel; the two abut ends. In the Parodi article, a friction seal is created by expanding the stent inside the Dacron graft then pushing the Dacron against the wall of the aorta. In other words, the graft goes inside the severed blood vessel (this is not the case in Ersek). The Palmaz stent does not have a multitude of projecting edges. Therefore, it holds the graft in place (in the aorta) in a manner different than the Ersek device."], ["[376]", "More importantly, the Parodi article is dated 1991 (some eight years after the date of the invention of the '505 Patent).

I find it difficult to envisage a situation where a subsequently recognized advantage to a claimed invention would be of any assistance in determining whether inventive ingenuity was required to make it. I can imagine a situation where the commercial success of an invention is attributable to a subsequently recognized advantage, but that would not assist the inquiry as to inventive ingenuity. I recognize that it is impossible to imagine every possible situation, but given the current state of the jurisprudence I would be inclined to give this factor no weight except in the most extraordinary case.\""], ["[377]", "I find that reasoning to be apposite to this issue and I subscribe to Justice Sharlow's view. The Parodi article does not assist me in determining the obviousness of the '505 Patent and I accord no weight to it in that regard. Further, I take nothing from Dr. Palmaz's use of the word \"embed\" in the 1983 Monograph. First, the word is to be read in its context, a proposition well known to, and repeatedly advanced by, Boston Scientific throughout the trial of this matter. The meaning of the word \"embed\" in the context of 1983 Monograph bears no similarity to its meaning in the context of the Ersek Patent. In any event and, at the risk of redundancy, it is the obviousness of the '505 Patent that is in issue.

The Palmaz stent, at the time, functioned better than other devices in the field aimed at remedying the same problem. The evidence of commercial success tendered by Johnson & Johnson was directed primarily to the '186 Patent.

While the Ersek Patent has characteristics or elements that could trigger ideas for those searching for an alternative to coronary bypass surgery, for the foregoing reasons, it does not follow that, after seeing the Ersek Patent, the skilled person would directly and without difficulty (and without employing an \"inventive step\") arrive at the '505 Patent.", "The '186 Patent"], ["[382]", "Boston Scientific does not allege that the '186 Patent was anticipated. It does contend that the '186 Patent is an", "obvious", "improvement, or alteration, of the '505 Patent.

He provides \"real-life\" examples (railway trains, subway cars) where a connector flexibly connects two rigid structures. He explains that, by making the rigid elements shorter, using more of them, and using connectors between them, the flexibility of the overall structure is enhanced."], ["[383]", "Dr. Cumberland and Mr. Opolski refer to the Wallace article, which they claim demonstrates that stents can be used individually or, that two stents can be connected by a wire strut and inserted together. According to Dr. Cumberland, the positioning of the two stents in Figure 3 of the article teaches that the bridge (strut) allows the two stents to be flexible (relative to one another), while at the same time, preventing migration. It is not totally clear from Figure 3 whether the flexibility occurs because the bridge itself flexes, or if flexibility occurs at the junction of the stent and the metal bridge. Regardless, Dr. Cumberland states that it would have been apparent to a person skilled in the art, upon reading this article, that two Palmaz stents could be connected by means of a metal bridge."], ["[384]", "In the Radiology article, Dr. Palmaz (and colleagues) discuss the lack of longitudinal flexibility of the wire mesh stent configuration. They state that the graft is limited to use in straight arterial segments. Curved arteries require the use of short graft lengths. The article indicates that problems, experienced with an excessively long graft, can be solved by using \"shorter grafts or grafts in tandem\". Dr. Cumberland claims that the meaning of \"tandem\" is not clear and offers two possibilities: mounting two grafts simultaneously on a balloon; or, implanting grafts separately, adjacent to one another."], ["[385]", "In Dr. Cumberland's opinion, neither arrangement is satisfactory. There are risks associated with multiple stents on one balloon. One stent may displace and migrate to another arterial territory or, the movement of the stents relative to each other during passage may cause gaps, or overlaps, between them. The process of placing separate stents, one at a time, is difficult and time-consuming. Moreover, it subjects the vessel to greater trauma. The plain and simple solution is to join the stents together with a single strut as a flexible connector. Dr. Cumberland notes that such a device was introduced as the Palmaz-Schatz stent. The Palmaz-Schatz stent solved the rigidity aspect of the original Palmaz stent and the attendant restrictions discussed in the Radiology article."], ["[386]", "Dr. Buller sees no ambiguity in the phrase \"grafts in tandem\" (in the 1985 Radiology article). He feels that a skilled person would understand the phrase to refer to the placement of two or more grafts end-to-end on the same angioplasty balloon. The solution to the problem of inflexibility proffered in the Radiology article was to use shorter graft lengths. There was no motivation to search for another solution. Because of the desire to minimize the amount of metal being put in the coronary arteries, one would not have been inclined to add metal (in the form of connectors) to the structure."], ["[387]", "Dr. Buller maintains that the Wallace article states only that two stents were connected by a wire strut. It provides little description of the connected stents. Increased flexibility is not an advantage of the design cited in the Wallace article. The article's abstract hints at the reason for connecting the stents: \"because of stent migration, designs are being tested to develop stents with greater stability\". Dr. Buller refers to the \"Charnsangavej Radiologoy\" article (by members of Dr. Gianturco's group), wherein the use of shorter Z-stents is suggested for the treatment of a long stenosis. The rationale is that shorter stents can provide greater expansile force and can help prevent the two Z-stents from de-stabilizing. Dr. Buller concludes that the purpose of connecting two Z-stents was to improve the stability of the device during delivery, not to promote flexibility."], ["[388]", "He further explains that, due to the nature of Z-stents as self-expanding springs, their orientation can change when they are ejected from the catheter. Joining two stents together permits greater stability and control because the second stent remains inside the catheter while the first stent expands. Unlike Palmaz's balloon-mounted stents, the Z-stents are expelled from the catheter by pushing. Any connecting strut must have axial rigidity to transfer the pushing force, stabilize the first stent released, and hold the Z-stents at the correct distance from one another. The struts depicted in Figures 2 and 3 of the Wallace article support this rigidity requirement since the wire of the struts appears thicker than the wire of the stents (and therefore is more rigid)."], ["[389]", "Moreover, without knowing the relative configuration of the Z-stents in Figure 3", "prior", "to insertion, Dr. Buller says that one cannot conclude that the alignment of the stents demonstrates the use of the strut to flexibly connect the stents. Even if the Wallace article taught one to connect stents, it did not teach the connection of other things (namely tubular members) in the way that the '186 Patent teaches. Therefore, it would not have been apparent to the skilled person, upon reading the Wallace article, to provide longitudinal flexibility to a balloon-expandable slotted-tube stent by flexibly connecting two or more tubular members together."], ["[390]", "Nor, in Dr. Buller's opinion, would it have been a common design choice to flexibly connect two rigid structures. In this respect, he refers to the sequence in which AVE introduced various stent products. First, AVE commercialized relatively short, non-connected rings mounted on a balloon. It then moved to connect the rings at the four adjacent points of each ring. It was only after the introduction of these two products that AVE introduced the GFC stent with one connection between adjacent rings."], ["[391]", "Relying primarily on the Duprat article, Dr. Buller notes that when the Gianturco group moved to the development of a balloon-expandable stent, it did not adopt the connected struts of the Z-stents. Instead, it used a spiral-coil design. Dr. Buller claims that this indicates that Gianturco did not consider the previous teachings in the Z-stent art to have any flexibility (including the connected Z-stents). The use of a connector to flexibly connect two stents was not the solution directly arrived at by Dr. Gianturco's team.

The justification for Dr. Buller's opinion is derived primarily from the Charnsangavej article.

I arrive at this conclusion for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: the inflexibility of the Palmaz stent was immediately apparent and solutions were sought to remedy it; numerous shorter stents were thought to give increased flexibility; the problems with migration, overlaps and gaps would have necessitated a means to keep multiple, shorter stents together; using connectors would have been obvious to the skilled person given the existence of not uncommon \"real-life\" examples where an articulation point is used between relatively rigid members to increase the overall flexibility of the structure; and, even if the idea of connectors would not have immediately occurred to the skilled person, the concept formed part of the prior art and public domain (the Wallace article)."], ["[406]", "I should mention that, in arriving at my determination that the '505 Patent was inventive and the '186 Patent was not, I have considered the commercial success and recognition gained by these patents.

This repeating pattern of irregular-shaped cells is depicted in the diagram below. I emphasize that it may be equally fair to say that the pattern below shows zig-zag rings connected together. Changing the names of its parts does not alter the manner in which the stent functions, nor does it alter my determination regarding infringement.", "[Diagram omitted - see printed version]"], ["[423]", "Each closed cell of the NIR stent is formed by a pair of opposite-facing horizontal or longitudinal \"C\" loops and a pair of vertical or circumferential \"U\" loops. One individual cell (with its components color coded) is set out below:", "[Diagram omitted - see printed version]"], ["[424]", "The integration of each cell with those next to it provides the NIR stent with \"uniform flexibility\" (probably the most notable benefit over prior stent models). The evidence of the Boston Scientific expert witnesses indicates that the U loops and the C loops cooperate in order to allow for this level of flexibility. The NIR stent owes many of its functional characteristics (including the ability to flex longitudinally at any point along the length of the stent) to this sharing of structural elements between the cells. The Us and Cs permit \"differential elongation\" on bending. More specifically, the U loops close when on the inside of a bend and open on the outside of the bend to permit the outside of the curve to become longer. This enables the stent (as a whole) to flex (bend) along its entire length."], ["[425]", "There is no question that the U loops contribute", "more", "to the NIR stent's flexibility, as compared to the C loops. Yet, I agree with Boston Scientific that both the Us and the Cs assist in the stent's flexibility. Indeed, the U loops and C loops collaborate in all phases of the stent's use (not only in terms of uniform flexibility, but also by assisting to provide radial strength and scaffolding functions). As all witnesses acknowledge, the Palmaz stent (in contrast) is very rigid."], ["[426]", "The integrated cellular structure also permits the NIR stent to foreshorten to a lesser extent than the stent of the Palmaz Patent. The tendency of balloon-expandable stents to foreshorten is offset by the cooperation of the U and C loops. As the C loops expand, their length will diminish, but the U loops compensate by lengthening. Thus, the overall length of the stent is maintained."], ["[427]", "Johnson & Johnson contends that the NIR stent has a plurality of \"slots\" as required by claim 1 of the '505 Patent. In support, it points to specific literature that refers to the NIR stent as a \"slotted tube\". (Notably, Boston Scientific does likewise in relation to its characterization of the NIR as being cellular and claims that the weight of the literature supports its view). The rationale underlying Johnson & Johnson's analysis of where the slots are located in the NIR stent is tied to the theory that the NIR stent is functionally divided into rings. These \"rings\" are illustrated, in red, in the diagram below.", "[Diagram omitted - see printed version]"], ["[428]", "Johnson & Johnson points to the \"openings\" in the \"rings\" of the NIR stent and claims that these openings are the \"slots\" as shown by the green markings in the figure that follows.", "[Diagram omitted - see printed version]"], ["[429]", "Further clarification in conceptualizing the portions of the NIR that Johnson & Johnson labels \"slots\" is provided by the blue portions of the diagram marked as Exhibit D-5.", "[Diagram omitted - see printed verison]"], ["[430]", "I have determined that the term \"slot\" (as it is used in the claims of the '505 patent) should be construed as meaning an elongated opening that is bounded on all sides, that is, a \"complete slot\". Although the graft of the patent contains what the patent refers to as \"half-slots\" in the first and second ends (I will say more about this later), these \"half-slot\" openings are not included in the term \"slot\"."], ["[431]", "The regions of the NIR stent that Johnson & Johnson attempts to label \"slots\" are open-ended. They cannot be \"slots\" (as I have construed this term). Although these regions in the NIR stent are longer than they are wide and are disposed generally along the longitudinal axis, they are not fully bounded on all sides. Therefore, they are not \"slots\". I note (peripherally) that these regions are not staggered circumferentially, although this feature is not essential to the claims of the '505 Patent."], ["[432]", "Johnson & Johnson's position is dependent upon the veracity of Dr. Buller's building block Palmaz ring hypothesis. I have rejected that hypothesis because it is not one that is contemplated by the '505 Patent. Dr. Stringfellow's evidence is not particularly helpful because it is premised on Dr. Buller's thesis. Dr. Stringfellow provides no indication that he subjected Dr. Buller's theory to any level of scrutiny. He merely endorses it. In contrast, the Boston Scientific experts provide cogent, detailed explanations and reasons as to why they reject the feasibility of the Palmaz ring theory. As previously stated, I conclude that Dr. Buller's hypothesis is not sustainable. Moreover, I find that it is contrived to find infringement."], ["[433]", "The crux of my determination is that there are no complete slots along the longitudinal axis of the NIR stent. Dr. Buller acknowledged that this is so. The absence of \"slots\", as the term is used in the '505 Patent (where it means complete slots), is inconsistent with the teaching of the '505 Patent. No embodiment of the '505 Patent would be made this way. Consequently, the NIR stent is missing an essential element from claim 1 of the '505 Patent."], ["[434]", "Also, first and second ends constitute an essential element of the '505 Patent. These ends are defined in great detail in the patent's disclosure such that they contain openings that are approximately half the size of complete slots. These half-slots alternate with the complete slots around the circumference of each \"end\" of the tubular member. This is evident from both the description of the first and second ends found on page 14 of the '505 Patent and from Figure 1A of the patent. In other words, the Palmaz Patent specifies that there will be \"half slots\" alternating with \"slots\" at each end of the tubular member. The NIR stent does not contain any \"slots\". Therefore, the first and second ends of the NIR stent are not the same as those of the '505 Patent."], ["[435]", "With respect to Johnson & Johnson's first \"infringement analysis\" (that the entire NIR stent is a tubular member), Boston Scientific does not disagree. However, the fact that the NIR stent is a tubular member does not eradicate the absence of \"slots\" in its wall surface. The absence of \"slots\" necessitates a conclusion of non-infringement."], ["[436]", "I have three observations regarding Johnson & Johnson's second infringement analysis. First, to accept it, I must also accept that each \"ring\" of the NIR stent is a tubular member. Tubular member has been defined as tube-like (cylindrical and hollow). As to whether a tubular member must be elongate, I concluded earlier that it is more probable than not that a coronary artery stent would not function well if its aspect ratio were less than one. In other words, a tubular member should ideally be elongate and the \"rings\" of the NIR stent (a coronary artery stent), as defined by Johnson & Johnson, are not elongate."], ["[437]", "Second, I have found that, although the word \"comprising\" is non-exhaustive, claim 1 of the '505 Patent must contain everything necessary for the invention to function. That is, even if one assumes that a NIR ring is a tubular member, it must be capable of functioning on its own (as a stent) in order to come within the parameters of the '505 Patent. The NIR stent is an invention in which many \"rings\" (to use Johnson & Johnson nomenclature) are joined together in order for the stent to function in a particular way. Since the other \"rings\" are necessary to the functioning of the device, it is not correct to isolate one ring and then attempt to fit the entire NIR stent within claim 1 of the '505 Patent through use of the word \"comprising\"."], ["[438]", "Third, and most importantly, the second infringement analysis is totally discredited because of the absence of \"slots\" (as the term is understood in the '505 Patent). Even if I were to consider the NIR ring to be a tubular member and to consider that numerous tubular members can infringe the '505 Patent (and I do not), there are no \"slots\" in the NIR \"ring\"."], ["[439]", "Johnson & Johnson claims that all future stents (for example, Cordis, BX Velocity, AVE-S7, NIR) essentially copied the \"rings\" and connector structure of the '186 Patent. It is said that Johnson & Johnson initiated actions against Guidant and AVE for patent infringement of the '505 and '186 Patents. Guidant \"settled\" by taking a licence under these patents. Medtronic (which acquired AVE) did the same. Johnson & Johnson submits that such licences constitute evidence that these future stents have the same structure as the Palmaz-Schatz stent."], ["[440]", "There are no licences in evidence. Nor is there evidence as to the terms of the licences. Aside from fleeting references, there is no specificity whatsoever in this regard. Consequently, I accord very little (if any) consideration to these submissions."], ["[441]", "There is evidence that Johnson & Johnson, at one point, put together a proposal for acquiring the NIR design (Project Olive). At the time, Johnson & Johnson indicated that \"the NIR is a superior stent design for both coronary and peripheral applications and has the potential to substantially replace the Palmaz and Palmaz-Schatz stents due to certain unique features\". I take this statement to be indicative of the superiority of (and distinction between) the NIR stent and the Palmaz stent."], ["[442]", "To return to \"nomenclature\", the absence of \"slots\" in the NIR stent signifies that it is of no moment whether the NIR is \"connected, zig-zag rings\" or \"integrated cells\". The rings can be there and can be rigid. Indeed, most of the flexibility can come from the U loops. Notwithstanding, the NIR stent does not infringe the Palmaz stent."], ["[443]", "Johnson & Johnson's infringement theories appear to me to treat any stent that has an expandable zig-zag ring as infringing, irrespective of what the rest of the structure and its openings look like, and regardless of how they function. This approach stretches the '505 Patent to cover devices that Dr. Palmaz neither described, nor invented. The fact that the NIR stent performs essentially the same ultimate function as the Palmaz stent does not render it an infringement of the '505 Patent. The NIR stent (no longer marketed) was a new method by which to reach a similar result. As Mr. Justice Binnie stated in", "Free World Trust", ", \"[t]he ingenuity of the patent lies not in the identification of a desirable result, but in teaching one particular means to achieve it. The claims cannot be stretched to allow the patentee to monopolize anything that achieves the desirable result\"."], ["[444]", "As stated earlier, because the '186 Patent is invalid, I need not address the issue of infringement in relation to it. However, even if I had determined that the '186 Patent was not obvious, since I reject Dr. Buller's building block Palmaz ring theory, and since the term \"slots\" in the '505 Patent means complete slots, the NIR stent could not infringe the '186 Patent in any event.", "Conclusion"], ["[445]", "The plaintiffs' claim of infringement will be dismissed. The defendant's counterclaim of invalidity with respect to the '505 Patent will be dismissed. The defendant's counterclaim of invalidity with respect to the '186 Patent will be allowed. Judgment will go accordingly."], ["[446]", "This is sufficient to dispose of the matter. Since the plaintiffs' infringement action is to be dismissed, the issues of remedies, ownership and licence do not arise."], ["[447]", "With respect to costs, I encourage counsel to endeavour to resolve the issue of costs by agreement. Success has been somewhat divided. Absent resolution, counsel are to serve and file written submissions (not to exceed five pages, double-spaced) within 35 days of the date of judgment. Responses to those submissions (not to exceed three pages, double-spaced) are to be served and filed within 10 days of service of the first submissions or within 45 days of the date of judgment, at the election of counsel.

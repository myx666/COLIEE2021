At the time, she was 20 years old and pursued studies in English and fashion design. On March 12, 2006, Ms. Li married Adam Ryan, a Canadian citizen. The marriage was arranged by two individuals Ms. Li had become acquainted with at a cost to Ms. Li of $30,000."], ["[4]", "Mr. Ryan received a fee for the marriage and for sponsoring Ms. Li's application for permanent residency. Ms. Li's application for permanent residency was subsequently assessed without incident and she obtained permanent resident status on March 28, 2007. Ms. Li and Mr. Ryan never cohabited. They were divorced in October 2009 with the assistance of the individuals that had been paid to arrange the marriage."], ["[5]", "As part of a Canadian Border Services Agency [CBSA] investigation into a number of suspected \"marriages of convenience\" a report under subsection 44(1) of the IRPA was made on December 9, 2010 alleging that Ms. Li had filed a sponsored application for permanent residence on the basis of a paid marriage of convenience and was therefore inadmissible for misrepresentation. Three notices to appear for an interview were sent to Ms. Li. She failed to appear without explanation at the first two scheduled interviews and requested a postponement, through counsel, of the third interview. The request for postponement was refused and Ms. Li again failed to appear, advising that she was ill. Ms. Li was not called for another interview but was given 15 days to provide written submissions."], ["[6]", "In early November 2011, subsequent to receiving the notice to provide written submissions, Ms. Li and Mr. Ryan both provided statutory declarations attesting to the genuine nature of their marriage. On November 29, 2011, Mr. Ryan admitted his role in a paid marriage of convenience with Ms. Li to the CBSA. As a result a referral was made under subsection 44(2) of IRPA for an admissibility hearing before the Immigration Division."], ["[7]", "At the admissibility hearing on November 20, 2012, Ms. Li conceded for the first time that her sponsored application for permanent residence was based on a paid marriage of convenience with Mr. Ryan and that she had never lived with him. The Immigration Division therefore declared her inadmissible to Canada for misrepresentation under paragraph 40(1)(a) of IRPA, and issued a removal order."], ["[8]", "On appeal of her removal order to the IAD, Ms. Li did not contest the legal validity of the order but asked that the IAD exercise its equitable discretion and allow her appeal on H&C grounds. In support of her request for special relief she placed evidence before the IAD that she is recently married, is currently employed in her husband's business, is active in her community, involved in charitable activities and that removal to China would create a hardship."], ["[9]", "On the question of hardship, her evidence was to the effect that she has not lived in China for over nine years and she has no connections in China (she is an only child, her father has passed away and her mother now resides in Korea). Her current husband also testified to the hardship separation would generate, but acknowledged he had the resources to visit and support Ms. Li in China, and that he would do so if she were removed.", "II.", "IAD Decision"], ["[10]", "The IAD identified the factors to be considered in the assessment of special relief under paragraph 67(1)(c) of IRPA, citing the Federal Court's decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] FCJ No 1309: (1) seriousness of the misrepresentation, (2) expressions of remorse, (3) the length of time spent in Canada and establishment, (4) family relationships in Canada and the impact of the applicant's removal on them, (5) the degree of hardship that would be caused by the removal, (6) the best interests of a child affected by the decision, and (7) any other exceptional circumstances."], ["[11]", "The IAD addressed each of the factors, finding that the misrepresentations were material, multiple, advertent and deliberate, characterizing them as \"very serious\". The IAD emphasized that the applicant had knowingly engaged in a scheme to obtain permanent residency by fraud for selfish motives, that this type of scheme strikes at the integrity of the Canadian immigration system, and that persons admitted to Canada in this manner can perpetuate the fraud by sponsoring further foreign nationals. The IAD did not accept that she was a victim of deceit, and found that she had entered the marriage of convenience knowingly."], ["[12]", "In considering the question of remorse, the IAD recognized that the applicant had expressed some remorse but found these expressions to be largely self-serving as the applicant had ignored the notices for an interview and continued to deny the allegations against her until Mr. Ryan's admission forced her to concede."], ["[13]", "In considering the degree to which Ms. Li is established in Canada, the IAD recognized that she had lived in the country for ten years, was employed, and that she was involved in her community. The IAD concluded that this constituted a positive consideration. Similarly, the IAD noted that Ms. Li does not have family in China, and that she would face some hardship from being separated from her husband, but that her husband was in a position to visit her in China. The IAD stated that the hardship identified is a natural consequence of removal not rising to the level of meriting special relief. There were no children whose interests the IAD was required to consider."], ["[14]", "The IAD held that the positive factors were insufficient to warrant special relief in light of the seriousness of the misrepresentation at issue and therefore dismissed the appeal.", "III.", "Issues"], ["[15]", "The applicant raises the following issues in this application:", "A.

Ms. Li argues that stays are often granted in cases where a removal order is issued on the basis of criminality in order to give the person an opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation. The applicant submits that there was evidence of rehabilitation in her case that would strongly support granting a stay, and that she should have been offered the same consideration as criminals."], ["[17]", "The applicant further submits that it is not enough to consider the humanitarian considerations required to allow an appeal of a removal order. The applicant notes that although the factors to be considered are the same, the threshold of humanitarian considerations required to grant a stay is lower than those required to completely quash a removal order. The applicant argues that the IAD fettered its discretion by failing to consider a remedy within its jurisdiction."], ["[18]", "With respect to the evidence of the seriousness of the misrepresentation, the applicant submits that the court erroneously focused on the potential consequences of her conduct, that is, that persons who obtain status in this manner can perpetuate the process by sponsoring others, such that even more people can access publically funded services and benefits intended for permanent residents on the basis of that misrepresentation. The applicant argues that she has never used her status to sponsor others in this manner and, as a result, the IAD assessed the seriousness of her misrepresentation in a 'factual vacuum', based on speculation rather than the actual evidence.", "V.", "Respondent's Submissions"], ["[19]", "The respondent argues that the applicant never actually requested a stay; rather the Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] only shows that the applicant requested that the IAD grant the appeal.

The respondent argues that the IAD's conclusions with respect to the seriousness of the misrepresentation and other factors were supported by the evidence. The evidence demonstrated that the misrepresentation at issue went to the integrity of the immigration system, had caused an error in the administration of IRPA, that the applicant showed little real remorse and had only confessed when faced with no alternative.

In cases of criminality the IAD may exercise the H&C discretion provided for in subsection 68(1) of IRPA to stay a removal order and allow the individual to demonstrate they are unlikely to reoffend. This consideration does not normally arise in misrepresentation cases where there is no incentive to reoffend so long as one is allowed to remain in Canada.

The applicant's response was that \"we are only appealing on the Board's equitable jurisdiction under 68\". This statement is at odds with the position advanced at other points in the hearing where the applicant advocates for the appeal to be allowed on equitable or discretionary grounds, i.e. the special relief contemplated in para 67(1)(c) of the IRPA, not special relief in the form of a stay under s. 68. With the exception of this early reference to section 68 of IRPA at no time does the applicant expressly request a stay as either the primary or alternative remedy.

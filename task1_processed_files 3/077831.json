Analysis And Decision"], ["[18]", "At the outset, counsel for the respondent noted, as the Board had done in its decision, that the existence of the presumption under s. 21(9) did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the applicant's disabling condition was the result of his military service. In this regard, he directed my attention to the distinction between the right to a pension as a result of military service in time of war and the right to a pension as a result of military service in peace time. In the first case, a pension is granted for invalidity caused by \"an injury or disease or an aggravation thereof that was attributable to or was", "incurred during such military service", "\", [See footnote 9] while in the second, the cause of the invalidity must be one that \"arose out of or was directly connected with such military service\". [See footnote 10]"], ["[19]", "Thus a war pensioner is entitled to a pension for any invalidity incurred during military service, irrespective of its origin, while a peace-time pensioner must establish a causal relationship between his invalidity and the military service. In this regard, the presumption enjoyed by the applicant establishes that his condition did not exist prior to his military service. The evidence discloses, moreover, that this condition existed when he left the military service. It must thereby be concluded that his condition was incurred during his military service. But the presumption is silent concerning the cause of his condition, which leaves the onus on the applicant to establish a direct relationship between the cause of his condition and his military service. This is what the Appeal Board attempted to explain in the course of its decision, when it stated:", "[Translation] \"To be eligible for a pension under subs. 21(2) of the", "Pension Act", ", the applicant must establish that his work in the military service or his military duties contributed in some way to the appearance or aggravation of his disabling condition. In no circumstances does the presumption concerning medical condition in subs. 21(9) entitle one to what is called the 'insurance principle' provided for veterans in peace time under subs. 21(1) of the", "Pension Act", ".\" [See footnote 11]"], ["[20]", "This is also what the Court of Appeal obviously decided to clarify when it amended the initial order it rendered in this case. As we could see, its initial decision could have been interpreted as giving some effect to the presumption concerning the cause of the disability, while the amended version eliminates any ambiguity about the fact that the presumption has a strictly temporal effect, as s. 21(9) contemplates."], ["[21]", "Over and above the fact that the Board was required to presume that the applicant's condition was incurred during his military service, he still had to demonstrate the cause of that condition. More specifically, he had to show that his condition, or its aggravation, \"arose out of\" or \"was directly connected with\" his military service. The Board found that the applicant's condition was not the result of his military service but that the military service had contributed by 20 percent to its aggravation, thus confirming the previous decision."], ["[22]", "In light of this short discussion, it is clear that from a statutory standpoint, the Board was entitled to find that military service was not the cause of the applicant's disability, notwithstanding the presumption of good health in his favour. It is equally clear that this conclusion did not prevent the Board from also finding that the applicant's condition had been aggravated by his military service and that, in the circumstances, s. 21(2.1) was applicable."], ["[23]", "The only remaining question is therefore whether the Board could, reasonably and without acting in a perverse manner, conclude as it did based on the evidence that was before it, when this evidence is considered in light of the statutory presumptions in the applicant's favour."], ["[24]", "There are three such presumptions. The first is the one we have already discussed, which provides that the applicant was deemed to be in good health at the time he enlisted. [See footnote 12] The second is the one in s. 21(3) of the", "Act", "which, for the purpose of determining whether a disability or aggravation thereof is directly connected with or arose out of military service, presumes this to be the case if the individual, in the course of his duties, was exposed to an environmental hazard that might reasonably have caused the disease or injury or the aggravation thereof. The third is the one in s. 108 of the", "Act", "and s. 10(5) of the", "Veterans Appeal Board Act", ", which provide that in matters involving the awarding of a military pension:", "1. every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant shall be drawn;", "2. any uncontradicted evidence presented by the applicant shall be accepted, provided that it is credible; and", "3. any doubt as to whether the applicant has established a case shall be resolved in favour of the applicant."], ["[25]", "Concerning the evidence as such, the Board had before it the opinion of Dr. Langis, issued October 28, 1986, which is the basis of the partial award of pension that was granted by the Board of Review on May 15, 1987. It states:", "[Translation] \"Having reviewed your military medical file, there is no doubt in my mind that all the difficulties in your left ear began in the R.C.A.F. in the course of your training, in inclement climatic conditions.\" [See footnote 13]"], ["[26]", "The Board also had before it a medical guideline of the Canadian Pension Commission concerning conductive hearing loss and otitis media. The following extracts were noted by the Board in the course of its decision:", "Conductive Hearing Loss", "\"Blast injury and barotrauma have already been mentioned as possible causes of conductive hearing loss. Among the more common causes are otitis externa, otitis media, and otosclerosis.", "\"Otitis externa is an inflammation of the skin of the external ear canal. Swelling, or collection of discharge in the canal, or both may cause a conductive hearing loss. It is temporary - with one exception. A form of malignant otitis externa occurs in elderly diabetics. It is resistant to treatment, and could cause a permanent conductive hearing loss.", "\"Otitis media is inflammation of the middle ear caused by infection, and may be acute or chronic.", "\"In acute otitis media, the main complaint is pain. Pus accumulates in the middle ear (hence the name acute suppurative otitis media) and bulges the eardrum. The eardrum may rupture, pus will be discharged, and the pain will stop at once. A conductive hearing loss is present from the onset. With proper treatment the infection clears, the perforated eardrum usually heals leaving a small scar, and the hearing returns completely to normal.", "\"With or without treatment, the perforation may persist. The hearing may or may not be normal, depending on the size and situation of the perforation. The ear is prone to recurrent infections and purulent discharge. The otitis media has become chronic. This type of chronic otitis media is seldom, if ever, a threat to life, and can often be treated successfully by surgery (tympanoplasty).", "\"A more dangerous type is chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. This does not begin with acute otitis media, but is chronic from the start. (Some authorities believe it may occur as a result of repeated attacks of acute otitis media in childhood which were unrecognized, untreated, or inadequately treated. Some have even postulated attacks of acute otitis media in utero.)", "\"Cholesteatoma is an ingrowth of squamous epithelium (skin) which expands like a tumor. If untreated, it may invade the mastoid bone, causing chronic mastoiditis; the facial canal, causing facial paralysis; and the labyrinth (inner ear) causing labyrinthitis, with vertigo and sensorineural hearing loss. These can lead to meningitis or brain abscess, and possibly death. This is the type of chronic otitis media that was at one time treated by radical mastoidectomy. The usual treatment now is a form of tympanoplasty. ...", "\"A nonsuppurative form of otitis media has been called catarrhal otitis media, serous otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and other names. In this variety, the midddle ear contains serous or mucoid fluid, and there is a conductive hearing loss that can be reversed by treatment. If untreated, the condition may progress to chronic adhesive otitis media - in effect, scarring of the middle ear - with a permanent conductive hearing loss.", "\"A history of earache prior to enlistment or even a history of previous discharge from the ear is not evidence of previous otitis media. There are many causes of both symptoms. An earache may even be caused by a condition unconnected with the ear - referred pain from a tooth, for example. Real evidence of a pre-enlistment otitis media would be such facts as: a documented history; a conductive hearing loss detected at enlistment by the methods of testing then in use (conversation or whispered voice tests, audiometry); a scarred, fixed, or perforated eardrum (proof of previous middle ear disease); and the scar of a previous mastoidectomy.", "\"Otitis media can be related to Regular Force service in only one uncommon circumstance: rupture of the eardrum from blast or injury, with subsequent infection of the middle ear. ...\" [See footnote 14]"], ["[27]", "Relying primarily on the final paragraph of this guideline, and pointing out that Dr. Langis had not explained how a bacterial infection of the middle ear might have been caused by bad weather, the Board concluded that:", "[Translation] \"From the medical standpoint, there is no ground for saying that a bacterial infection of the ear might have resulted from exposure to bad weather.\" [See footnote 15]", "With those words the Appeal Board disposed of Dr. Langis's opinion."], ["[28]", "Given the presumption of good health, the Board should have assumed that the applicant's eardrum was intact at the time of his enlistment, which rules out the possibility that it was scarred, fixed or perforated or that the applicant was suffering from some middle ear ailment at the time of his enlistment."], ["[29]", "Furthermore, the Board, while assigning little significance to it, accepted the fact that the applicant had been exposed to inclement weather or, as they put it, \"bad weather\", during his training period. Through the initial presumption under s. 21(3), the Appeal Board should therefore have presumed the existence of a causal relationship between the applicant's ailment or its aggravation and the climatic conditions to which he was exposed."], ["[30]", "The evidence as accepted by the Appeal Board discloses that the initial indications of the ailment were manifested on March 22, 1954, almost four months after the commencement of military service. The applicant was then complaining of hearing loss. Since the disabling condition did not appear to dissipate he was hospitalized in April 1954. A development culture of the pus that was accumulating in his left ear confirmed the presence of staphylococci. The Board unequivocally recognized that the applicant was then suffering from an otitis media in the left ear."], ["[31]", "As for the remainder of the evidence, I am unable to overlook the fact that the Board could not refrain from drawing attention to some factors which would suggest that the applicant's condition existed at the time of enlistment. I have in mind in particular the extract from the examination of October 9, 1974, which the Board chose to cite, as well as the statements by the physicians who examined the applicant in 1956 and who spoke, as the Board notes, of a [Translation] \"former\" otitis. [See footnote 16] Needless to say, the Board had to disregard its apparent convictions concerning the applicant's medical condition and accept, for the purposes of its decision, that the applicant's condition had developed following his enlistment and not before."], ["[32]", "Thus, upon his arrival in the Armed Forces, the applicant is presumed to have been in good health, which means he was not suffering any illness. A few months later, he was suffering from an otitis media in the left ear. The cause of this illness or condition, in temporal terms, should therefore be situated between the time of his enlistment in December 1953 and the time his condition was first manifested, in March 1954."], ["[33]", "Moreover, the evidence discloses that during this time the applicant underwent his training and was exposed to the elements. I note that this was the wintertime. The Appeal Board therefore had to presume a causal relationship between the bad weather to which the applicant was exposed during his training and the otitis media, the first indications of which were manifested during this period, insofar as the bad weather might reasonably be the cause of this condition. In this regard Dr. Langis, an ear, nose and throat specialist, had stated that he entertained [Translation] \"no doubt\" about the existence of such a relationship."], ["[34]", "Despite this, the Board persisted in seeing no relationship between the cause of the applicant's condition and his training period. Relying strictly on the medical guideline, which states that otitis media is related to military activities only if there is a \"rupture of the eardrum from blast\", and on the fact that the applicant had not been exposed to blasts, it concluded that the cause could not be related to his training period."], ["[35]", "However, since the existence of the applicant's ailment as of April or March 1954 is established, and since according to the presumption of good health the causal factor must be located between that time and the time of his enlistment, what else could explain the occurrence of his condition other than the bad weather to which he was exposed during his training? I note in this regard that according to the evidence the applicant was not exposed to any other possible cause. [See footnote 17] This evidence concerning the existence of a single identifiable cause is both uncontradicted and credible. It follows that under the presumption in s. 10(5) of the", "Veterans Appeal Board Act", ", the Board was bound to take this as proved. The evidence before the Board indicated only one cause, therefore, for the applicant's condition: the inclement winter weather to which the applicant had been exposed during his training."], ["[36]", "Bearing in mind that the Board was further bound to draw from the evidence every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant and to resolve any doubt in his favour, the Board could not reasonably reach the conclusion it did. In my view, the decision it reached can only be explained on the basis of an unacknowledged refusal by the Board to agree to act on the presumption that the applicant was in good health at the time of his enlistment."], ["[37]", "The medical guideline on which the Board relied sets out some rules of general application that cannot be applied blindly and irrespective of the evidence. Clearly, the author of the guideline did not have in mind a situation in which any cause of otitis is excluded other than that related to the environment and bad weather during the winter. Dr. Langis, on the other hand, had that precise situation in mind and it is in that context that he concluded \"that there is no doubt... that all the difficulties in your left ear began in the R.C.A.F. in the course of your training, in inclement climatic conditions.\" [See footnote 18] In its decision the Board criticizes Dr. Langis for not explaining how a bacterial infection of the ear might have been caused by bad weather. The criticism is superfluous since, according to the hypothesis Dr. Langis was working on for the purposes of his opinion, the applicant's condition could not be explained otherwise. [See footnote 19]"], ["[38]", "I conclude, therefore, that the Appeal Board could not reasonably find that the cause of the applicant's otitis media, as opposed to its aggravation, did not arise out of or was not directly connected with his military service. The matter is therefore referred back to the Board for a decision on the pension to which the applicant is entitled, on the assumption that this causal relationship has been established."], ["[39]", "The applicant's counsel asked that the respondent be ordered to pay his costs on the ground that the Board intentionally breached his client's rights and, in particular, thwarted the Court of Appeal decision. I must note that the Board conducted itself in a stubborn fashion and was incapable of disregarding its convictions concerning the origin of the applicant's condition. But I am nevertheless not prepared to attribute bad faith to it. I therefore refuse to award costs in the circumstances."], ["[40]", "However, I note that in the normal course of things the applicant would be entitled to his full pension only three years after the date on which his entitlement is confirmed. The Board may, however, if it is of the opinion that a pension should be granted effective some previous date, grant additional compensation. In the circumstances of this case, and in particular having regard for the decision of December 10, 1993 which clearly unnecessarily delayed the applicant's right to his full pension, I venture to hope (while recognizing that the decision is the Board's to make) that the Board will elect to exercise its discretion in favour of the applicant and grant him some additional compensation.", "Application allowed.", "Editor: Angela E.

That subsection does not explicitly refer to a certificate issued by the Secretariat. It therefore comes as no surprise that, more than 10 years after the applicant's adoption, the Secretariat did not act on the citizenship officer's request for an opinion on the applicant's adoption, particularly since the Court of Quebec recognized the foreign judgement in 2002."], ["[66]", "In light of the particular circumstances of this case, there was no need to produce a certificate, issued by the Secretariat, confirming that the adoption complied with Quebec law. The lack of a certificate is merely a pretext for not approving the citizenship application."], ["[67]", "The citizenship officer also found that the applicant's adoption was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege in relation to immigration or citizenship because the adoptive father applied for the adoption upon the request of the child and his mother. This too is a mere pretext. Once again, it is clear that the citizenship officer failed to consider all of the evidence on record in the light of the relevant factors."], ["[68]", "According to the evidence on record, the adoption was in the best interests of the child and created a genuine parent-child emotional bond between the adopter and the adoptee. There is a considerable body of evidence against the suggestion that this could be an adoption of convenience, including the fact that the adoptive father and the applicant have maintained ties over the years since their arrival in Canada and since the applicant was granted permanent resident status in 2004."], ["[69]", "A noteworthy fact that emerges when we look at the circumstances surrounding the adoption is that the applicant's biological father had died. The applicant's adoptive father was himself an orphan, which may explain why he agreed to adopt the applicant at the request of the applicant's biological mother, who was in desperate need of assistance. Moreover, the neighbourhood children were giving the applicant a very hard time. The adoptive father had spent several months in Haiti personally looking after the applicant and his brother while their mother worked. He gave French classes and served as tutor."], ["[70]", "The adoptive father remained with the applicant in Haiti for a year before beginning the process to return to Canada. After their arrival in Quebec, he continued to act as a true father to the applicant, who enrolled in school and became part of the adoptive father's family. For many years, the applicant continued living with his adoptive father, who says he did everything to give him a better life and keep him safe. Today, the emotional bonds between the applicant and his adoptive father are still very strong. In every respect, the parental authority of the biological parents was transferred to the adoptive father."], ["[71]", "In the present case, the evidence on record does not admit the conclusion that the adoption was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege in respect of immigration or citizenship. In terms of acquiring citizenship, the more favourable regime introduced by section 5.1 of the Act for minor children adopted abroad did not exist in 2001. The immigration file was destroyed, but we do know that the applicant had to wait until 2004 to acquire permanent resident status."], ["[72]", "The impugned decision is unreasonable in every respect. The citizenship officer does not have the discretion to act for an oblique motive or to not approve a citizenship application that otherwise meets the conditions of section 5.1 of the Act."], ["[73]", "For all of these reasons, this application will be allowed. The decision of the citizenship officer will be set aside. A redetermination of the citizenship application under section 5.1 of the Act will be made on the basis of the evidence in the record, the applicable law and the reasons for judgment of this Court."], ["[74]", "Given the outcome, the applicant is entitled to costs.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[75]", "THE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that", "1. The application for judicial review is allowed;", "2. The citizenship officer's decision is set aside;", "3. A redetermination of the citizenship application under section 5.1 of the Act shall be made on the basis of the evidence in the record, the applicable law and the reasons for judgment of this Court; and", "4. Costs are awarded to the applicant.", "Application allowed.", "Editor: Gary W. McLaughlin/vnh"]]}

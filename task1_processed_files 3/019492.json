In other words there were serious performance issues brought to his attention.", "Subsequently, Sprint acquired a large contract with the government (the \"HRDC project\"). Mr. Lancaster was assigned to the HRDC project and ceased to perform any duties as a NDC. Rather, his role on the project was the installation of the lab equipment. This project was the only project to which Mr. Lancaster was assigned. His performance as an installer was fine. At the time of his termination, the HRDC project was nearing an end. There was no further requirement for hardware installation and no further need for an installer. No one has taken over his role on this project.", "While Mr. Lancaster worked full-time as an installer on the HRDC project, Sprint recognized that it required another NDC to assist with an increasing volume of work. Although aware of this need at Sprint and knowing that his work on the HRDC would be winding down, Mr. Lancaster did not inquire about the opportunity to perform any NDC work or make himself available to assist with the increased work load. Mr. Lancaster continued to work only as an installer on the HRDC project. In November, Sprint hired an employee to assist with network design duties.

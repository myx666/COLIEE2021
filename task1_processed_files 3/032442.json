This report appears to link the CLA to the August 2, 1999 attack, and refers to Mishake Muyongo only as a supporter of the CLA but as a leader of the Caprivi Freedom Movement. The ID found, however, that the group led by Mr. Muyongo was the one responsible for the attack. The ID noted that this conclusion was supported by the bulk of the evidence, while only a single report indicated otherwise.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "Accordingly, the ID concluded that Mr. Tjiueza was a member of an organization led by Mr. Muyongo, and that this organization committed an armed attack on August 2, 1999 against the Namibian government in an attempt to subvert it and secure political independence for the Caprivi region. Even though Mr. Tjiueza was not personally involved in the attack, he was a member of the organization that committed the attack.

Indeed, the Amnesty International report distinguishes between the CLA and the CLM, and states that Mr. Muyongo was a leader of both groups. Thus the report expressly shows there were several groups seeking Caprivi independence. In light of this evidence, the applicant alleges that it was unreasonable for the ID to conclude that Mr. Muyongo only led one group and that the CLM and CLA were the same. Since these organizations are different, it was unreasonable to find that the CLM was involved in the attack, as all of the documentary evidence points to either the CLA or the CLF as being responsible for the attack.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "I can find no reviewable error in the findings of fact reached by the ID.

It merely concluded that there was only one group led by Mr. Muyongo, and that its name was reported differently in different sources. Having read the evidence that the ID relied on, I believe this conclusion was reasonably open to it. There was no evidence that the CLM was not responsible for the August 1999 attack. Mr. Tjiueza did not claim that the CLM was a separate non-violent faction led by Mr. Muyongo. Given Mr. Tjiueza's evidence of the leadership and activities of the CLM, the ID's decision is reasonable and does not warrant intervention by this Court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "Furthermore, the ID did expressly consider the Amnesty International report, which suggested that Mr. Muyongo did not lead the group responsible for the attack. The ID weighed this report against other evidence that suggested Mr. Muyongo did lead the group responsible for the attack, and found the latter evidence more credible.

It provides that there is no temporal component to a finding of inadmissibility under those provisions, and that mere membership is enough to cause a foreign national to be inadmissible.

While the ID made no explicit finding on this point, it did quote the applicant's membership card as saying he was a member \"since 1998\". This implies that the ID considered his membership to continue after 1998. As well, as mentioned in the facts above, there was evidence that he became a member in late 1999 or 2000.

The applicant counters that the relief provided under s. 34(2) extends only to the removal of the inadmissibility, and not to the provision of the other rights guaranteed under the", "Convention relating to the Status of Refugees", ". In other words, if the applicant were to make a Pre-Removal Risk Assesment (\"PRRA\") application, and if he were to be found at risk, the non-refoulement protection granted to those found inadmissible under s. 34(1)(f) would not be sufficient to comply with Canada's obligations under the Refugee Convention, because he would not be given the right to work and the right to an education. This argument is misplaced and premature.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[39]", "Mr. Tjiueza has not applied to the Minister for relief from the s. 34(1)(f) inadmissibility finding under s. 34(2) of the Act.

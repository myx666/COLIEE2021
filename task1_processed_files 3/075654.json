Fjoser's evidence was that he arrived at this conclusion based on a review of media reports."], ["[11]", "There are a number of difficulties with Fjoser's evidence on the subject of what led to the initiation of the RFIs.

It is uncontested that Fjoser decided to issue the RFIs and to engage in the impugned actions.

One of those limits must be where there is a specific delegation framework where specific powers are given to specific positions and the same power is withheld from other positions.

I accept Inspector Ryan's disavowal of the premise and there is virtually no convincing evidence of that state of affairs. In my view, the analysis of a legitimate inquiry starts and stops at SEP.

Approximately nine months passed from the signing of the RFIs to their service. The sole explanation for this delay is the time necessary to coordinate matters with police so that there was police presence at the time the RFIs were served. That in itself is a remarkably long time to organize police assistance."], ["[80]", "While courts will not usually question the method of service of RFIs, in this case it is necessary to subject the method of service to some scrutiny.

The Visa Officer refused the application because, according to his affidavit, he was not satisfied that the Applicant had demonstrated that he would fact be entering Canada for a temporary purpose. A factor that weighed heavily with the Visa Officer was a lack of evidence.

The first is whether this application for judicial review is moot, having regard to the fact that the reason for the Applicant's request for a temporary visa, that is in speed skating competition, no longer exists.

The question of mootness arises from a general policy that the Court should decline to decide cases involving abstract or hypothetical cases, as when the subject of the lis has disappeared. However, even if that is the case, the Court has a discretion to hear the case and in exercising that discretion, the Court should consider whether there remain a live controversy, the need for an adversarial relationship in Court, judicial economy and the possibility that a decision to hear the case might be viewed as an intrusion upon the role of the legislative branch."], ["[5]", "In the present case, the parties agree that the lis has disappeared since the event for which the Applicant sought temporary admission in to Canada has been overtaken by the passage of time.

While the status of the Applicant's mother in the United States of America is not a relevant consideration in relation to the Applicant's request for a visitor's visa to enter Canada, the same cannot be said of the Visa Officer's concern about the whereabouts of the Applicant's parents in Russia.

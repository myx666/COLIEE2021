In its decision rendered on April 25, 2007, the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) dismissed the claim for protection because it did not believe the Applicant was who she claimed to be nor did the Board find her story of abuse to be credible.

He took her to the Medical Clinic Balbuena for treatment and told the doctor that she had been beaten by criminals. Upon their return home, she informed him that she wanted to end the relationship, but he burned her ID documents and threatened her with more beatings to keep her with him.", "(c) Another incident occurred when a neighbour heard screams and called a social worker from the Integral Family Development Agency (DIF), who interviewed the Applicant and took her to the Public Ministry of the judicial police to file a complaint. One of the agents knew her common-law spouse and alerted him. She was escorted home by police and her common-law spouse beat her in front of them until she passed out. She also believes that he attempted to strangle her."], ["[4]", "In 2004, the Applicant fled Mexico City for Queretaro; however, her common-law spouse located her, took her back home and locked her in the house for a few days.

The Board noted that she testified she obtained her passport in Mexico on the strength of an expired electoral card, since her husband had burned all of her identification papers and cards. The Board found her explanation to be contrary to country documents on Mexico which indicate that a birth certificate is required to obtain a valid passport. Further, the Applicant admitted that she did have a birth certificate with her mother in Mexico, but had not sent for it because counsel had instructed her not to. The Board concluded that the passport, the only document adduced as to the Applicant's identity, was not genuine."], ["[7]", "With respect to her allegations of abuse, the Board found the following inconsistencies and contradictions in the Applicant's testimony:", "(1) The psychological report submitted as evidence explained that, as a result of the trauma caused by her abusive experience with her common-law spouse, \"she is quite adamant that she will not engage in any sexual activities\", however, shortly after her arrival in Canada on September 24, 2004, she entered into a common-law relationship with another man for approximately one year. The Board indicated that the Applicant was unable to provide an explanation for this inconsistency", "(2) The Applicant testified that she was severely beaten and had an arm placed in a cast, however, the medical certificate submitted as evidence indicated that she had suffered \"multiples in both arms\" and pelvis, but made no mention of either arm specifically needing to be placed in a cast. The Applicant was not able to provide an explanation for this discrepancy."], ["[8]", "The Board found that both inconsistencies taken together rendered her story of physical abuse not credible."], ["[9]", "With respect to state protection, the Applicant had not rebutted the presumption that state protection is available in Mexico. The Applicant's one attempt to file a complaint was not sufficient in light of the other avenues for protection available including the National Human Rights Commission, the National Institute for Women, SACTEL (a 24 hour confidential hotline service created for the citizens to make complaints about public servant misconduct), or the General Comptroller's Citizen Assistance directorate."], ["[10]", "In support of its finding, the Board cited documentary evidence indicating that the Mexican government is moving forward with police reform, and investigating possible misconduct by federal officers and government employees resulting in the issuance of warnings, reprimands, suspensions, and dismissals."], ["[11]", "The Board also indicated that there was strong evidence of the government's serious efforts at improving state protection for women. The government set up various initiatives aimed at tackling the problem of violence against women, including pursuing the adoption of new legislation on violence against women in 15 states and the implementation of programs in 16 states to combat such violence. Specifically, the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women reported that \"[t] he Government of Mexico has taken significant steps to prevent, punish, and eradicate violence against women with due diligence.\""], ["[12]", "Finally, on the issue of the IFA, the Board was of the view that the Applicant could move to other large cities, such as Guadalajara or Monterrey if she took reasonable precautions such as not revealing her new address to relatives and friends. The Board saw no serious possibility that the Applicant would be tracked down by her ex-common-law spouse despite his employment with the AFI. The Board evaluated the possibility that, as an AFI agent, he would be able to track down the Applicant using electronic means on the basis of the Applicant's voter registration card but concluded, based on the record, that on a balance of probabilities this would not occur.

The documentary evidence reveals that when applying for a passport abroad a birth certificate is required. However, there is no evidence on the record that indicates the process for obtaining a passport in Mexico has the same requirement. The decision to reject the passport establishing the Applicant's identity was therefore made on a misapprehension of the facts and without regard to the evidence. Consequently, the Board erred in finding that the Applicant had not established her identity."], ["[18]", "With respect to the first of the two contradictions in the Applicant's testimony, I find that the Board ignored the explanation offered by the Applicant. The Board referred to the psychologist's report which indicated that the Applicant did not want to engage in sexual activities because of her traumatic experiences with her common-law spouse in Mexico and contrasted this with the fact that she had been involved in a relationship with a man shortly after her arrival in Canada. When faced with this contradiction, the Applicant offered an explanation which I reproduce from the transcripts of the hearing:", "Member: I have one question, because there's something that bothers me.", "In reading Dr. Palowski's report, he said, on page 4, that you will not engage in any sexual activities.", "Claimant: At this moment.", "Member: So, what kind of relationship did you have with this man?", "Claimant: No, what I meant was, at that moment, now that I finish my relationship with this man, I will not engage in any sexual activity until I feel better, until I cure myself.", "Member: Thank you.", "(p. 282, Tribunal Record)"], ["[19]", "While this explanation was indeed offered at the hearing, in its reasons, the Board indicated that \"[s] he could not provide an explanation for the inconsistency between the statement in the psychological report and her common-law relationship with Mr. Ramirez.\" The Board erred by stating that no explanation was offered by the Applicant and by failing to address the sufficiency of the Applicant's explanation in its reasons. Its finding with respect to the inconsistency is therefore unreasonable."], ["[20]", "The second contradiction, noted by the Board involved the Applicant's statement that she needed a cast after being assaulted by her common-law spouse while in Mexico and a medical report of the incident which did mention that the Applicant had suffered \"multiples in both arms\" but did not refer to a cast being required. Again, the Board found that the Applicant had failed to explain the discrepancy. While no explanation was forthcoming, the Board did acknowledge that this particular contradiction, on its own, would not suffice to render the Applicant's story of alleged abuse unbelievable. However, the Board went on to indicate that when viewed together, the two contradictions justified its finding of non-credibility."], ["[21]", "In my view, the Board's finding of a second contradiction is also questionable in the circumstances. In any event, given my determination that the Board's finding with regard to the first inconsistency is unreasonable, and considering the Board's statement that it was the cumulative effect of the two contradictions that rendered the Applicant's story not credible, it is not possible to ascertain what effect the erroneous finding would have had on the Board's analysis and on its ultimate credibility finding. I therefore find that the Board's credibility finding was made in error and is reviewable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J.

The responsiveness of the police and justice sectors to gender-based violence remains inadequate overall and needs to be improved\"; (UN Rapporteur on violence against women);", "• Police corruption, inefficiency and lack of transparency continue to be major problems in the justice system and many police officers are involved in kidnapping and extortion;", "• While the federal government has made some efforts in corruption awareness and prevention, the same cannot be said for enforcement and prosecution;", "• Domestic violence is considered by many as a private matter; many believe that sexism and even violence against women are part of the social fabric and this mindset has led many men, including policemen, prosecutors, judges and others in positions of authority, to underestimate the problem of violence against women;", "• Women who are victims of domestic violence face numerous obstacles when they attempt to report it."], ["[25]", "The Board failed to explain its selective reliance on the documentary evidence.

The Court stated that individuals should not be forced to hide out in isolated areas of the country, but \"... neither is it enough for refugee claimants to say that they do not like the weather in a safe area, or that they have no friends or relatives there, or that they may not be able to find suitable work there ...\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 14)"], ["[29]", "The Applicant's evidence is that she did relocate to Queretaro in 2004, but was tracked down by her common-law spouse, a trained police interrogator, who assaulted the Applicant's mother, and forced her to disclose the Applicant's new location.

But the Board did qualify its finding by stating that an IFA existed for the Applicant in Mexico, provided she took reasonable precautions and not reveal her new location to relatives and friends. Not to be able to share your whereabouts with family or friends is tantamount to requiring the Applicant to go into hiding. It is also an implicit recognition that even in these large cities, the Applicant is not beyond her common-law spouse's reach. In these particular circumstances, this cannot constitute an IFA for the Applicant.

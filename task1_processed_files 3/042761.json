The officer noted, however, that there has been little change in respect of the applicant's job and income since his first application, besides the fact that the applicant has continued to work. The applicant's income for the years 2006 to 2010 was $2,880, $9,984, $13,770, $10,243 and $6,391 respectively.

Although the TSR does not prevent the applicant from leaving Canada voluntarily, the officer stated that she took the period of inability to leave Canada due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control into account. However, the officer found that the applicant's establishment is not a sufficient justification for an exemption, despite the fact that the applicant has been in Canada since 2006 and has made significant efforts to integrate into Canadian society."], ["[13]", "The officer considered the applicant's argument that it is likely that he will remain in Canada without status indefinitely because of the TSR.

The officer therefore reiterated that the second application made on humanitarian and compassionate grounds by the applicant was not equivalent to an appeal."], ["[17]", "The officer stated that the applicant submitted considerable evidence attesting to the fact that many crimes and rapes are still committed in the DRC and that the armed forces have been guilty of fundamental rights violations (torture, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests, etc.), in certain cases for political reasons. However, the officer argued that the applicant did not explain in his application how that situation affects him or how the filing of an application from abroad would cause him hardship."], ["[18]", "The officer noted that a TSR is a process associated with a generalized risk to the civilian population when a country is facing a catastrophic event and that the applicant can therefore continue to avail himself of the TSR by staying in Canada.

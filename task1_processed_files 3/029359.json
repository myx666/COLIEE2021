IP5 refers to subparagraph 72(1)(e)(ii) of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> as requiring \"all foreign nationals to be in possession of a valid passport in order to become permanent residents\". Section 72 of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> however merely sets out the requirements for in-Canada applications for permanent residences of members of a class, such as the spouse or common law partner in Canada class. Subparagraph 72(1)(e)(ii) simply states that such persons must \"... hold a document described in any of paragraphs 50(1)(a) to (h)\". IP5 clarifies that the rational for requiring a valid and subsisting passport is that it is \"a relatively good confirmation of identity\" as \"[m]ost countries carefully verify an applicant's identity before issuing a passport that grants a person the right to enter that country\" and \"[i]ssuing governments are often in a better position to verify identity documents than Canadian officers\"."], ["[7]", "In a letter dated November 3, 2003, the applicant was advised by a Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) Official that \"Seaman's Passports\" are not an acceptable identification for landing purposes and that he had to provide a photocopy of a \"valid and subsisting\" passport from Russia. The objection to Seaman's Passports does not appear to be a matter of law but rather a guideline which CIC has adopted as policy. The \"valid and subsisting\" requirement derives from the former legislation.

In their responses, CIC officials took the position that their correspondence to Mr. Andryanov should suffice as notice to the Russian consular officials. In the alternative, he was told that he must provide a letter from the Embassy indicating why a passport would not be issued. Mr. Andryanov explained to CIC that the Seaman's Passport was issued to him when he went abroad and was the only form of passport he had ever received.

It would seem that the way in which a document expires is a matter that falls squarely within the issuing Government's expertise to determine. In light of the fact that the applicant clearly explained that the document was issued for life, absent a conclusion on the part of CIC that either the document was fraudulent or that they did not believe the explanation of the applicant, it was not open to them to conclude that the document was not subsisting.

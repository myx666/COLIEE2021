The CS:BE forms were requested from the applicant as per standard procedure. The respondent explains that the only difference between a bioequivalence and a bioavailability assessment is that bioequivalence compares two situations, whereas bioavailability only examines one. In the end, however, both amount to the same exercise. Ms. Kimby Barton's explanation in her affidavit on this point are apposite (Respondent's Confidential Record, p 10, at paras 51-53):", "51. A CS:BE aids reviewers in their assessment of pivotal comparative bioavailability studies. A comparative bioavailability study is considered to be pivotal if the results from the study are used to support the safety and efficacy of the drug product.", "52. Since a completed CS:BE is a summary, it does not include any new information. It is, however, a useful tool. By summarizing information found in multiple documents, and directing reviewers to where documents can be found within the drug submission, a CS:BE helps reviewers provide consistent and timely evaluation.", "53. The CS:BE is not an official requirement. However, if a submission includes one or more pivotal comparative bioavailability study(ies), completed CS:BEs are usually included in the documents provided by the sponsor at the time of filing. If CS:BEs are not provided at the time of filing, it is standard practice for Health Canada to request that the sponsors complete a CS:BE for each pivotal comparative bioavailability study. This request is made proactively prior to the file being reviewed in detail, to avoid further delays in the review process should such a summary be of assistance."], ["[60]", "A further issue before the Court was whether the respondent took into account the applicant's CS:BE forms before issuing the NOD on May 31, 2010. On this issue, the Court agrees with the respondent to the effect that the new studies were deficient and did not demonstrate clinical relevance and, this fact alone was sufficient to dismiss the submission. Ms. Barton also explained in her affidavit that, in some cases, the CS:BE will not have any impact on the decision because of the significant deficiency (Respondent's Confidential Record, p 10, para 54):", "54. In some cases, however, a decision about a submission is made by a reviewer without having to refer to the CSBEs provided by the sponsor. In particular, if there is a significant enough deficiency in the submission, the review stops, and the CS:BEs provided by the sponsor may not be used."], ["[61]", "Therefore, in light of the above and considering the deficiencies identified with the data provided by the new studies (70294 and 70381), the Court is of the view that the respondent did not commit a reviewable error in rejecting the applicant's SNDS. The Court finds that the respondent's decision was a reasonable one."], ["[62]", "The Court now turns to the issue of procedural fairness.", "Issue 3: Did the Respondent Commit a Breach of Procedural Fairness?"], ["[63]", "The applicant maintains that the respondent breached its duty of fairness in the circumstances (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [", "Baker", "]. For the reasons that follow, the Court is of the view that there was no such breach committed by the respondent."], ["[64]", "The Court is of the view that that the decision-making process in the case at bar is more akin to an administrative process than a judicial process. Therefore, the degree of fairness owed in the present case is lower than the degree of fairness owed in the context of a judicial proceeding (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 435 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 577)."], ["[65]", "More particularly, the Court notes that the process in the circumstances is a flexible one. For instance, the fact that a sponsor may re-file following a negative decision and request a reconsideration is reflective of a process that is administrative. The applicant also acknowledges that there was no legal obligation on the part of the respondent to meet with the applicant and that an oral hearing was not required to be conducted (Transcript, p 38, lines 6-7 & 21-23)."], ["[66]", "The Court's review of the record and evidence leads it to conclude that an adequate review of the applicant's submission was conducted by the respondent. This review revealed several fatal deficiencies in the applicant's submission and it was thus reasonable for the respondent to bring its review of the submission to an end."], ["[67]", "The applicant nonetheless alleges that the respondent failed to conduct a comprehensive review. Yet, the evidence demonstrates that the issues raised by the applicant in its NOD-Response (June 18, 2010) were identified and addressed by the respondent (see Applicant's Confidential Record, Volume 2, Tab 14 (email dated December 15, 2010); Respondent's Confidential Record, Volume 2, Tab 22 (email dated December 17, 2011); Applicant's Confidential Record, Volume 2, Tab 17 (Notice of Deficiency - Withdrawal Letter (NOD-W dated January 21, 2011)). Hence, the Court cannot agree with the applicant that there was a failure to provide reasons. In fact, reasons were given in the NOD by the respondent and the applicant was given an opportunity to respond in writing. The applicant's response was considered and the respondent confirmed its original decision in the NOD-W."], ["[68]", "Also, the Court cannot agree with the applicant that the respondent added concerns in its NOD-W; rather, the NOD-W merely responded to each of the points made by the applicant in its NOD-Response and included the reviewer reports. Further, the Court observes that the respondent responded to the applicant's request and the applicant was provided with opportunities to communicate with the respondent - including a teleconference (Applicant's Confidential Record, Volume 1, Tab C (Affidavit of Michael Gallo), p 18, para 63; Applicant's Confidential Record, Volume 1, Tab 9, pp 226-227). In this case, the decision-making process has to be viewed in a", "continuum", "and, as it was unfolding, the respondent answered the applicant's concerns as and when they were expressed."], ["[69]", "The Court likewise rejects the argument that the process was not entirely transparent and points to the review conducted by Dr. Zoltan Gombos of BCANS (Applicant's Confidential Record, Volume 2, Tab 17, p 327). The research conducted by Dr. Gombos merely demonstrates that the respondent took an additional step and performed a literature and a web site search to verify whether there would be any mention of clinical relevance. Nothing of significance was found."], ["[70]", "Finally, there is the issue of the Reconsideration process. This mechanism was explicitly created to allow for reconsideration of a decision and provides a party with further opportunity to respond to concerns about the studies outlined in the NOD-W. While the applicant submitted a request for reconsideration it also concurrently filed an application for judicial review before the Court. In doing so, the applicant chose to terminate the Reconsideration process. Pursuant to the", "Guidance for Industry: Reconsideration of Final Decisions Issued for Human Drug Submissions", "\"[i]f, at any time during the Reconsideration process, the sponsor files a Notice of Application to the Federal Court to resolve the matter, the Directorate will terminate the Reconsideration process\" (Respondent's Confidential Record, Volume 2, Tab 24, pp 387 & 392)."], ["[71]", "The applicant emphasized that the Director General issued both the NOD and the NOD-W, which gave the applicant cause to doubt that there would be any meaningful review during the Reconsideration process given that it was also to be carried out by the Director General. Again, the Court cannot accept the applicant's argument in this regard as it was in no way precluded from raising this concern during the Reconsideration process."], ["[72]", "After reviewing the evidence and hearing the parties, the Court finds that the respondent's decision, when read as a whole and in its proper context, is reasonable and that the respondent did not commit a breach of procedural fairness (", "Baker", ", above;", "Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[73]", "The Court's intervention is accordingly not warranted. The application for judicial review will be dismissed.", "POSTCRIPT"], ["[74]", "These Reasons for Judgment are un-redacted from Confidential Reasons for Judgment which were issued on August 9, 2012 pursuant to the Court's Direction dated August 9, 2012.

Csaba Beri stated that he did not report a 2001 assault to the police because he did not know the names of his attackers and thought the police would not do anything about the incident. In May of 2008, Csaba Beri was again assaulted while looking for a job. He asked a security guard to help him but was told to go home. He did not report this to the police because he was afraid of them and did not believe they would assist him either. The RPD also noted that in July 2009, Csaba Beri was violently forced out of a café because he was a \"gypsy\". He did not report this incident to police as he feared the police and did not believe they would be of assistance, but thought that they would instead humiliate him.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The RPD also considered that the child, Csaba Martin Beri, was attacked by skinheads in the summer of 2009.

However, the evidence indicates that the Applicants made one police report and, in response to a follow up inquiry from the Applicants, the police advised that they were closing the case as they had not been able to identify the assailants. This does not support the RPD finding that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the police were not making genuine and earnest efforts to investigate the allegations and apprehend the perpetrators.

In addition, the country reports indicate that the IPCB's investigative rights are \"insufficient\" and are usually limited to the complaint and the file of the case as submitted by the police, making it difficult for the IPCB to reconstruct the facts (Hungarian Helsinki Committee (HHC). 21 September 2009.

Decision makers who derive their powers from statutes are entitled, in review of their decisions, to a measure of deference in most cases. How much deference is to be accorded may range from little deference where the standard is correctness to substantial deference where the standard accepts decisions unless they are patently unreasonable. At the correctness end, a reviewing Court can reverse a decision if it is found to be simply incorrect. At the other end of the spectrum the decision can only be set aside if the error made by the decision maker is so unreasonable that it is without any foundation in evidence or law. Between the extremes of the spectrum a standard of reasonableness may be appropriate where the decision under review does not concern only a question of law and it is sufficient if it be supported by reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing analysis. [see footnote 2] Essentially, there must be a foundation for the decision."], ["[7]", "The measure of deference in a given case is assessed by the \"pragmatic and functional\" approach recently restated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [see footnote 3] and followed in", "Baker", ".

The two cases are in substantial agreement, except for the question of the relative expertise of the decision maker. In her decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Madam Justice Reed wrote at paras 18-23:", "\"The factors relevant in determining the standard of review applicable in a judicial review proceeding were recently set out in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The overriding consideration is the intention of the legislature: did it intend that a reviewing court accord the decision under review deference, or was a full right of appeal intended, or does the relevant standard fall somewhere on the spectrum that lies between these two poles. Also, the standard of review must be determined by reference to the specific nature of the decision under review. The same standard will not necessarily apply to all decisions of the same decision-maker. The factors to be assessed according to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> are: (1) the legislative provisions governing the review process, including whether there is a privative clause; (2) the degree of expertise of the tribunal with respect to the question in issue, as compared to the degree of expertise the reviewing court has on that subject; (3) the purpose of the legislation and the nature of the decision-maker; that is, whether the decision-maker is balancing public policy considerations (sometimes vaguely worded) as opposed to adjudicating the rights of individuals; (4) the nature of the decision under review, including whether it is a question of law or a question of fact.", "\"I turn then to these factors as they relate to the decision under review. The legislative parameters of the intended review are set out in subsection 18.1(4) of the", "Federal Court Act", ". The Plan contains no privative clause except to say that decisions of the Pension Appeals Board are final, subject only to judicial review. While there has been some indication in the jurisprudence that paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the", "Federal Court Act", "requires \"patent unreasonability\", this was not the test applied in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , or more recently in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . I note that the phrases in paragraph 18.1(4)(d) are disjunctive; one asks whether the decision under review was based on a finding of fact that was made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before the decision-maker. That is, insofar as the review of decisions by reference to their underlying facts is concerned, the statutory mandate allows for a spectrum of review from one which involves a high degree of deference (perversity or capriciousness must be shown) to one in which correctness or reasonableness may be the test (the decision-maker did not exhibit regard for the material before it).

In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the application for leave raised new or additional evidence not considered by the Review Tribunal, and open for consideration in de novo proceedings before the Appeal Board.

The letter briefly advised that as of July 1, 1998 the applicant was awarded \"AISH disability\", and asked that this be considered when decisions are made in regard to his file. The decision to deny leave makes no reference to this information, and the applicant urges that the decision was in error in ignoring this. Particularly, it was urged when this application for judicial review was heard, that the error is obvious when the requirement of severe disability under the province of Alberta AISH program is said to be the same as that under the Canada Pension Plan. Indeed, Mr. Callihoo bases his application for judicial review upon the following grounds:", "\"1.

Without further evidence than the brief reference in the fax letter there is not, in my opinion, any significant additional evidence raised by the application for leave when it was considered by the designated PAB member. The further reference in the written grounds for this application for judicial review, and the applicant's comments when this matter was heard, were not \"evidence\" before the leave decision maker; and they do not provide \"evidence\" warranting the Court intervening to set aside the decision refusing leave."], ["[18]", "I have myself checked the", "Alberta Regulation 203/99, Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped", ", made pursuant to the Alberta statute with the same title.

The decision of the Review Tribunal, in the applicant's view, was based more on earlier rather than later medical reports, and questions of the Tribunal members about his physical activities failed to deal with matters that would support some of the conclusions of the Tribunal about the extent and continuity of his activities. In another context, the Tribunal assumed that certain light treatment for SAD would assist the applicant, but it had been tried before the Tribunal considered his case, and had not helped and was discontinued.", "3. Reviewing the facts of his case and some aspects of the Tribunal's report that are said to be in error, the applicant believes that he qualifies as disabled as that word is defined in the dictionary. When this application was heard, this concern was underlined by his subsequent qualification for benefits under the Alberta program for support of those who are disabled. The applicant expressed concerns about the definition of disabled relied upon by the tribunal."], ["[20]", "In review of these concerns in relation to the decision of the Tribunal, without considering the merits of the leave application except to assess whether it raises an arguable case, it is my opinion that:", "1. Even if one member of the Tribunal demonstrated little or no knowledge of one of the conditions claimed to affect the applicant, that in itself raises no grounds for finding bias or a lack of impartiality on the part of that one member or of the three person tribunal. There is no requirement that a member of the tribunal have knowledge of each of the many conditions that underlie a claim for disability benefits. A member's decision is not based on his or her own understanding of medical conditions, but upon his or her assessment of the reports of medical examiners, reports which are provided in the main by the applicant for benefits.", "2. The concern that insufficient attention was paid to the later and to certain medical reports is in essence a concern about the weight given by the Tribunal to particular aspects of the evidence before it. Insofar as the concern relates to particular factual references in the Tribunal's decision, in my opinion any such factual errors by the Tribunal are not basic to its ultimate decision, which is dependent upon the medical evidence in the record.", "3.

Counsel for the respondent, the Attorney General of Canada, urged that the decision, in particular the portion stating \"I see no error in principle on the part of the Tribunal. I do not see a proper foundation for granting leave to appeal\", makes clear that the designated member was properly considering whether the application for leave had raised an arguable case, without considering the merits of the application. That line may be difficult to draw in a given case, I acknowledge, but I am persuaded that in this case the leave application was assessed by the proper test, i.e., whether it raised an arguable case, without considering the merits of the application."], ["[22]", "In the absence of significant new or additional evidence not considered by the Review Tribunal, an application for leave may raise an arguable case where the leave decision maker finds the application raises a question of an error of law, measured by a standard of correctness, or an error of significant fact that is unreasonable or perverse in light of the evidence.

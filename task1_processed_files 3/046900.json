On December 16, 2002, he submitted an application to sponsor his wife's application for permanent residence. On March 23, 2003, a visa officer refused his wife's application for permanent residence on the basis that she was not a member of the family class.

There was, according to Mr. Dave, no such conscious decision because when he submitted his application for a permanent resident visa, he was not married. Thus, his wife could not have been included in the application. There was no reason, following his marriage, for him to have consciously excluded her from his application because the marriage is bona fide and disclosure of it would not have jeopardized his immigration to Canada. Further, urges Mr. Dave, the IAD interpreted the phrase \"at the time of that application\" too broadly. It should be interpreted to mean \"at the time the application was made\". Since he submitted his application for permanent residence in September, 1999 - well before he got married - he was no longer an applicant at the time of his marriage because his application had already been processed. Accordingly, his wife could not have been a non-accompanying family member \"at the time of the application\" and paragraph 117(9)(d) should not have been applied to exclude her from the family class.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "Mr. Dave's submission regarding the policy is flawed. The expressed intention underlying paragraph 117(9)(d) of the", "Regulations", "does not impose a duty on the IAD to consider, explicitly or otherwise, whether the exclusion of a family member from an application for permanent residence was the result of a \"conscious decision\". The policy addresses the exclusion of family members who were not examined because of a decision by CIC not to examine them. Here, Mr. Dave's wife was not examined because Mr. Dave failed to inform the Canadian authorities of the change in his marital status. Hence, the respondent was denied the opportunity of even considering whether to examine her. The impugned section was amended on August 11, 2004 (SOR/2004-167) and the amendments incorporate the concerns addressed in the policy.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "Moreover, in my view, Mr. Dave must be taken to have consciously excluded his wife from his application. Following submission of his application for permanent residence, he received correspondence from the Canadian High Commission. That correspondence contained the following direction:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Should your address, family configuration, or any other information change, please notify this office as quickly as possible. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The fact that he elected to rely on his consultant's comments - that it was not essential to advise the visa office or the visa officer about his marriage - rather than the written instructions of the Canadian High Commission indicates a deliberate choice on his part.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "Insofar as Mr. Dave's proposed interpretation of the phrase \"at the time of that application\" is concerned, he does not suggest that the words \"that application\" refer to anything other than an application for permanent residence. Nor does he dispute that a visa, in and of itself, does not confer a right of entry:", "Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), per  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). Although this jurisprudence was concerned with provisions under the former legislation and the term \"landing\" is no longer found in", "IRPA", ", the rationale contained in the noted authorities remains apposite. One does not become a permanent resident until one is \"landed\". Consequently, the application process is not complete merely as a result of the processing of an application for a visa or because a visa is granted. The \"time of that application\" includes the period that begins with the submission of the application and continues through to the time when permanent residence is granted. Were it otherwise, any applicant could circumvent the provisions of the legislation by simply completing and submitting his or her application form prior to marrying.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "In short, the application process for permanent residence encompasses not only the application for a visa, but also the application for admission at the port of entry (POE). Accordingly, the argument that the phrase \"at the time of that application\" comprises only the point in time when the application form was completed and submitted must fail.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "THE CHARTER  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "Mr. Dave initially challenged the application of paragraph 117(9)(d) of the", "Regulations", "under both ss. 7 and 12 of the", "Charter", ". He abandoned his argument regarding s. 12. In relation to s. 7, he submits that the refusal of his wife's application for permanent residence has deprived him of the company of his wife in Canada. This, according to Mr. Dave, constitutes a breach of his \"security of the person\". He has been exposed to serious psychological stress as a result of a state process. He maintains that he was not deprived of his s. 7 rights in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. He contends that paragraph 117(9)(d), when read together with the policy, is vague and uncertain in that it does not provide fair notice of what is prohibited and therefore leads to arbitrary enforcement. He claims that he was deprived of his right to a full and proper hearing by the IAD on the issue of whether he made a conscious decision to exclude his wife from his application for permanent residence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "Mr. Dave acknowledges that since leave was granted in relation to this application, Mr. Justice Kelen, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 341 (F.C.), determined that paragraph 117(9)(d) does not violate s. 7.

In view of my determination regarding Mr. Dave's \"conscious decision\" not to disclose the change in his marital status, I am not persuaded that the material facts in", "De Guzman", "are substantially different from those in this proceeding. The fact that", "De Guzman", "concerned an applicant and her children while this matter concerns an applicant and his wife is not a sufficient basis upon which to distinguish it. In my view, paragraphs 63 to 70 of", "De Guzman", "provide a complete response to Mr. Dave's s. 7", "Charter", "challenge.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "The crux of the noted paragraphs is that s. 7 is not engaged as a consequence of any action by the respondent. An applicant, as a potential immigrant, is subject to the requirements of the immigration law and regulations and has no other right to enter Canada. An applicant who chooses to ignore the law (by failing to disclose changed marital status) cannot submit that the law deprived (him) of the right to security of the person.

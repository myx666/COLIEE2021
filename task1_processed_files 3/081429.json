In determining whether or not the allegations are justified, the court must then decide whether, on the basis of such facts as have been assumed or proven, the allegations would give rise in law to the conclusion that the patent would not be infringed by the respondent. The court should start from the proposition that the allegations of fact in the notice of allegation are true except to the extent that the contrary has been shown by the applicant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 319).", "\"It is the applicant which, as the initiator of the proceeding, has the carriage of the matter and bears the initial burden of proof.

Since this is not an action for infringement the applicant may not claim the benefit of that presumption."], ["[12]", "It is important to note that when the Bayer patent here in issue was granted in 1987 the", "Patent Act", "provided, under s. 39(1) that", "\"39(1) In the case of inventions relating to substances prepared or produced by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine, the specification shall not include claims for the substance itself, except when prepared or produced by the methods or processes of manufacture particularly described and claimed or by their obvious chemical equivalents.\""], ["[13]", "With the revisions effective in 1993 (by the", "Patent Act Amendment Act, 1992", ", S.C. 1993, c. 2, s. 3) that provision was repealed.

Of those claims, claims 8 and 14 are claims to the product, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, when prepared, in the case of claim 8 \"by a process according to claim 1 or an obvious chemical equivalent thereof\", and in the case of claim 14 \"when prepared by a process according to claim 10, 11 or 12 or an obvious equivalent chemical thereof\".

Claim 10 appears as an independent claim though Apotex urges that since it relates to a process for preparing the starting compound for claim 1, any infringement of the 14 relevant claims must involve infringement of claim 1. Since Apotex claims that its process will not infringe claim 1 of the Bayer patent, it cannot be an infringement of any other relevant claim."], ["[17]", "That claim of Apotex is related to its comparison of the Bayer process and its own. In Apotex' view claim 1 of the Bayer patent is a process claim for the penultimate step in production of ciprofloxacin and since the comparable step in the Apotex process is different, with a different starting material and a different reagent the processes are not the same, nor are they obvious chemical equivalents."], ["[18]", "I am persuaded that description, comparing the two processes in their final stages, is only part of the appropriate comparison of the two processes. I come to that conclusion on the evidence of Doctors Corey and Wuest that the final stage of the Apotex process, simply removing an unnecessary protecting group on the piperazine group, a well known technique in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, does not reveal enough of the process for preparation of the Apotex product to justify the allegation it has made that it does not infringe the process patented by Bayer."], ["[19]", "On the basis of evidence of the Apotex process in full, tracing from earlier intermediates, which evidence was ordered to be produced for comparison with the process of Bayer as more fully set out in the patent claims than in claim 1 alone, there are three differences between the processes utilized by the parties upon which Apotex relies for its allegation that its process does not infringe any claim for the medicine itself. By the", "Regulations", "and by the product by process claims of the patent this must be taken as an allegation that Apotex will not infringe the claims for the medicine when prepared by the processes claimed in the Bayer patent or by obvious chemical equivalents of those processes."], ["[20]", "The first difference pointed to by Apotex is that its process starts with a β-diketone (compound VI) whereas the Bayer process uses a β-ketoester (compound IX) as starting materials. Those are otherwise described by counsel for Bayer as, in the case of Apotex, using an acetyl group, and, in the case of Bayer, an ethoxycarbonyl group, in each case at the three position of the molecular structure which ultimately becomes the quinoline ring of ciprofloxacin. This is the position which in the final product, ciprofloxacin, the molecule contains a carboxyl group."], ["[21]", "While each of the party's processes starts with a different compound, each different from one another and from the final ciprofloxacin product, in my view the evidence is clear that both the acetyl group, in the Apotex process, and the ethoxycarbonyl group, in the Bayer process, are synthetic equivalents, sometimes described as \"synthons\" of the carboxyl group in the number three position of the quinoline ring in the ciprofloxacin product."], ["[22]", "The evidence of Dr. Corey, an eminent organic chemist, introduced by Bayer in relation to this matter is clearly set out in his affidavit sworn July 12, 1994.", "\"12. For the purpose of synthesizing ciprofloxacin, the Apotex compound VI is an obvious chemical equivalent of the Bayer compound IX. The Apotex compound VI and the Bayer Compound IX are both members of the family called β-dicarbonyl compounds. In terms of the present application, their chemical properties and behaviour are so nearly identical that a competent chemist would consider them equivalent. Thus the Apotex process simply replaces one structural subunit in the Bayer patented intermediates, the ethoxycarbonyl (C00C", ") functional group, by another, the acetyl (COCH", ") functional group, which is a well-known and obvious chemical equivalent of the carboxyl group or alkyl esters thereof. Conversion of an acetyl group to a carboxyl group is a simple and routine manoeuvre in synthetic organic chemistry and was known to and routinely carried out by competent chemists of ordinary skill in the field of synthetic organic chemistry prior to 1980.\""], ["[23]", "That evidence is supported by the affidavit of Dr. Wuest. Moreover, in cross-examination on his affidavit adduced by Apotex, Dr. MacLelland agreed that conversion of the acetyl group to the carboxyl group was well known and a routine step in synthetic organic chemistry prior to 1980, and further that an acetyl group and an ethoxycarbonyl group are synthons for a carboxyl group."], ["[24]", "On this first difference between the parties' processes I am satisfied that while each starts with a different compound, the starting compound used by Apotex is an obvious chemical equivalent of that used in the Bayer patent in claim 1. In each case the element of difference, an acetyl group in the Apotex starting compound and an ethoxycarbonyl group in the Bayer starting compound, at the same molecular position as a carboxyl group in the structure of ciprofloxacin, is also an obvious chemical equivalent of the carboxyl group."], ["[25]", "The second difference in the parties' processes relied upon by Apotex when the matter was heard concerned the third step in each process, where an intermediate (formula VI  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (a) process and formula VIII in the Apotex process) was reacted with a DMF base. In the Bayer (a) process the next intermediate depicted shows that the quinoline ring has been closed and in addition the ethoxycarbonyl group has been converted to a carboxyl group. In the Apotex process, as in the Bayer (b) process, only the closing of the ring is depicted as a result of the reaction with the DMF base. I accept that the depiction of the Bayer (a) process on the chart drawn up for comparing the processes, in evidence before the court, omits recording here that the second change depicted in that process, conversion of the ethoxycarbonyl group to a carboxyl group at the three position on the ring, closed by reaction with the DMF base, is actually the result of a further step, alkaline hydrolysis, as noted in the patent and depicted as the final step in the chart depicting the Bayer (b) process. Further, that step of alkaline hydrolysis is a step in both processes Bayer (a) and (b), to convert the ethoxycarbonyl group to a carboxyl group, and in each case following cyclization, or closing, of the quinoline ring. The fact that it may occur at different stages in the production processes following cyclization does not appear to be a significant difference between the processes. Nor is it significant, in my view, that Apotex also uses alkaline hydrolysis as a final step in its process, but for a different purpose, to remove the protection from the piperazine which protection its process earlier introduced."], ["[26]", "This second difference pointed to by Apotex relates in part to the order in which various steps are taken in the processes of the parties. In the Bayer (a) process there are five steps, from starting material to production of ciprofloxacin,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (b) there are five steps, and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  there are six steps. The Bayer (a) and (b) processes start with the same compound, Apotex with another that I have found is an obvious chemical equivalent, and all three use the same reagents for reacting in the first three steps of the respective processes. Bayer (a) and (b) in effect reverse the order of the final two steps, i.e., reacting with piperazine, and then alkaline hydrolysis to convert the ethoxycarbonyl group to a carboxyl group, to form ciprofloxacin. In step 4 of its process, comparable to step 4  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (b) and step 5  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (a), Apotex uses a piperazine but in the case of Apotex it is a protected piperazine. In step 5 it uses an oxidation reaction to convert the acetyl group to a carboxyl group on the 3rd position of the quinoline ring and its final step, unnecessary in the Bayer process, is to \"deprotect\", by alkaline hydrolysis, the protected piperazine compound earlier used in step 4. This produces ciprofloxacin. I comment further on the third difference stressed by Apotex, the use of the protected piperazine for reaction at step 4 of its process. In view of my conclusion on that and conclusions on the two other differences in the processes, I am persuaded that the differences in the order of reactions, when the processes are compared, are not significant, and that the Apotex process follows essentially the same strategy of synthesis as that set out, for a synthetic organic chemist skilled in the art, by the Bayer patent."], ["[27]", "The third and final difference relied upon by Apotex is the use in its process of a protected piperazine compound. The Bayer process uses piperazine directly to react with the intermediate at step 4, whereas the Apotex process uses a protecting group (EtOOC) on the piperazine. I am not persuaded by the evidence of Dr. McClelland that the protecting group adds any particular advantage to the Apotex process. Protection of the reagent seems unnecessary, in the opinions of Drs. Corey and Wuest, in light of the Bayer process reacting directly with unprotected piperazine to produce good yield of ciprofloxacin, without the additional and time-consuming step of \"deprotecting\" the piperazine which is required by the Apotex process. Moreover, I am persuaded on the evidence before me that it is commonplace in organic chemistry, and a known and obvious practice for one skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry to add a protective group to a particular part of a molecule for purposes of temporary protection during a chemical reaction, and to remove the protection when no longer needed. That is set out in the affidavits of Drs. Corey and Wuest, confirmed in their cross-examination, and also in the cross-examination of Dr. McClelland."], ["[28]", "There are differences in the processes of the parties. Nevertheless, the similarities in steps in both processes, particularly in the early stages of preparation, are for the same purposes. The two different steps in the Apotex process are used in its preparation of ciprofloxacin because of differences it introduces which I find were known and obvious chemical equivalents of the Bayer process. Thus, oxidation in the Apotex process, by the well known haloform reaction, is required to convert the acetyl group included in its starting material, to a carboxyl group as required for ciprofloxacin. That step is for a purpose similar to the Bayer alkaline hydrolysis step to convert the ethoxycarbonyl group it starts with to the required carboxyl group, also by a well known process. The second difference in the Apotex process, reacting the intermediate with the protected piperazine and subsequently removing the protection by alkaline hydrolysis, I find, is a well known process in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, albeit apparently unnecessary here, serving the same purpose as the direct reaction with unprotected piperazine by Bayer which appears to produce good yield of ciprofloxacin."], ["[29]", "The differences here dealt with as the first and third of those relied on by Apotex when this matter was heard, are referred to in the affidavits of Drs. Corey and Wuest as trivial and chemically insignificant. Both conclude that, in their opinions, the differences between the processes are not significant, that the different compositions of molecules of their starting materials are obvious chemical equivalents, and the different processes used are based on well known synthetic organic chemical reactions. In sum, the Apotex process is said by both of them to be an obvious chemical equivalent of processes described in the Bayer patent. Needless to say, that view is not shared by Dr. McClelland, or by counsel for Apotex."], ["[30]", "Where there is difference between the evidence of Drs. Corey and Wuest for the applicants and that of Dr. McClelland for Apotex, I accept that provided by affidavits and cross-examination of the first two, both of whom are synthetic organic chemists. I do so because I find their evidence consistent, relating to the whole of the processes for preparation of ciprofloxacin from the starting materials, and not so concerned with details of the process, particularly the final step, as that of Dr. McClelland. I do so also because I infer that in evolution of its process Apotex has followed a process described by Dr. McClelland in his second affidavit in part as follows:", "\"8. In constructing pathways for the synthesis of a given target molecule, i.e., ciprofloxacin, organic chemists employ a technique known as 'retrosynthesis'. Retrosynthesis is a problem-solving technique that involves transforming a target molecule, i.e., ciprofloxacin, to progressively simpler molecules until simple or commercially available starting materials are reached. Such analysis invariably results in a number of different multistep pathways, or what is called a 'synthetic tree'. The concept of a 'synthetic equivalent' does arise in such analyses. A 'synthetic equivalent' or 'synthon' is defined as a part of a molecule that is related to some other structural unit by a reliable reaction or sequence of reactions. This concept is an important part of the bond disconnection that occurs in retrosynthetic analysis, since it means that some fragments can be replaced with their 'synthetic equivalent' ...", "\"9. There is no support to equate 'obvious chemical equivalent' and 'synthetic equivalent'. The terms 'obvious chemical equivalent' and indeed 'chemical equivalent' are not employed in the chemical field.\""], ["[31]", "If Apotex followed the technique of retrosynthesis in developing its process, as I assume it did, the fact that intermediates at each stage of its process are different from those at the comparable stages of the Bayer processes, as a result of starting with a different composition, is not, in my opinion, significant. Nor is it significant that those intermediates may well have been new, as Apotex claims, at the time of development of the Bayer patent, in 1980."], ["[32]", "Dr. McClelland's statement that the terms \"obvious chemical equivalent\" and \"chemical equivalent\" are not terms used in chemistry is interesting, but it is of no assistance in the construction of the first term, as used in the patent, or in the", "Regulations"], ["[33]", "Having considered the relevant evidence I turn to determination of the issue before the court.

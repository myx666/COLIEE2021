In my view, the Applicant is entitled to have the merits of her application properly assessed based on the facts of her case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "Some of the errors are as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "a) The Citizenship Judge noted that there appeared to be contradictory information in the Applicant's residency questionnaire and her resume with respect to the dates the Applicant worked as a Child Protection Officer in Afghanistan - the residency questionnaire indicated that she held this position from March 2001 to June 2002, whereas her resume stated that the position was from January 2000 to February 2002. The residency questionnaire asks applicants to list their employment and academic experience since their arrival in Canada. In accordance with these instructions, the Applicant stated that as of March 2001, when she arrived in Canada, she was a Child Protection Officer in Afghanistan. Thus, there was no actual contradiction. This is significant in light of the credibility concerns regarding the Applicant. However, in my view, this error by itself would not be sufficient to refer the matter back for redetermination;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "b) The Citizenship Judge stated that some passport stamps appeared inconsistent with absences listed on the Applicant's residency questionnaire. In particular, there were two stamps that, according to the Citizenship Judge, were from Pakistan and acquired during times when the Applicant had declared she was in Tajikistan. A review of the stamps indicates that the Citizenship Judge was incorrect with respect to both stamps. Both stamps are from Tajikistan;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "c) Although the Citizenship Judge noted that the Applicant said she returned to Canada in June 2002 and remained until August 2003, and also noted that the Applicant had lived in Canada for a period of one year as a visiting PhD scholar, the Citizenship Judge mistakenly stated as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "In March of 2004, you received a PhD in Gender and Ethnic Studies from the University of Greenwich, London, England, after a year of study. It is unclear whether your husband visited with you, or lived with you in London. Your daughters remained in Canada ....  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "In my view, this is a significant error of fact, as the Applicant did not live in London at any time during the relevant four-year period, including the period during which she completed her PhD. From June 2002 to August 2003, she was living in Canada with her husband and two daughters. From August 2003 to March 2004, the Applicant was living in Tajikistan while working for UNICEF. The Applicant visited London on five occasions during the relevant four-year period for the purpose of meeting with the supervisor of her doctoral studies. These visits were for short periods during which the Applicant could not have been considered a resident of the United Kingdom;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "d) In reference to an email sent by the Applicant outside the relevant four-year period to the Canadian Women's Club in Barbados in which the Applicant asked whether there were any Iranian-Canadian members in the Club, the Citizenship Judge noted as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "It is reasonable to assume that the most obvious place to find Iranian-Canadian women is in Canada, not in Barbados; as a result, the email request suggests that you may not have developed friendships with many Iranian-Canadian women when you lived in Canada for a year as a visiting PhD scholar.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "This inference of fact is unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. The Applicant's attempt to seek out other Iranian-Canadian women does not suggest that the Applicant did not develop friendships with women of her nationality in Canada. In addition, the email and the Applicant's membership in this group indicates that, regardless of where the Applicant is living, she takes the initiative to surround herself with Canadian people. This finding is supported by a letter of recommendation from Mr. William Patton, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan, in which he states that the Applicant \"maintains good contacts with other Canadians in Tajikistan.\" It is further supported by the Applicant's residency questionnaire in which she lists her involvement with numerous Canadian organizations and says, \"I also have some of my best friends based in Canada and these include immigrants and new citizens but also many 'old' Canadians. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "With respect to the Citizenship Judge's application of the", "Re Koo", "factors, the principle errors are as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "a) The Citizenship Judge stated that the Applicant was present in Canada for 283 days within the relevant four-year period. In fact, the Applicant was physically present in Canada for a total of 691 days and not the stated 283 days. However, the Citizenship Judge stated the correct number of days that the Applicant was physically present in Canada in both her factual findings and in her assessment of the fourth", "Re Koo", "factor. Thus, this error, alone, in my view, is not sufficient to warrant a redetermination of the application. I regard it as a typo;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "b) In her analysis of the third", "Koo", "factor, the Citizenship Judge noted, in part, as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "You have provided insufficient evidence to establish that you intend to make Canada your primary place of residence or that you are working to establish a domicile which your family can refer to as a home. The onus is on you to provide sufficient documentary evidence to establish residency. There are no credit card transaction records, telephone records, household receipts, or daily banking records to reflect your purchases during the relevant four-year period. Due in part to the paucity of documentation provided to demonstrate a sustained presence in Canada, plus the fact that you presently live in Barbados and will continue to do so until your contract expires in 2019, it is reasonable to conclude that you do not reside in Canada and that you may not intend to return to Canada permanently.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The Citizenship Judge listed the documentary evidence submitted by the Applicant at the beginning of her Decision, but she failed to consider this evidence when she assessed whether the Applicant intended to make Canada her primary place of residence. Although the Applicant did not submit the passive indicia listed by the Citizenship Judge above, there was other documentary evidence available, including the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- she is a co-owner of a house in Toronto;", "- she has made almost monthly wire transfers to a Canadian bank account shared with her husband since August 2001;", "- there are utility bills (although many of the bills submitted fall outside the relevant four-year period, there is one bill from 2004 and another from 2005);", "- there is an Ontario health card and a letter from her doctor in Toronto attesting to the fact that the Applicant has been his patient since 2002 and visits him every few months.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Further, the Citizenship Judge failed to consider that: (i) the Applicant does not own property elsewhere; (ii) the Applicant returns to Canada after each of her absences and as frequently as possible; and (iii) the Applicant's stay in any other country is only temporary and for work-related purposes. The Citizenship Judge also erred by failing to address the Applicant's family ties in conjunction with these other indicia of residence which, taken together, suggest that the Applicant has the intention of maintaining permanent roots in Canada. As stated in", "Re Ho", ", [1997] F.C.J. No. 1747 (F.C.T.D.) at paragraph 7:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "...residency in Canada for the purposes of citizenship does not imply full-time physical presence. The place of residence of a person is not where that person works but where he or she returns to after work. Hence, an applicant for citizenship who has clearly and definitively established a home in Canada with the transparent intention of maintaining permanent roots in this country ought not to be deprived of citizenship merely because he has to earn his livelihood and that of his family by doing business offshore. The most eloquent indicia of residency is the permanent establishment of a person and his family in the country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "c) The most significant error, in my view, appears in the Citizenship Judge's analysis of the sixth", "Koo", "factor, which relates to the quality of the Applicant's connection with Canada and whether it is more substantial than her connection with any other country. The Citizenship Judge observed as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "There is no question that you have performed laudable work within the global community as a UNICEF employee. Nevertheless, you have chosen to accept employment in countries outside Canada at a time when you knew that by doing so, you might incur a residency shortfall when seeking citizenship. You have been outside of Canada more often than you have been in it. As for your family, your husband and daughters are Canadian citizens, but you will not return to join them in Canada until 2019. By that time, the dynamics of your family may have changed, and they may live elsewhere or under different circumstances, or perhaps even different countries. With that in mind, on the basis of the evidence before me, I am not persuaded that you have established a substantial connection with Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "This factor requires the Citizenship Judge to undertake a comparison to determine whether the Applicant's connection with Canada is more substantial than with any other country. In this case, the comparison would be with Barbados, Iran, or any other country where the Applicant has spent a significant amount of time or has a substantial connection. The Citizenship Judge's failure to do this constitutes a failure to properly apply the facts to this part of the", "Koo", "test, which in turn raises doubts as to whether the Citizenship Judge had a proper understanding of the law. On the facts of this case, Canada is the only country where the Applicant can be said to have centralized her mode of existence. This is where her children and her family are and this is where she comes when she has a break from her demanding international career and work for UNICEF. It is very telling, I feel, that the Citizenship Judge failed to make the comparison between the Applicant's connection to Canada and her connection with \"any other country.\" Had she done so, the only conclusion on the facts is that Canada is the only country with which the Applicant has a connection, and this would have to impact the Judge's assessment of the quality of the Applicant's connection with Canada. Not to have made such a comparison renders the Decision unreasonable, and certainly does so when taken in conjunction with other errors;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "d) The Judge is also highly critical of the Applicant's response to question 13 in the residency questionnaire and complains that the Applicant concentrates upon her institutional and education ties, and that the Applicant does not \"describe [her] daily acclimatization to Canada, including the ways in which [she makes it her] home, nor [does she] provide observations about the challenges of adapting to Canada's society and customs.\" What is troubling about this response is that question 13 in the Residence Questionnaire specifically directs applicants, when describing social ties, to focus upon \"active memberships in community or religious organizations, volunteer groups, etc.\" This is what the Applicant did, and yet she is faulted for not doing something else. In the absence of an explanation on this point from the Citizenship Judge, such criticism appears to be unreasonable given the directions contained in question 13.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "I have not referred to every mistake and error made by the Judge. But what I have referred to is, in my view, sufficient to render the Decision unreasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "The number of factual errors and the misapplication of the", "Koo", "factors in this case are of such significance that they leave me with little confidence in the soundness of the other conclusions reached by the Citizenship Judge. Although some of these errors alone would not be sufficient to warrant a rehearing of the application, I am satisfied that they are cumulatively sufficient to warrant intervention by this Court. For these reasons, the appeal is allowed. Because of this finding, I need not consider the remaining issues raised by the Applicant in this appeal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "JUDGMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "1.

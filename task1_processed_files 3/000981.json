Under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the", "Act", ", an applicant is required to have accumulated at least three years or residence in Canada within the four years immediately preceding his or her application.", "\"According to the evidence in your file and presented to me at your hearing, your absences from Canada total more than one year in the four years preceding your application. In these circumstances, you had to satisfy me, in order to meet the residence requirements, that your absences from Canada, could be counted as a period of residence in Canada.", "\"Federal Court precedents require that, to establish residence, an individual must show, in mind and in fact, a centralization of his or her mode of living in Canada. If such residence is established, absences from Canada do not affect this residence, as long as it is demonstrated that the individual left for a temporary purpose only and maintained in Canada some real and tangible form of residence.", "\"From the documents contained in your file and given to me at your hearing, I noted the following facts. You arrived in Canada accompanied by your wife and children on July 13, 1989. You left Canada on August 14, 1989, for a business trip since you did not end your professional activities in your country of origin so as not to suffer any financial losses.", "\"In the questionnaire on residence, you declared that you took up residency at 335 Deguire Blvd., Apt. 312 in Ville St-Laurent, Québec and you signed a lease on July 26, 1989, for the apartment in question. You opened a bank account at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on July 28, 1989. You registered your children in schools of the Ste-Croix School Board and the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal for the school year 1989-90. You obtained a Quebec driver's licence that was issued on November 2, 1989, upon your return from your first trip abroad as a permanent resident. Also, you filed copies of your income tax returns for 1989, 1990, 1991.", "\"I concluded, after examining the documents on file and the information you gave me at your hearing, that between July 13, 1989, the date you arrived to Canada and August 14, 1989, the date that you left Canada on a business trip, you did not establish yourself in Canada for the simple reason that your time in Canada was too short to do so and that you did not establish particular ties with Canada, even though you left your family in Canada. In your letter you indicated that you returned to Canada at every opportunity to see your family and monitor the progress of the members of your family as well as to familiarize yourself with your adopted country. This declaration left me under the impression that your stays in Canada were simply visits to a country that you like and wish to know more than a country where you wish to put down roots and build a life and a future.", "\"According to a decision rendered by the Honorable Judge Muldoon rendered in Ottawa on March first, 1993 in the case of", "Abolghasem Pourghasemi", ", Judge Muldoon said:", "'(...) must first throw in their lot with Canadians by residing among Canadians, in Canada, during three of the preceding four years, in order to Canadianize themselves.

He first leased a home in Ville St-Laurent and then moved to Dollard Des Ormeaux where he presently resides with his family. The children were registered in school. I have no evidence that the appellant's wife was ever employed for remuneration. The appellant was the sole support of his family and he did this by carrying on business in the United Arab Emirates. The appellant states that he had made his trips for business to obtain funds from persons who allegedly owed him money. He states that he does no business in Canada because of the recession.

This happens by \"rubbing elbows\" with Canadians in shopping malls, corner stores, libraries, concert halls, auto repair shops, pubs, cabarets, elevators, churches, synagogues, mosques and temples - in a word wherever one can meet and converse with Canadians - during the prescribed three years. One can observe Canadian society for all its virtues, decadence, values, dangers and freedoms, just as it is. That is little enough time in which to become Canadianized. If a citizenship candidate misses that qualifying experience, then Canadian citizenship can be conferred, in effect, on a person who is still a foreigner in experience, social adaptation, and often in thought and outlook. If the criterion be applied to some citizenship candidates, it ought to apply to all. So, indeed, it was applied by Madam Justice Reed in", "Re Koo", ", T-20-92, on December 3, 1992, in different factual circumstances, of course.'", "\"I am in total agreement with this statement of Mr. Justice Muldoon.\""], ["[10]", "In the same", "Lo", "case, I state, at page 2:", "\"The reason for the Citizenship judge refusing the appellant's application is that the appellant is short 305 days of the required 1095 days.

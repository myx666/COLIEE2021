The RPD found that this allegation lacked both credibility and sufficient reliable corroborative evidence and, in this respect discarded a letter from Mr. Chowdhury's father as being self-serving.

Rather, it seems to me that the RPD's predicated its decision on the IFA issue by the fact Mr. Chowdhury: faced no problems while away from his home area; failed to provide sufficient evidence of adverse conditions which would jeopardize his life, and that of his wife, in relocating to Chittagong; and did not show that it would be objectively unreasonable to request him to seek refuge in that part of Bangladesh."], ["[28]", "As previously noted, the issue before me has to do with the reasonableness of the RPD's decision. What this means is that my role is not to reweigh the evidence that was before the RPD and substitute my own findings. The findings of the RPD are owed deference because determining whether someone is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the Act falls within its area of expertise. My role is therefore limited and I can only interfere with the RPD's IFA finding in this case if it lacks justification, transparency and intelligibility, and if it falls outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes, defensible in fact and in law (", "Dunsmuir,", "at para 47)."], ["[29]", "Based on these reasons, I find that the Applicants have failed to show that the proposed IFA is unreasonable or that the RPD committed an error which warrants my intervention in this regard."], ["[30]", "My conclusion would be the same even accepting the Applicants' assertion that the RPD's IFA finding was predicated on Mr. Chowdhury's political profile. As Mr. Chowdhury's political implication was on the low-end of the spectrum it would have been reasonably open to the RPD, in my view, to find it implausible that he would be tracked down by the ALP or the police and, as a result, face a serious possibility of being subjected to persecution."], ["[31]", "According to this Court's jurisprudence, the RPD has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony and in so doing, to gauge the credibility of an account and draw the necessary inferences. This means that it is entitled to make credibility findings based on implausibility, common sense and rationality.

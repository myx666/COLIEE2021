{"id_": "076777", "body_str": [["[1]", "Pelletier, J.", ": Merlin Kaczmar (\"Kacz­mar\") is an employee of Revenue Canada in Calgary, Alberta. He applied for the position of Team Coordinator, Audit in a closed competition. He was unsuccessful in the competition and, exercising his rights under s. 21 of the", "Public Service Employment Act", ", R.S.C. 1985 c. P-33 (the \"", "Act", "\") he launched an appeal against the selection for employment made in that competition."], ["[2]", "The facts are straightforward. Kaczmar challenges a competition in which one of the selection tools was a standardized test, In-Basket Exercise 820. The result of the com­petition was that 19 candidates were found qualified for appointment to the position in question, Team Coordinator, Audit. Kaczmar was not among them and exercised his right of appeal under s. 21 of the", "Act", ". It appears that Kaczmar did not meet the minimum score for In-Basket Exercise 820 whereas most of the successful candidates had scored 20 or more out of 30. Naturally enough, Kaczmar is curious as to how the In-Basket Exercise is scored, given his anomalous result. His request for disclosure of the test materials was met by a refusal on the part of the Public Service Commission to provide access to the materials or copies of it except upon terms which Kaczmar found unaccept­able. The grounds of the Public Service Commission's refusal was that disclosure would prejudice the continued use of the standardized test. According to the Chairper­son's reasons, the foundation for this claim was the assertion of a common sense prop­osition that if Kaczmar was given access to materials in which the candidate scored very high, it would be tantamount to giving him an answer sheet and would give him an unfair advantage in any subsequent writing of the test. On that basis, the Chairperson made an order as to disclosure which reads as follows:", "\"1. The appellant's representative, present­ly Dave Riffel of the Professional Institute of the Public Service, will be given unlimited time to review the test materials. The appellant, Mr. Kaczmar will be restricted to a period of 20 minutes of review for each test paper. Neither Mr. Riffel nor Mr. Kaczmar will be given access to the scoring manual for the IBE 820. Access to the scoring manual and test materials including the papers of Mr. Kaczmar and the successful candidates, will be given to an individual of the appel­lant's choosing, who has appropriate quali­fications to review and evaluate the test and scoring manual.", "\"2. Mr. Riffel will be allowed to take unrestricted personal notes and photocopies of the materials presented to him during disclosure. He may retain them in his possession for the purpose of this appeal, subject to his undertaking to maintain confidentiality of those materials, and subject further to paragraph 4 below.", "\"3. The appellant will be subject to a waiting period of 180 days before being permitted to write the IBE 820. This period will run from the last occasion on which he sees the test materials, whether at disclosure or at the hearing of his appeal.", "\"4. At the conclusion of the hearing into the merits of this appeal, all materials relevant to the IBE 820 in the possession of the appellant, his representative, and any other person to whom they may have been disclosed pursuant to paragraph 1, will be placed in a sealed envelope, to be retained on the Public Service Commission Appeal Board file. This will include their personal notes.", "\"5. In the event of an application for judi­cial review, the materials will be returned to the appellant's representative, on request. In the event that the period for judicial review expires without further application, the test materials will be returned to the Personnel Psychology Centre of the Public Service Commission, on request. The personal notes will be destroyed.\""], ["[3]", "In addition the Chairperson excluded from the materials to be disclosed the test materials of a number of candidates who had been appointed to positions as a result of an earlier closed competition or had declined appointment. It was her position that in the result, none of these individuals could be appointed to the position which was the subject of the competition and accordingly, they could not be considered to be a success­ful candidate."], ["[4]", "The Attorney General of Canada seeks judicial review of that part of the order allowing Kaczmar's representative to take notes and photocopies of the test material. Kaczmar brings his own application for judicial review of the decision to withhold production of the scoring manual to his representative and well as from the withhold­ing of the test results of individuals who have since accepted other positions.

Such situation has been described and estab­lished by authority as a quasi-lis between quasi-parties.\"", "'In such adversarial proceedings, parties are entitled to be represented. Such rep­resentation must be effective, in the sense that counsel or representative must have an opportunity of knowing what evidence will be given by the witnesses that he or she will call. He or she must have the opportunity of reviewing the evidence of the expert witness, of orga­nizing the evidence, of ensuring that the evidence is coherent, of emphasizing its best features and of preparing the witness for cross-examination. These are the normal functions of counsel. Without access to all relevant information and in particular, the confidential information upon which the expert evidence would be based and upon which the witness could be cross-examined, counsel or a representative cannot properly perform the task of persuading the court or tribu­nal as to the merits of the client's case.'", "\"[15] In this case, the Appeal Board, in its decision, ignored this role of counsel or representative by limiting disclosure only to a person who could give evidence before the tribunal. In making such a ruling, the Appeal Board erred by denying the applicants the right to have their repre­sentative, who was in charge of managing and conducting their case, know the same information that would be known be known by his potential witness. While the Appeal Board's concern with confidential­ity was appropriate, it was an error for the Appeal Board to limit disclosure in the manner it did.\""], ["[10]", "On the basis of this reasoning, the scoring manual ought to be disclosed to Kazmar's representative. The difficulty from Kaczmar's point of view is the decision of Richard, J. (as he then was), in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in which the learned judge held that a scoring manual did not contain \"infor­mation that pertains to the appellant or to the successful candidate ...\" and therefore was not subject to disclosure. The basis of the decision was that the manual did not contain information specific to a candidate. This ruling was made in the course of a case where the primary issue was whether the Appeal Board could distinguish, for purposes of disclosure, between the appellant and his/her representative. Richard, J., concluded that there was no basis for such a distinction so that if the scoring manual was subject to disclosure, it would have to be given to the appellant himself. This does not change the nature of the manual, but it does change the consequences of disclosure. I believe that the result in", "Hasan", "was dictated by the circum­stances of the case."], ["[11]", "Hasan", "was considered by McGillis, J., in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 161 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.).

Counsel for the respondent submitted, among other things, that the scoring man­ual was not subject to disclosure under the terms of s. 24(1) of the amended", "Regula­tions", "on the basis of the jurisprudence decided in the context of the previous", "Regulations", ". I cannot accept that argu­ment. In my opinion, the amended legisla­tive scheme was designed in order to balance the competing interests of the appellant in receiving full disclosure and of the government in protecting the confiden­tiality and integrity of the standardized tests. In order to achieve the appropriate balance, the amended", "Regulations", "provide for full disclosure to an appellant, recog­nizing that circumstances nevertheless may exist in which disclosure should be refused or granted subject to conditions in order to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the standardized test. Indeed, the amend­ments clearly contemplate that documents or information pertaining to a standardized test will be subject to disclosure; other­wise, there would be no necessity for the provisions granting discretionary powers to the deputy head, Commission and appeal board in relation to standardized tests. The scoring manual is one of the documents directly related to the administration and use of the standardized test and, as such, may be information or a document '... that pertains to the appellant or to the success­ful candidate and that is liable to be dis­closed before the appeal board', within the meaning of s. 24(1). The question of whether a scoring manual ought to be disclosed to an appellant under s. 24(1) depends on its relevance in the context of the facts of the case. However, even if the scoring manual is subject to disclosure on the facts of a particular case, the deputy head or the Commission and the appeal board may exercise their various discre­tionary powers under the amended", "Regula­tions", ".\""], ["[12]", "In her reasons, McGillis, J., notes that the practice of the Public Service Commis­sion, prior to", "Hasan", ", was to disclose the scoring manual as a matter of course, subject to conditions designed to protect the continu­ing utility of the test. That history puts the question of disclosure of the scoring manual into perspective."], ["[13]", "In my view, there is no reason that the scoring manual cannot be a document subject to disclosure pursuant to s. 24(1) of the", "Regulations", ". The test is whether the docu­ment contains information which pertains to the appellant and the successful candidate and, whether it is \"liable to be disclosed before the appeal board\". Without recourse to the scoring manual, Kaczmar and his representatives would have access to certain test papers which have been scored but would not be able to assess the consistency of scoring. Presumably the disclosure to a psychologist is intended to allay their fears on that issue. However, this is an adversarial process and Kaczmar's task is persuade the Appeal Board. Having his fears allayed does not assist in that process. The scoring man­ual contains information which pertains to the applicant and to the successful candidate, in that recourse to the scoring handbook is necessary to make sense of the candidates' test results. It therefore meets the first leg of the test in s. 24(1)."], ["[14]", "The expression \"liable to be disclosed before the appeal board\" is a curious turn of phrase. One does not ordinarily speak of documents being disclosed before a tribunal. Disclosure is a practice which occurs at the pre-hearing stage when the parties exchange relevant documents for the purpose of nar­rowing the issues in the litigation. In my view, the expression must be read in the context of a provision which is attempting to define which documents are to be made available to an appellant. The first require­ment is that the documents must contain information which pertains to the candidates. This does not necessarily mean relevant information since the information must simply \"pertain\" to the appellant or to the successful candidate. The second require­ment, that the document is liable to be dis­closed before the appeal board, should there­fore be read so as to import the requirement of relevance, since it is relevance which determines whether a document will be accepted as evidence before a tribunal.

Is each of those persons", "the", "successful candidate?

Because the legislation contem­plates that names on the eligibility list will be ranked by order of merit, there is an issue as to merit between the appellant and each person whose name which appears above his or hers. The order of placement of the name on the list reflects a determination of relative merit as between the appellant and each of those candidates. Since each person whose name appears on the list above that of the appellant should be appointed prior to the appellant, each of those persons represents a successful candidate from the point of view of the appellant. That is certainly so at the time the list is created. Is there a rationale for dealing with the list at some date other than the date of its creation? The successful candidate is defined by reference to being placed on the list ahead of the appellant, a state of affairs which came into being at the time the list was created. Subsequent events do not alter the relative ranking. More im­portantly, subsequent events do not alter the fairness and consistency of the ranking.

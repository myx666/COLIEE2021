When he was fifteen years old, he became sexually intimate with a male student. Nobody knew about this relationship until his friend was caught with another man who had HIV.

The reasons most commonly invoked to support such a requirement are that it leads to better reasoned and more articulate decisions, that it reinforces public confidence in the judgment and fairness of administrative tribunals, and that it allows parties to assess the strength of a particular ruling and to determine the grounds upon which they may wish to appeal or to apply for judicial review: see, in particular,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."], ["[11]", "In the present case, it is not necessary to go through the factors that have been considered relevant to determining the content of the duty of fairness. The", "IRPA", ", like its predecessor, the", "Immigration Act", ", R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, imposes a statutory duty on the Board to provide reasons.

The simple and unequivocal answer is no. The Board's reasons fail to meet even a skeletal threshold. The absence of any analysis makes a mockery of the right to judicial review. It is impossible to review a decision without being able to evaluate the decision-maker's reasons. Furthermore, the Board's reasons here do not refer to many issues that were critical to Mr. Shwaba's claim."], ["[18]", "In fact, these very issues were raised by the Board itself at the outset of the hearing (Tribunal Record, page 103). The first has to do with Mr. Shwaba's credibility. This Court has stated on a number of occasions that whether a claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution is a question of mixed fact and law, and calls for a careful analysis of the claimant's testimony and of the documentary evidence about country conditions. Here, we have none of the two."], ["[19]", "For example, it is not entirely clear what Mr. Shwaba's precipitating reason was for fleeing Grenada. His two stories respecting this issue - first at the point of entry, and then in his PIF - are not entirely consistent. Does he fear returning to Grenada because of his stepfather, or because gays are persecuted in his country? And why would telling his aunt about his stepfather's abuse put him at risk? According to his PIF, Mr. Shwaba had already told his mother (Tribunal Record, page 18). As well, according to the notes at the Port of Entry, his community knows about his stepfather's history of abuse (Tribunal Record, page 84). Yet, the Board did not deal with these issues, though the member actually raised them during the hearing, and did not explain how these inconsistencies were resolved in Mr. Shwaba's favour."], ["[20]", "Similarly, there is no discussion about the country conditions in Grenada with respect to the alleged persecution of homosexuals. The only document dealing with the situation of homosexuals listed in the Board's Information Package (footnoted in the third paragraph of the Board's reasons) is ten years old. The U.S. Department of State Report of February 28, 2005, does not mention this subject at all. How, then, could the Board member be certain \"that there is legislation in Grenada that does not protect people of his sexual orientation\"?"], ["[21]", "The Board's reasons are equally deficient because it is impossible to tell whether it considered the issue of state protection. How do we know whether Mr. Shwaba satisfied his burden and exhausted avenues of recourse available in his country of origin? Does that mean all homosexuals from Grenada are eligible for refugee status? These are all questions that beg for an assessment and analysis before they can be properly answered."], ["[22]", "The reasons are also devoid of any comment about the fact that Mr. Shwaba returned to Grenada twice, after having visited relatives in Trinidad. Nor is there any consideration of the delay between Mr. Shwaba's arrival in Canada and when he made his refugee claim, and of the impact such delay might have on Mr. Shwaba's credibility and his subjective fear."], ["[23]", "In the result, I find the reasons to be clearly insufficient and inappropriate to fulfill any of the rationales for requiring them. The Board cannot be absolved of its duty to provide reasons, pursuant to s. 169 of the", "IRPA", ", simply because the Minister did not intervene at the hearing. The Minister and the public at large have the right to see that the system is properly applied and that the integrity of the Board's decision-making process is maintained."], ["[24]", "Accordingly, this application for judicial review will be allowed, the Board's decision will be set aside and the matter will be referred back to the Board for rehearing and redetermination by a differently constituted panel.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[25]", "THIS COURT ORDERS that", "the application for judicial review is allowed.

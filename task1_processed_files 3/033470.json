Mr. Khan testified before the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (\"RPD\" or \"panel\") that he fears members of the Mohajir Quami Movement (\"MQM\"), a political party in Pakistan. His fear stems, he testified, from an incident when he and his late brother-in-law were the only witnesses to the killing of a Shia doctor and two patients by three members of the MQM.

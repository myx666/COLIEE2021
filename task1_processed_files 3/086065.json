Further, the Board held that had it found her to be credible, she had nonetheless failed to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. The Federal Court set aside that decision on the basis that the Board imposed too high a standard of proof on Ms. Carrillo regarding the lack of state protection.

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened.", "In PRRA applications, it is the applicant who bears the burden of proof:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .", "The standard of proof in civil matters and in administrative processes is the balance of probabilities. In this PRRA application the Applicant must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be subject to risk of persecution, danger of torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Jamaica. That is proved by presenting evidence to the officer. In this respect the Applicant also has an evidentiary burden. The Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of each of the facts that has to be proved. One of those facts involves her sexual orientation. As will be discussed below, I hold that she did present some evidence of her sexual orientation and thus can be said to have met her evidentiary burden -- she presented evidence of each material fact in issue.", "As the Court of Appeal pointed out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> not all evidence is of the same quality. Accordingly, while an applicant may have met the evidentiary burden because evidence of each essential fact has been presented, he may not have met the legal burden because the evidence presented does not prove the facts required on the balance of probabilities. The legal burden of proof is met, in this case, when the Applicant proves to the officer, on the balance of probabilities, that she is lesbian.", "The determination of whether the evidence presented meets the legal burden will depend very much on the weight given to the evidence that has been presented.", "When a PRRA applicant offers evidence, in either oral or documentary form, the officer may engage in two separate assessments of that evidence. First, he may assess whether the evidence is credible. When there is a finding that the evidence is not credible, it is in truth a finding that the source of the evidence is not reliable. Findings of credibility may be made on the basis that previous statements of the witness contradict or are inconsistent with the evidence now being offered (see for example", "Karimi,", "above), or because the witness failed to tender this important evidence at an earlier opportunity, thus bringing into question whether it is a recent fabrication (see for example", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2004 FC 39). Documentary evidence may also be found to be unreliable because its author is not credible. Self-serving reports may fall into this category. In either case, the trier of fact may assign little or no weight to the evidence offered based on its reliability, and hold that the legal standard has not been met.", "If the trier of fact finds that the evidence is credible, then an assessment must be made as to the weight that is to be given to it. It is not only evidence that has passed the test of reliability that may be assessed for weight. It is open to the trier of fact, in considering the evidence, to move immediately to an assessment of weight or probative value without considering whether it is credible. Invariably this occurs when the trier of fact is of the view that the answer to the first question is irrelevant because the evidence is to be given little or no weight, even if it is found to be reliable evidence. For example, evidence of third parties who have no means of independently verifying the facts to which they testify is likely to be ascribed little weight, whether it is credible or not.", "Evidence tendered by a witness with a personal interest in the matter may also be examined for its weight before considering its credibility because typically this sort of evidence requires corroboration if it is to have probative value. If there is no corroboration, then it may be unnecessary to assess its credibility as its weight will not meet the legal burden of proving the fact on the balance of probabilities. When the trier of fact assesses the evidence in this manner he or she is not making a determination based on the credibility of the person providing the evidence; rather, the trier of fact is simply saying the evidence that has been tendered does not have sufficient probative value, either on its own or coupled with the other tendered evidence, to establish on the balance of probability, the fact for which it has been tendered.

Had it been supported by other corroborative evidence such as evidence from her lesbian partner(s), public statements, and the like, it would have attracted even more weight.", "The weight the trier of fact gives evidence tendered in a proceeding is not a science. Persons may weigh evidence differently but there is a reasonable range of weight within which the assessment of the evidence's weight should fall. Deference must be given to PRRA officers in their assessment of the probative value of evidence before them. If it falls within the range of reasonableness, it should not be disturbed. In my view the weight given counsel's statement in this matter falls within that range.", "It is also my view that there is nothing in the officer's decision under review which would indicate that any part of it was based on the Applicant's credibility. The officer neither believes nor disbelieves that the Applicant is lesbian -- he is unconvinced. He states that there is insufficient objective evidence to establish that she is lesbian.

In Ferguson, it is suggested that such corroborative evidence could include a sworn statement by a partner and evidence of public statements (at paragraph 32). One must remember that evidence must have sufficient probative value. It will have sufficient probative value when \"it convinces the trier of fact\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 30). Furthermore, the officer had to consider all of the other factors in the case in making the determination (Parchment at paragraph 28).", "The statement in this case was sworn, unlike those in Parchment and Ferguson, which does give it more weight.

Officers can only avoid credibility findings and decide applications on the basis of sufficiency of evidence if their decisions show that, credibility aside, what the applicant has to say is not sufficient, on the applicable standard of proof, to show that he or she faces a risk under either section 96 or section 97. In other words, it has to be a situation where a credibility finding is not necessary in order to decide the probative value of evidence so that, whether or not an applicant is being truthful, their evidence is not sufficient to establish persecution or a section 97 risk.

That evidence is just too vague and speculative about forward-looking risk to discharge the standard of proof applicable in this situation. The Applicant, knowing full well that his evidence was a concern, and represented by counsel alive to the credibility/sufficiency line of cases in this Court, chose not to address those sufficiency issues in his application.

If the Decision was based upon credibility, there would be no need for counsel to now say that he was incompetent for not providing further corroborative evidence.

In effect then, on the incompetence issue, we have counsel attempting to give evidence by way of argument in a motion where he remains counsel for the Applicant. Rule 82 makes it clear that a solicitor cannot both depose to an affidavit and present argument to the court based on that affidavit except with leave of the court. Counsel has not sworn an affidavit in this case but is attempting to give evidence on his own incompetence by way of argument.

The Applicant was provided with three opportunities to explain the value of the offence he committed and the meaning of his admission that the fraud consisted of \"$117 million worth of phone calls\".

I agree that the sentence of five months imprisonment and a $50 fine is not an overly harsh punishment. However, absent expert evidence on sentencing in Illinois on matters such as these, it is impossible to draw any inferences from the length of the sentence. From the remarks of Judge Alesia in the Sentencing Reasons, it appears that the Judge took into accout that the Principal Applicant was unable and unlikely to pay a fine. Moreover, the record discloses that the Principal Applicant was prepared to be an informer; this factor may have been a reason or a reduced sentence.

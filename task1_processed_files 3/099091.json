Shortly thereafter, the family claimed refugee protection, asserting that they had a well-founded fear of persecution in the United States, based upon Mr. Hinzman's political opinion.

Finally, the applicants argue that the Board erred in failing to properly consider the fact that an objection to a particular war is not recognized as a legitimate basis on which to grant conscientious objector status in the United States.

He chose a four year term of service. He also had a choice of positions within the army, and elected to be an Infantryman. He explained that \"... if I was going to be in the army ... I was going to experience the essence of the army, which is what the Infantry is. I mean, when you watch a war movie and you see the people shooting back and forth or whatever else, that's the feel\"."], ["[9]", "Although he says that he was a practising Buddhist prior to enlisting in the Army, it appears that, at the outset of his military service, Mr. Hinzman did not have any qualms about bearing arms or otherwise participating in active military service."], ["[10]", "Mr. Hinzman explained that as he went through basic training, he was exposed to a process of desensitization, involving a dehumanization of the enemy. This process included having the recruits repeat chants about killing, raping and pillaging. Mr. Hinzman initially thought that this was all done in good fun, but subsequently began to question his involvement in such activity."], ["[11]", "Mr. Hinzman evidently excelled in his military training, achieving the rank of Private, First Class, with a \"Specialist\" rating. He was one of the select few chosen for the \"pre-Ranger course\". The Ranger program is an elite leadership training course which enables individuals to deal with combat situations successfully, by making the right decisions with limited resources. Obtaining the Ranger certification would have greatly enhanced Mr. Hinzman's career prospects within the army."], ["[12]", "Before the Board, Mr. Hinzman testified that during this period, he was \"kind of living a double life\". While he continued to do very well at his military training, the concerns about killing that Mr. Hinzman had started to develop in basic training had continued to grow, as he explored a world view framed by Buddhist teachings, which resulted in a deepening of his religious beliefs. He says that he gradually came to realize that he had a significant inhibition against the taking of human life, stating that his concerns in this regard came to a head as he was on the verge of starting the pre-Ranger course, when he realized that he was \"at a point of no return\", and that he \"couldn't do it anymore\"."], ["[13]", "Mr. Hinzman says that he did not discuss his concerns with anyone outside his family at this time. He did, however, become aware that the US Army allows personnel to apply for conscientious objector status. This policy allows soldiers to be reassigned to non-combatant duties where the soldier objects to bearing arms, and also permits the complete separation of the individual from the military, where the individual objects to war of all kinds."], ["[14]", "In August of 2002, Mr. Hinzman decided to seek reassignment to non-combatant duties as a conscientious objector. He testified that he did not ask to be discharged from the Army, as he felt an obligation to complete his four year contract, and was willing to continue to serve as a medic, truck driver, cook, administrator or any other position that did not require him to kill anyone."], ["[15]", "While he acknowledged that an early release from the Army would have limited the educational benefits to which he would be entitled, Mr. Hinzman says that this was not a factor in his decision to seek reassignment while remaining in the Army."], ["[16]", "In his application for conscientious objector status, Mr. Hinzman stated that it was his belief that war in any guise was wrong, and that he could no longer be part of a unit that was trained to kill.

It seems to have somehow gone astray, and was never dealt with by the Army on its merits."], ["[19]", "At the end of October, 2002, when Mr. Hinzman realized that his application had not been dealt with, he submitted a new application. By this point, it had become clear to Mr. Hinzman that his unit was to be deployed to fight in Afghanistan as part of \"Operation Enduring Freedom\". Because of the timing of Mr. Hinzman's second application, it appeared that his application had been precipitated by his learning of his imminent deployment to Afghanistan, when in fact this was not the case."], ["[20]", "Although Mr. Hinzman did not know whether the American military action in Afghanistan had been sanctioned by a resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations, he was nonetheless of the view that the United States had a legitimate basis for going into Afghanistan. Mr. Hinzman explained that he was satisfied that there were links between the Taliban regime then in power in Afghanistan and al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda being the terrorist organization responsible for the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States."], ["[21]", "Accordingly, Mr. Hinzman went with his unit to Afghanistan, where he was assigned kitchen duties."], ["[22]", "A hearing with respect to Mr. Hinzman's conscientious objector application was held in Kandahar on April 2, 2003. Mr. Hinzman has complained that he was unable to call any witnesses at the hearing because the hearing was held in Afghanistan, and the witnesses that he might have called, including his wife and the Quakers with whom he had attended meetings, were all in the United States. However, although Army Regulation 600-43, which governs conscientious objector procedures, expressly contemplates the adjournment of hearings for good cause at the request of the applicant, Mr. Hinzman never sought to have the hearing adjourned until his return to the United States so as to permit him to call witnesses."], ["[23]", "After the hearing, the First Lieutenant assigned to hear the case concluded that while Mr. Hinzman sincerely opposed war on a philosophical, societal and intellectual level, his beliefs were not congruent with the definition of conscientious objector set out in the Army regulations. In coming to this conclusion, the First Lieutenant appears to have been influenced by the fact that while Mr. Hinzman was unwilling to participate in offensive combat operations, he was prepared to participate in defensive operations. The First Lieutenant concluded that Mr. Hinzman could not choose when or where he would fight and, as a result, his application was denied."], ["[24]", "The First Lieutenant also found that Mr. Hinzman was using his conscientious objector application as a way to try to get out of the Infantry. This conclusion was based, in part, on a negative, and apparently erroneous, inference drawn from the First Lieutenant's belief that Mr. Hinzman had not claimed conscientious objector status until shortly after he found out that he was to be sent to Afghanistan."], ["[25]", "Although there is a right of appeal from a negative first-level decision, Mr. Hinzman did not appeal the First Lieutenant's decision, nor did he take any steps to investigate his rights in this regard. He continued to perform kitchen work for the remainder of his deployment in Afghanistan, and upon his return to the United States in July of 2003, Mr. Hinzman resumed his normal duties as an Infantryman."], ["[26]", "Mr. Hinzman testified that he did not pursue his claim for conscientious objector status on his return to the States because he was \"worn out\", and because he felt that there would be no point to pursuing the matter. He also testified that he did not want to go through another long process of waiting, and did not want to have to do menial tasks while a decision was pending."], ["[27]", "He also stated that while he was still in Afghanistan, he began thinking about the fact that he could be deployed to fight in Iraq, and that he resolved at that time that he would not go. At his refugee hearing, Mr. Hinzman was asked why, if that was the case, did he not desert upon his return from Afghanistan. He said that once he returned to the States, he was back with his family and the thought of deserting had simply not occurred to him, even though by this point he knew that it was inevitable that he would be sent to Iraq."], ["[28]", "Mr. Hinzman says that he decided not to fight in Iraq because, in his view, the American military action in that country was illegal. He based this opinion on the fact that even though Iraq was supposed to be in possession of weapons of mass destruction, after months of investigation, no such weapons had been uncovered. Similarly, no links to terrorist organizations had been established, even though these ostensible links had been offered as a pretext for the United States going into Iraq. Finally, given his belief that Iraq posed no threat to the United States, Mr. Hinzman was of the view that there was no justification for such a non-defensive incursion into foreign territory."], ["[29]", "In December of 2003, Mr. Hinzman was told that his unit was to be deployed to Iraq on January 16, 2004. Having resolved not to go, Mr. Hinzman had two options - he could refuse the order to deploy, or he could desert. If he chose to refuse the deployment order, Mr. Hinzman could have been prosecuted under the Universal Code of Military Justice. Instead, he opted to desert."], ["[30]", "Mr. Hinzman arrived in Canada with his family on January 4, 2004, and the family filed their applications for refugee status some three weeks later. Their applications were based on Mr. Hinzman's political beliefs. In his Personal Information Form (or \"PIF\"), Mr. Hinzman describes his reasons for deserting in the following terms:", "\"The war with Iraq was the immediate reason for my decision to refuse military duty in its entirety. First, I feel that the war is contrary to international law and waged on false pretenses. Second, I am not willing to kill or be killed in the service of ideology and economic gain.\""], ["[31]", "Mr. Hinzman further claimed that participating in the war in Iraq would violate both his conscience and his religious principles, although his refugee claim was based only upon his political opinion."], ["[32]", "Mr. Hinzman says that because the military occupation of Iraq was without a proper legal foundation, he would be a criminal if he were to take part in it. At the same time, however, he acknowledged that he would have been prepared to serve in Iraq in a non-combatant role, even though he was of the view that this limited participation would still make him complicit in an illegal war."], ["[33]", "If he were returned to the United States, Mr. Hinzman says that he would be prosecuted for desertion. While acknowledging that the vast majority of military deserters merely receive a dishonourable discharge from the military, and are not prosecuted, Mr. Hinzman is of the view that he has \"ruffled enough feathers\" that he would probably be court-martialled, and would likely receive a sentence of anywhere from one to five years in a military prison."], ["[34]", "While Mr. Hinzman acknowledges that he would receive a fair trial in the United States, before an independent judiciary, he nonetheless asserts that any form of punishment that he would incur for merely following his conscience would amount to persecution.", "III. The Board's Preliminary Evidentiary Ruling"], ["[35]", "In the pre-hearing process leading up to the hearing of the applicants' refugee claims, counsel for the applicants indicated that he intended to lead evidence at the hearing as to the alleged illegality of the American military action in Iraq."], ["[36]", "This evidence primarily took the form of affidavits from two professors of international law, both of whom focused on the lack of United Nations Security Council approval for the American government's use of force in Iraq. Both professors observe that the", "Charter of the United Nations", ", 26 June 1945, Can T.S. 1945 No. 7 (", "UN Charter", "), permits the use of force by one country against another in only two situations: in cases of self-defense, and where there is Security Council approval."], ["[37]", "Both professors observe that the United States did not invoke self-defense as a legal justification for its military intervention in Iraq. They further argue that none of the Security Council resolutions relied upon by the United States to justify its conduct condoned military action against Iraq in the present circumstances. The professors specifically refer to Security Council Resolution 1441, which recognizes further breaches by Iraq of its disarmament obligations, and requires that any further non-compliance be reported to the Security Council for reassessment. Although this Resolution does not expressly contemplate the need for an additional resolution authorizing force, the professors argue that, given the deep disagreements that led to the adoption of this compromise Resolution, it is impossible to read the Resolution as either an express or implied authority for the use of force."], ["[38]", "One of the professors also discusses a developing view of humanitarian intervention as a third possible justification for one State to use armed force against another. However, the professor observes that President Bush made no attempt to justify the American invasion of Iraq as a humanitarian intervention."], ["[39]", "Both professors conclude that, in the absence of either Security Council approval or a sound case for self-defense, no legal justification exists for the war in Iraq. As a consequence, each concludes that the American invasion of Iraq was carried out in violation of the prohibition on the use of force enshrined in Article 2(4) of the", "UN Charter", ", and was thus illegal."], ["[40]", "The other evidence which the applicants sought to adduce was to a similar effect."], ["[41]", "The Board decided to address the admissibility of this evidence in advance of the hearing, receiving submissions on the following question:", "\"...

This application for judicial review is dismissed.", "2.

In countries where military service is compulsory, failure to perform this duty is frequently punishable by law. Moreover whether military service is compulsory or not, desertion is invariably considered a criminal offence. The penalties may vary from country to country, and are not normally regarded as persecution. Fear of prosecution and punishment for desertion or draft-evasion does not in itself constitute well-founded fear of persecution under the definition. Desertion or draft evasion does not, on the other hand, exclude a person from being a refugee, and the person may be a refugee in addition to being a deserter or draft-evader.", "\"168. The person is clearly not a refugee if his only reason for desertion or draft-evasion is his dislike of military service or fear of combat. He may, however, be a refugee if his desertion or evasion of military service is concomitant with other relevant motives for leaving or remaining outside his country, or if he otherwise has reasons within the meaning of the definition, to fear persecution.", "\"169. A deserter or draft-evader may also be considered a refugee if it can be shown that he would suffer disproportionately severe punishment for the military offence on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The same would apply if it could be shown that he has a well-founded fear of persecution on these grounds above and beyond the punishment for desertion.", "\"170. There are, however, also cases where the necessity to perform military service may be the sole ground for a claim to refugee status, i.e. when a person can show that the performance of military service would have required his participation in military action contrary to his genuine political, religious or moral convictions, or to valid reasons of conscience.", "\"171. Not every conviction, genuine though it may be, will constitute a sufficient reason for claiming refugee status after desertion or draft-evasion. It is not enough for a person to be in disagreement with his government regarding the political justification for a particular military action. Where, however, the type of military action, with which an individual does not wish to be associated, is condemned by the international community as contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, punishment for desertion or draft evasion could, in the light of all other requirements of the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution.", "\"172. Refusal to perform military service may also be based on religious convictions. If an applicant is able to show that his religious convictions are genuine, and that such convictions are not taken into account by the authorities of his country in requiring him to perform military service, he may be able to establish a claim to refugee status. Such a claim would, of course, be supported by any additional indications that the applicant or his family may have encountered difficulties due to their religious convictions.", "\"173. The question as to whether objection to performing military service for reasons of conscience can give rise to a valid claim to refugee status should also be considered in light of more recent developments in this field. An increasing number of States have introduced legislation or administrative regulations whereby persons who can invoke genuine reasons of conscience are exempted from military service, either entirely or subject to their performing alternative (ie: civilian) service. The introduction of such legislation or administrative regulations has also been the subject of recommendations by international agencies. In light of these developments, it would be open to Contracting States to grant refugee status to persons who object to performing military service for genuine reasons of conscience.", "\"174. The genuineness of a person's political, religious or moral convictions, or of his reasons of conscience for objecting to performing military service, will of course need to be established by a thorough investigation of his personality and background. The fact that he may have manifested his views prior to being called to arms, or that he may have already encountered difficulties with the authorities because of his convictions, are relevant considerations. Whether he has been drafted into compulsory service or joined the army as a volunteer may also be indicative of the genuineness of his convictions.\"", "[End of document]"]]}

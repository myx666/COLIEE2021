Certain portions of the 2004 report are very critical of the Mexican government. In particular, it is indicated that corruption is widespread in the Mexican police and exists to a lesser extent in the army. Murders and kidnappings of individuals are common and are a real problem; according to an unofficial figure, 3,000 kidnappings occur annually. Further, the police is at times involved in kidnappings, armed robberies, acts of extortion and the protection of criminals and drug traffickers. Several suspects are not charged or are released after paying bribes. The Mexican police are also reproached with torturing suspects to obtain confessions. Further, the courts continue to admit in evidence statements obtained under torture. Even though the Mexican government has taken punitive measures against the police or members of the army, impunity remains a problem. Despite the reforms undertaken in the judiciary, the long delays, the absence of due process, judicial incompetence and corruption persist. Indeed, because of these problems, many victims fear filing complaints against the police. The fact is that police officers suspected of corruption are not often prosecuted. In short, a number of individuals have no confidence in the legal system and are very hesitant to file official complaints: see U.S., U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor,", "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2004: Mexico", "(February 28, 2005).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "The applicant further argued that a majority of crimes are not reported in Mexico simply because people do not trust the police and fear reprisals if they report criminals.

Thus, in one of the documents not mentioned by the Board in its decision, the crime rate for crimes under the law of the several Mexican states is said to have diminished by 1% while federal crimes allegedly increased by 1%.

According to various estimates, the proportion of unreported crimes, sometimes referred to as the (Translation) \"black number\" (", "la cifra negra", ") is between 75% and 80%, which would mean that only one crime in four or five is reported to the police: see Canada, Research Directorate, Immigration and Refugee Board,", "Mexico: State Protection (December 2003 - March 2005)", ", Ottawa, 2005, at pages 22-23.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The applicant also challenged the reasonableness of the finding by the Board that \"if he had no success [with the police], he could have appealed to the CNDH [National Human Rights Commission] and the CEDH [Government Human Rights Commission], which investigate complaints\".

Here, the persecuting agent was a political organizer for the PRI, the party which was in power in Mexico for 70 years. The applicant was already threatened, kidnapped and beaten by members of the DOTS. The applicant stated that attempts were also made to set the family home on fire: two neighbours saw two young people he rightly suspected of being thugs employed by the persecuting agent throw a cracker at the wall of the family home.

In order to rebut the presumption that a state can protect its nationals, a claimant may put before the Board testimony of similarly situated individuals. He can also rely on the documentary evidence of record. He can, of course, relate his own experience (", "Ward", ", supra, at paragraphs 49, 50 and 52).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "In order to determine whether a refugee protection claimant has discharged his burden of proof, the Board must undertake a proper analysis of the situation in the country and the particular reasons why the protection claimant submits that he is \"unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail [himself] of the protection\" of his country of nationality or habitual residence (paragraphs 96(a) and (b) and subparagraph 97(1)(b)(i) of the", "Act", "). The Board must consider not only whether the state is actually capable of providing protection but also whether it is willing to act.

Nonetheless, though government protection does not have to be perfect, some protection must exist the minimum level of which does not have to be determined by the Court. The Board may in the circumstances determine that the protection provided by the state is adequate, with reference to standards defined in international instruments, and what the citizens of a democratic country may legitimately expect in such cases. In my opinion, this is a question of fact which does not have to be answered in absolute terms. Each case is sui generis. For example, in the case of Mexico, one must look not only at the protection existing at the federal level, but also at the state level. Before examining the question of protection, the Board must of course be clear as to the nature of the fear of persecution or risk alleged by the applicant. When, as in this case, the applicant fears the persecution of a person who is not an agent of the state, the Board must inter alia examine the motivation of the persecuting agent and his ability to go after the applicant locally or throughout the country, which may raise the question of the existence of internal refuge and its reasonableness (at least in connection with the analysis conducted under s. 96 of the", "Act", ").  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "Accordingly, when the government is not the persecuting agent, and even when it is a democratic state, it is still open to an applicant to adduce evidence showing clearly and convincingly that it is unable or does not really wish to protect its nationals in certain types of situation: see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 121 F.T.R. 81 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 175 F.T.R. 116 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).

Once it is established that a country (in that case Israel) has judicial and political institutions capable of protecting its nationals, from the refusal of certain police officers to intervene, it cannot by ipso facto inferred that the state is unable to do so. It is on this account that the Federal Court of Appeal mentioned obiter that the burden of proof on the claimant is to some extent directly proportional to the \"degree of democracy\" of the national’s country. The degree of democracy is not necessarily the same from one country to another. Therefore, it would be an error of law to adopt a \"systemic\" approach as to the protection offered to the nationals of a given country. This is what is likely to happen when the reasons for dismissal given by the Board are too general and may apply equally to another country or another claimant (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "Whether the issue be the best interest of the democratic state in question and of civil society in general, or the individual interest of the victim or perpetrator of an alleged criminal offence, the payment of a monetary or other benefit of any kind to a police or law officer is illegal.

Due process of law and equality before the law are the vital strength of any democracy and create a legitimate expectation in individuals that the state will do what is necessary to go after criminals and bring them to justice, and if necessary to stamp out corruption. The independence and impartiality of the judiciary and its components are not negotiable. These are fundamental values in any country which claims to be a true democracy. Therefore, the degree to which a state tolerates corruption in the political or judicial apparatus correspondingly diminishes its degree of democracy. That being said, I do not have to decide here whether the documentary evidence established, as the applicant vigorously claimed, such a degree of corruption that it can be said it was not unreasonable in the circumstances for the applicant not to approach the police of his country before seeking international protection. Due to its special expertise and its knowledge of the general conditions prevailing in a given country, the Board is in a much better position than this Court to answer such a question.

No. 1923, at paragraphs 30-34.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[37]", "All these errors make the decision unreasonable; therefore, it should be quashed by this Court, and the applicant’s case should be referred back to the Board for re-hearing and re-determination by another member.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[38]", "This application must therefore be allowed. Counsel suggested no question of general importance for certification.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "ORDER  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[39]", "THE COURT ALLOWS", "the application for judicial review, sets aside the decision of June 8, 2005 and refers the applicant’s case back to the Board for re-hearing and re-determination by another member. No question of general importance will be certified by the Court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Application allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Editor: Angela E. McKay/gs  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"]]}

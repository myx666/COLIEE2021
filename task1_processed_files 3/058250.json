Given the aforementioned, you have not been assigned any points for this job offered to you.\"", "The visa officer's decision makes no mention of the applicant's aptitudes and it is this omission that applicant's counsel says is critical because it is aptitude that should be used to determine whether the applicant could reasonably be expected to acquire, within a reasonable time, the skill required for the job. Even assuming that the visa officer failed to take into account the applicant's aptitudes, however, I do not think that the result of the assessment would have been different. The visa officer was obliged to consider the applicant's work experience as well as aptitudes. She was obliged to attach some weight to the experience factor. In terms of the assessment of units, some number of the maximum 10 units available would have to be attributed to experience. Her finding that the applicant did not have the experience to fulfil the duties required of him in Canada would require that she deduct from the maximum 10 units available, some number of units. Since the applicant required all 10 units to meet the eligibility standard, i.e. 55, it is obvious that his lack of experience alone would result in him not meeting the standard, even if he scored strongly in respect to aptitude."], ["[11]", "However, it is apparent from the computer notes of the respondent that the visa officer did take the applicant's aptitude into account. The notes state in part:", "\"Although pi has been a kitchen helper for a few years ... he has never gone on to get his grade III cooking cert.\"", "The visa officer's notes indicate that in her opinion, the applicant had limited initiative in that he had never even sought to upgrade his fourth grade cook qualification in China. The job in Canada would require the applicant to do some management functions such as scheduling staff and maintaining employee time records. Further, the father's letter states that a high degree of initiative and flexibility is required. Certainly, having these requirements in mind, the applicant's lack of initiative seems to be demonstrated by his failure to upgrade his job qualifications in China. These are considerations with respect to aptitude and are matters that can be considered forward looking."], ["[12]", "While the visa officer should have been more explicit in her decision, I think it is implicit in her reference to the applicant's lack of skill and experience, in the context of his failure to upgrade his qualifications in China, that she did consider the question of aptitude and that her decision was forward looking. In my view, the visa officer did not fetter her discretion or otherwise err in law in this respect."], ["[13]", "There is then the question of the number of units the applicant was actually awarded. The decision itself is clear. The applicant was only awarded 45 units, 10 less than the required minimum. However the computer notes of the respondent indicate that \"bonus units\" were also awarded to the applicant. With bonus units the applicant would have achieved a score of 60. While the record is not clear as to why bonus units are awarded, the computer notes do indicate that they have no bearing on the applicant's assessment for immigration purposes. Counsel for the respondent explained that the bonus units may refer to a different scale of units utilized in a computer program and that had the bonus units been included in the applicant's assessment the required number of units would also have been higher and he still would not have met the required minimum. This explanation seems to be borne out by the computer notes. In any event, the decision itself is clear that the applicant did not achieve the 55 units required. The computer notes do not indicate anything to the contrary, that is, that the applicant did meet or exceed the required minimum. I am satisfied the applicant did not meet the required minimum. While the computer notes are not as clear as might be desirable, it must be remembered that they are internal notes intended for persons knowledgeable about the subject area and assessment of units. They are not incoherent in the sense that the court might have a concern that the applicant, according to someone's assessment of units, might have qualified for immigration according to the points required for an assisted relative. There is no basis for not accepting the visa officer's decision for this reason."], ["[14]", "The application for judicial review must be dismissed."], ["[15]", "Counsel for the applicant submitted that I should certify a serious question of general importance, which I would state as follows:", "\"In awarding units in respect of factor 5 of Schedule I of the", "Immigration Regulations", ", 1978 or s. 1.35(1) of the", "Immigration Manual", "(assuming it has the force of law) must a visa officer award either zero or 10 units on the one hand or is there discretion to award any number of units from zero to 10 on the other?\"", "Application dismissed.", "Editor: Steven C.

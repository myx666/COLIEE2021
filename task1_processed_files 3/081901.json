The Secretary was impressed with the performance and recommended them to the Executive Committee of the Nanaksar Satsang Sabha of Ontario. Following this, they were then invited to work at the Nanaksar Satsang Sabha Gurdwara (Sikh temple) in Brampton (the Brampton Gurdwara).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The Brampton Gurdwara is part of an international chain of Gurdwaras. The headquarters is in New Delhi where the applicants currently work.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The Brampton Gurdwara obtained a positive labour market opinion (LMO) in June 2009 for four Ragi positions each at a salary of $36,000 per year plus lodging and other expenses.

By not doing so, the officer put the applicants in a position where they could not satisfy her of their experience regardless of whether they provided the documentation requested by CIC.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "The applicants also provided detailed descriptions during their interview about their training, experience as Ragis, the daily routine at the Gurdwara, their musical skills and information about their religion. Yet, the officer concluded that all three applicants did not meet the job requirements and had insufficient knowledge of the religions and its teachings. The applicants submit that this demonstrates that the officer did not consider the information the applicants provided during their interview in reaching her decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "The applicants submit that the officer erred by not giving any weight to the assessment by a previous officer who noted each applicant's experience as a Ragi and stated that the applicants met the Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) requirements.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "The applicants submit that it was unreasonable for the officer to find their responses inconsistent. Any differences between their answers were small and may be attributed to the different roles they played in the services. Their correct answers were consistent with the job offer and are evidence of their credibility and experience as Ragis and they should not be penalized for not knowing the size of the congregation in Canada. The officer unreasonably concluded that they lacked sufficient knowledge of the job in Canada as she did not consider the information they each provided in the interview.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "The applicants submit that they would receive a salary of $36,000 to cover living expenses and although they did not explain that they would donate any excess above living costs to charity, there is nothing to suggest the salary was incentive for the applicants to stay in Canada unlawfully. The negative finding regarding the salary was unsupported and led to the assessment of the", "bona fides", "of the applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "The applicants submit that the officer failed to apply the principle of dual intent of subsection 22(2) of the Act. The applicants were permitted to have the intention of becoming permanent residents as long as they returned to India at the end of the authorized stay. The applicants provided sufficient evidence of ties to India to show that they would not stay in Canada beyond the authorized period. In particular, Paramjit Singh provided evidence of his previous travel to and return from Kenya, not considered by the officer, which is further evidence that he would not overstay the temporary work permit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "While the officer has acknowledged that her handwritten comments about the lack of knowledge of the religion were erroneous, it is improbable that these reasons did not form part of her actual reasons for refusal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "The applicants submit that the officer is improperly using her affidavit to improve upon her reasons and her affidavit should not be given any weight. For example, they submit that the officer did not indicate concerns with credibility in the refusal letter or the interview but now states that her decision focused around the applicants' lack of credibility. In addition, her reasons in the refusal letter should be taken at face value since they were entered closer in time to the decision than the new affidavit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "The applicants submit that the numerous significant errors and inconsistencies in the officer's CAIPS notes and affidavit have caused significant delay and hardship to the applicants and they should be awarded costs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Respondent's Written Submissions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "The respondent submits that the fact that the officer was not convinced by the letters of experience does not mean she did not consider them. She was only required to acknowledge evidence before her which was relatively significant. Since the officer sees many of these letters which are fictitious, it was reasonable for her to require more than just the letters as evidence of experience. The officer did not refer to these letters because reviewing letters such as these is a routine part of her job.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "The respondent submits that an assessment by a previous officer based on the LMO cannot be used as evidence of the applicants' experience because the LMO assumes the truth of all information in the applicants' applications and the officer's assessment merely acknowledges that the training and experience satisfy the HRSDC requirements. The officer deciding the visa application must make her own assessment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "The respondent submits that the inconsistent answers of the Ragis raised serious concerns for the officer as to whether they were a group. The inconsistencies were not small. Getting some answers correct about the prospective employer does not cancel out the applicants' wrong answers, especially when they are substantial in nature.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "The respondent acknowledges that the handwritten statement that the applicants lacked religious knowledge was erroneous. However, the respondent submits that this is not fatal to the decision because the decision was wholly based on other concerns: the inconsistent answers, lack of basic knowledge about the employer, the serious breach of faith made by accepting a salary above and beyond the living expenses.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[32]", "The respondent submits that the non-credibility finding was reasonable. The applicants admitted that the salary went against their ethical obligations and never indicated that they would give the remainder to charity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[33]", "The officer's finding that the applicants were using the work program to facilitate access to Canada should be read as using the program to facilitate unlawful entry to Canada which was part of her position to assess and was not ignoring the principle of dual intent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[34]", "The respondent submits that the applicants have not raised any reviewable errors as none of the findings were unreasonable and the officer did not infringe on the applicants' right to enter Canada with dual intent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Analysis and Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[35]", "Issue 1  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "What is the appropriate standard of review?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Refusal of a temporary work permit is an administrative decision made within the officer's legislative authority and is ostensibly a determination of fact (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).

In a nutshell, the Panel's decision was based on findings concerning the availability of state protection in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines which were selective and unreasonable in the particular circumstances of this case.", "Background"], ["[3]", "The Applicant is a female citizen of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines born on September 29, 1986. She formerly resided with her mother and her mother's common-law spouse on Union Island, a small island south of the archipelago. She has no immediate family members other than her mother. Her mother's common law spouse (referred to herein as the \"stepfather\") was an abusive alcoholic."], ["[4]", "When the Applicant was 12 years old, her stepfather sexually assaulted her. He continued abusing her sexually until her departure from Union Island when she was 17. The Applicant's mother found out about this abuse and attempted to stop it, but the stepfather threatened to kill both the Applicant and her mother if any of them said anything to anyone about the abuse. The Applicant's mother thus arranged for the Applicant to come to Canada in order to escape this abuse. Canada was the only foreign country where the Applicant's mother knew someone who could take care of the Applicant outside of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines."], ["[5]", "The Applicant thus arrived in Canada on August 18, 2003 at the age of 17, sent here by her mother to avoid the continued sexual abuse at the hands of her stepfather. She had to leave school to come to Canada and has only completed part of her secondary education. She hid with her mother's friend for a few years and supported herself by babysitting."], ["[6]", "The Applicant was initially unaware of the possibility of claiming refugee status since her mother's friend was herself unaware of the intricacies of Canada's immigration and refugee protection laws. The Applicant subsequently became pregnant and gave birth to her child. Since she could no longer stay with her mother's friend, she had to go to a shelter with her child on February 11, 2007. Learning of her story, the shelter workers informed her she could claim protection in Canada. She thus voluntarily reported to immigration authorities on February 19, 2007 to make a refugee claim.", "The impugned decision"], ["[7]", "The Panel did not directly dispute the Applicant's story, but had some credibility concerns relating to the Applicant's assertions that she had not had any direct contact with her mother since her arrival in Canada and that she was unaware of the availability of refugee protection until informed of such by the shelter workers. These concerns were however not central to the Applicant's claim."], ["[8]", "Consequently, the Panel rejected the refugee claim on the basis of the availability of state protection for the Applicant in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The Panel's decision on the availability of state protection will be more fully reviewed below. Suffice it to note that the Panel considered that the Applicant (then a minor) had made insufficient efforts to obtain state protection when she was subject to sexual abuse from her stepfather. Further, the Panel found that now that the Applicant was an adult, she could safely return to Saint-Vincent and the Grenadines. Though the Panel recognized that violence against women is a serious problem in that country, it found that existing and proposed laws provided protection against gender-based abuse and rape.", "Position of the Applicant"], ["[9]", "The Applicant strongly objects to the credibility concerns of the Panel, but notes that these concerns were not central to her claim. The thrust of the Applicant's challenge is thus based on the Panel's deficient analysis of the availability of state protection in the particular circumstances in which the Applicant finds herself."], ["[10]", "The Applicant submits that for a state protection analysis to be deemed reasonable, the Panel has to acknowledge and explain why negative evidence on the availability of such protection in gender claims is rejected or deemed irrelevant. The Panel here failed to carry out such an analysis. On the contrary, the Panel was exceedingly selective and ignored strong evidence of the unavailability of state protection. The Applicant's counsel provided this Court with many cogent examples of selectiveness and deficient analysis of which more shall be said below."], ["[11]", "The Applicant also argues that the Panel completely disregarded her personal circumstances in the state protection analysis. She is an only child who has little or no prospect of employment in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and who must care for her young daughter. If she is returned to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, there is a very strong likelihood that her only option will be to return to live with her mother and her abusive stepfather, thus placing her and her own daughter at risk of abuse. The Applicant asserts that the Panel unreasonably ignored these circumstances in reaching its decision.", "Position of the Respondent"], ["[12]", "The Respondent acknowledges that the determinative element of the Panel's decision is its finding concerning the availability of state protection. The Panel properly noted that the Applicant had not sought state protection in Saint Vincent when she was being abused by her stepfather, and thus did not provide clear and convincing evidence that the authorities were unable or unwilling to protect her at that time. This was a reasonable finding according to the Respondent."], ["[13]", "Moreover, the Respondent asserts that the Panel reasonably found that adequate state protection is currently available to the Applicant. The Panel reasonably found that given her current age, the Applicant should not have to live with and depend on her mother and stepfather if she were to return to Saint Vincent. Accordingly, the Panel found that the Applicant could approach authorities on her own and receive adequate protection. The test for the availability of state protection is adequacy and not effectiveness.", "Pertinent legislative provisions"], ["[14]", "The pertinent provision of the Act for the purposes of this judicial review is subparagraph 97(1)(b)(i) which reads as follows:", "97.", "(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally", "[...]", ") to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if", "(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,", "[...]", "97.", "(1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:", "[...]", "b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:", "(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,", "[...]", "Standard of review"], ["[15]", "As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (\" <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \") at paras. 54, 57 and 62, the first step in ascertaining the appropriate standard of review is to ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question."], ["[16]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.

This was, in my considered opinion, unreasonable. To impose on a sexually molested child an obligation to seek protection from state authorities where her mother herself does not is, to say the least, disturbing. Consequently, I find no merit in the Panel's decision imposing such a burden on the Applicant in order to refute the presumption of the availability of state protection."], ["[19]", "Concerning the Panel's conclusion on the availability of state protection now that the Applicant is an adult, I find that the evidence considered by the Panel was selective and inadequately analyzed, leading to the conclusion that the Panel's finding on the availability of state protection in this specific case was unreasonable. A few examples are in order to explain my conclusion in this regard."], ["[20]", "At paragraph 19 of its decision, the Panel notes, based on \"Response to Information Request VCT102962.E\", that \"police officers in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are trained to handle cases of domestic violence. An emphasis is placed on filing a report and initiating court proceedings if there is sufficient evidence.\" However, this same document VCT102962.E adds the following with respect to the effectiveness of the police in handling cases of domestic violence (at page 59 of the certified tribunal record):", "With respect to the effectiveness of the police in handling of cases of domestic violence in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a representative of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Human Rights Association (SVGHRA) provided the following information in 7 November 2008 correspondence to the Research Directorate:", "Most police officers have limited knowledge and skills on domestic and family violence, inclusive of procedures, but a selective few treat the issue with seriousness. Trained officers receive general training in policing which they apply in domestic and family violence incidences and which lead to complications for the victim, who feels further victimized.", "In addition, when female victims go to make reports, they are served by gross, disrespectful, chauvinistic, young male officers who feel the victim asked for what she received. There are no specialized kits either. In most cases, the male police officers become impatient if the victim is hesitant in responding to questions.", "Generally, the attitude of police officers, the open area for questioning and the overall ineffectiveness of the police and court, make the victim reluctant to testify.", "Although a limited number of sensitive police officers try their utmost to facilitate and make the victim comfortable, when the matter gets to the court, the victim often withdraws as she is in most cases dependent on the perpetrator. The lengthy court process too also frustrates the victim.", "If there is a protection order, the victim often feels unprotected as the absence of shelters makes the document merely an empty academic order. [...]", "The Panel makes no mention of this in its decision and never explains why it has not taken this information into account or otherwise discarded it."], ["[21]", "The Panel further asserts at paragraph 19 of its decision that \"[u] nder subsection 5(2) of the 1995 Domestic Violence Act when a protection order is in force, a police officer may arrest without a warrant a person whom he has reasonable cause to suspect of having committed a breach of the order\". The Panel bases this finding on \"Response to Information Request VCT102939.E\".

The Applicant here is a victim of sexual violence."], ["[23]", "At paragraph 22 of its decision, the Panel notes, based on \"Response to information Request VCT100481.FE\" that \"the authorities recently purchased a building that, once renovated, will serve as a shelter for battered women\" without explaining how a shelter which does not yet exist would be of any use to the Applicant.

However, Ms. Lewis claims that the Board failed to refer to the evidence showing the limited capacity of the Family Court to enforce its orders, the reluctance of police officers to take action in domestic violence cases, and the infrequency with which the laws that are supposed to protect women are enforced.", "The Minister argues that the Board is presumed to have considered all the evidence before it, even if the Board does not specifically cite it.

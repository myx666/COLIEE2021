The principal applicant, Munawar Sultana, is married to a Canadian citizen, Muhamman Arif, with whom she has three children who are the other applicants.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "Mr. Arif applied to immigrate to Canada in January 1998, when he was not yet married. He married the principal applicant in November 1998, and they had their first child in September 1999. One year and eight months after submitting his application for permanent resident status, in September 1999, he was invited for an in-person interview at the visa office in Islamabad. By that time, he was married to and had a son with Mrs. Munawar Sultana.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "Mr. Arif says that he was advised by an immigration consultant not to mention his wife or son, as it would be simpler and faster to sponsor them after landing in Canada. He was apparently further advised that he could sponsor his wife and son after landing in Canada. Mr. Arif followed that advice and did not disclose their existence at the interview or upon landing in September 2000. The other two children were born after Mr. Arif landed in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "In 2002, the new", "Immigration and Refugee Protection", "Act", ", S.C. 2001, c. 27 (", "IRPA", ") was enacted. It required all permanent residents to apply for and obtain a Permanent Resident card. The new", "Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations", ", SOR/2002-227 (the", "Regulations", ") also came into effect and s. 117(9)(d) mandated that a Canadian permanent resident or citizen could not sponsor family members who were \"non-accompanying\" at the time the sponsor became a permanent resident and were \"not examined\". The sponsor applied for a Permanent Resident card and listed all of his family members in Pakistan. The card was issued to him.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "As suggested by his immigration advisor in Pakistan, the applicant's husband filed his first application to sponsor his wife and three children in January 2006. This was done without counsel. That application was returned to him as he had not listed his wife and first son in his permanent residence application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "Mr. Arif then applied for citizenship, listing all of his family members, and became a citizen in 2006. He then applied to sponsor his family a second time, with the assistance of counsel, requesting that humanitarian and compassionate consideration be given to his case pursuant to s. 25 of the", "IRPA", ". This is the application that is the subject of the current judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "It bears mentioning that Mr. Arif, despite his best efforts, could not find work in the electrical engineering field for which he was educated and trained. He became a taxi driver and eventually became well-settled in that position.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The Impugned Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "By letter dated July 28, 2008, the applicant was informed that the requirements for permanent residence in the family class were not met. Since Mr. Arif had not declared the principal applicant in his application for permanent residence, she was determined not to be a member of the family class pursuant to s. 117 (9)(d) of the", "Regulations", ". The Immigration officer then went on to state that s. 25 of the", "IRPA", "had been considered and that, after a balancing of H&C factors and the nature of the exclusion, H&C considerations did not justify granting an exemption. As such, the exemption was refused.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "To have a proper understanding of the decision, one has to look at the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes, wherein the Immigration officer made the following observations. First, he found that the marriage appears to be genuine based on the documentation filed. The Immigration officer then considered the H&C factors raised by the applicants. He dismissed the explanations for withholding material information, because he found that the applicant knowingly withheld the information about the change in his marital status and the birth of his child so as to avoid delay. The Immigration officer noted that \"by the time [the sponsor] was called in for an interview, [he] had been married and [his first son] had been born\". Also, he noted that the sponsor took the advice of an immigration consultant and chose not to declare his family members, as he did not want to slow down the processing of his application. The Immigration officer rejected this explanation, on the ground that it is an applicant's responsibility to ensure that the information provided in an application and during an interview is correct and truthful, and because ignorance of the law and low language proficiency are not reasons for withholding material information as the onus is on an applicant to take responsibility for his/her application and all of the information contained therein.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The Immigration officer then considered the impact of separation on the sponsor. He took note of the sponsor's difficulties at work, including the car accidents that the sponsor alleges are related to the separation from his family. The Immigration officer noted that proof of the accidents had not been submitted. Further, there was \"no evidence to conclusively link any such accidents directly to the separation\". The Immigration officer also assessed the psychologist's report, indicating that, in her opinion, the sponsor was suffering from major depressive disorder, moderate severity\". However, the Immigration officer noted that the only recommended action specified was family reunification and that there was \"no treatment plan outlined, no medications nor other remedies ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "The Immigration officer also considered the impact on the principal applicant, and found that it did not warrant granting an H&C exemption. The Immigration officer noted that although the sponsor had visited his family on two occasions, in 2004 and 2006, and that money transfer receipts from 2004 and 2005 were submitted, there was no conclusive proof of \"recent, continued and regular contact\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "With respect to the best interests of the child, the Immigration officer took note of their ages, which were 8, 7 and 4 years at the time of the decision. He also noted that the sponsor sends money to support the principal applicant and their children and has visited the family, for fairly lengthy durations each time. He nevertheless found that the sponsor was free to continue to visit his family as he had previously done, and also indicated that the principal applicant has five siblings and in laws to whom she and her children could turn for emotional and other support.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "The Immigration officer then concludes that he was not satisfied that the marital status was not intentionally withheld from both the visa office and the Port of Entry. In his view, there were not sufficient reasons to justify overturning the s. 117(9)(d) finding on H&C grounds.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "It is worth mentioning that Mr. Arif appealed this decision to the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the IAD). The appeal was dismissed without a hearing on February 4, 2009, on the ground that the IAD has no discretionary jurisdiction to consider humanitarian and compassionate considerations. Relying on s. 65 of the", "IRPA", "and on the jurisprudence from this Court (most notably", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), the IAD ruled that the proper forum in which to challenge a s. 25 H&C decision by the Minister is to seek judicial review of that decision by the Federal Court. This was clearly the right decision to make.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "The applicants have raised three issues in the context of their application for judicial review:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "a. Did the Immigration officer err in his interpretation and application of s. 25 of the", "IRPA", "in cases involving s. 117(9)(d) of the", "Regulations", "?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "b. Did the Immigration officer fail to adequately address the best interests of the child?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "c. Did the Immigration officer make perverse and capricious findings in disregard to the evidence or make findings without evidence?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "There is no dispute between the parties, nor could there be, that the appropriate standard of review in assessing the questions raised by the applicants is the reasonableness standard. The Supreme Court of Canada determined that this is the standard to be applied to decisions based on H&C grounds made from within  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 62. This Court has repeatedly applied that same standard for H&C applications made from outside of Canada: see, for ex.,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 14;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 12;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 8. These decisions are clearly discretionary and fact heavy, and deserve a high degree of deference from this Court. Accordingly, the decision must be upheld unless it does not fall within \"a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\":", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 47);", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 59.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "Before turning to the specific questions raised by the applicants, it is helpful to canvass briefly the legal framework within which the decision was made. The", "IRPA", "and the", "Regulations", "create a \"family class\" for the purpose of selecting foreign nationals who may become permanent residents in Canada. The intent of the family class program is to facilitate the reunion in Canada of Canadian citizens and permanent residents with their close relatives and family members. Foreign nationals who apply as members of the \"family class\" for permanent residence visas are given preferential treatment under Canadian immigration law and policy. For example, their applications are processed, as a matter of policy, on a priority basis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "Section 117 of the", "Regulations", "defines who is a member of the \"family class\". Section 117(1) provides that a foreign national is a member of the family class if the foreign national is a spouse or dependent child of the sponsor.

At the time relevant to the within proceeding, s. 117(9)(d) provided as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"117(9) A foreign national shall not be considered a member of the family class by virtue of their relationship to a sponsor if  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ". . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(d) subject to subsection (10), the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor and was not examined. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"(9) Ne sont pas considérées comme appartenant à la catégorie du regroupement familial du fait de leur relation avec le répondant les personnes suivantes:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ". . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "d) sous réserve du paragraphe (10), dans le cas où le répondant est devenu résident permanent à la suite d'une demande à cet effet, l'étranger qui, à l'époque où cette demande a été faite, était un membre de la famille du répondant n'accompagnant pas ce dernier et n'a pas fait l'objet d'un contrôle. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "Section 117(9)(d) therefore excludes from the \"family class\" those non-accompanying family members whom the sponsor did not disclose, but should have disclosed, at the time the sponsor made his or her original application for permanent residence.

The reasons for dismissing the consequences of the separation on the mental health of the sponsor (no proof of the accidents and no evidence to conclusively link any such accidents directly to the separation and no treatment plan, medication nor remedies in the psychologist report) are, at best, highly debatable. Similarly, the statement that there is no conclusive proof of recent, continued and regular contact between Mr. Arif and his wife is questionable, in light of their undisputed testimony that they call each other on a regular basis, and may even be inconsistent with the previous finding that the applicants and the sponsor have a genuine and well documented relationship.

A careful reading of the CAIPS notes reveals that the Immigration officer, on more than one occasion, considers the failure to disclose as a paramount factor precluding any possibility that H&C factors could overcome the exclusion mandated by s. 117(9)(d). The following two paragraphs illustrates the Immigration officer's apparent state of mind:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"SPR states in his submissions that he feels 'alone and hopeless' and that it disturbs him so much that he 'was hardly able to continue my work, or to do my job properly'. He states that his mental health is 'serious' and that he is 'very depressed'. Letter from FN's employer indicates that he is 'sad, confused, and unfocused', which causes problems on the job. Employer states that 'he had three accidents due to lake (sic) of concentration'. Letters submitted written by friends of SPR also state that he is 'very sad', and explain that he has been in some accidents and 'paying maxium (sic) insurance premium to keep the job'.

In the present case, the Immigration officer did look at the various considerations advanced by the applicants. Nonetheless, at the end of the day, his notes read as if the failure to disclose was the overriding consideration, and that the sponsor had brought upon himself all his and his family's misfortunes. This, in turn, led the Immigration officer to analyze the positive factors supporting the sponsorship application through the prism of the sponsor's conduct at the time of his own application to become a permanent resident, and to overlook the genuineness and stability of his relationship with his wife and children, the sincere remorse of the sponsor and the likely impact of the decision on any future prospect for this family to be re-united, as Mrs. Sultana will likely not be eligible for permanent resident status under any other category given her severely limited education and language skills and the non-existence of employment skills or experience.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "In so doing, the Immigration officer fettered his discretion under s. 25(1) of", "IRPA", "and effectively allowed the applicants' exclusion under s. 117(9)(d) to unduly influence his opinion as to whether the applicants personal circumstances warranted exemption for H&C reasons.

Moreover, there is no evidence to support the Immigration officer's bald assertion and presumption that the mother and her children could turn to her parents/siblings and in-laws for emotional and other support, when the evidence indicates otherwise as they live a few hours away.

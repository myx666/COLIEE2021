On proper grounds, a person may be given a statutory (i.e. lawful) monopoly for the exclusive use of a trademark in association with specified wares or services. In the event, can it be seriously argued that by specific intendment, or by implication, the statute would not also prohibit unlawful use? At first blush, the answer to that question would appear obvious.", "\"I recognize, however, that what might be unlawful for some purposes, as in the breach of a licensing or distributorship agreement giving rise to ordinary civil remedies, would be beyond the ken of the", "Trade-marks Act", "unless it is in violation of an expressed or implied provision of it.

If public protection is one of its purposes, then a phrase like 'previously used in Canada' might very well be interpreted to mean 'previously lawfully used in Canada'.", "\"The line of distributor cases to which I have referred already provide a window to the adoption of the general propositions I have stated.

The cases have reached this conclusion in a variety of ways: prior use by the foreign supplier in Canada (s. 16(1)(a)); no 'use' by the importer/agent in Canada within the meaning of sections 4 and 16, since its use was on behalf of the principal; the mark is not distinctive of the wares of the respondent (s. 18(1)(b)); and, generally, the respondent is not the person entitled to registration of the mark, on the grounds of the fiduciary obligation existing between an agent and his principal.", "\"This last-noted ground has not stood alone as a basis to expunge, although it is a common thread running throughout the case law.

In that case, the plaintiff, a U.S. company, attempted to expunge the trademark registration of the defendant, a Canadian company, for the trademark \"Beam\" in association with central vacuum systems. The plaintiff's predecessor sold to the defendant's predecessor central vacuum systems for resale in Canada since 1975.

From 1985 to 1990, every canister for every power unit sold in Canada was marked \"Beam\" and also originated from the United States. Since 1985, the defendant purchased motors for power units directly from the manufacturer and assembled some portions of the power units in Canada.

The trademarks registered by Havana House are marks bearing the brand names of the cigars (except for the mark registered as \"Monte Cristo Habana\" which also contains a design). The cigars are manufactured and sold in Cuba bearing the marks in question. The cigars are also exported by Habanos S.A. to many countries including Canada. Following from the prior discussion, Havana House cannot be said to have \"used\" the relevant trademarks in Canada and was not entitled to register them. It is clear that the trademarks do not convey to the consumer that the distributor is the owner of the trademarks, rather, they clearly indicate that the source of the marks is the manufacturer.

Distinctive, in relation to a trademark, is defined in s. 2 of the", "Trade-marks Act", "as \"a trademark that actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others or is adapted so to distinguish them.\" As set out in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 237 (F.C.A.) and (1987), 81 N.R. 28; 17 C.P.R.(3d) 289 (F.C.A.), three conditions must be met to prove distinctiveness (at page 270 (F.C.T.D.)):", "\"1) that a mark and a product (or ware) be associated; (2) that the 'owner' uses this association between the mark and his product and is manufacturing and selling his product; and, (3) that this association enables the owner of the mark to distinguish his product from that of others.\""], ["[63]", "The question of distinctiveness is a question of fact with the test being whether a clear message has been given to the public that the wares with which the trademark is associated and used are the wares of the trademark owner and not those of another party (see", "White Consolidated", ", supra, at pages 109-111  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, the court had the following to say about distinctiveness at page 217:", "\"The function and purpose of a trademark is to indicate the source from which goods come.

In the case at bar, invalidation proceedings were launched on November 14, 1996, when the defendant filed his statement of defence and so distinctiveness will be considered as of that date. The rationale for considering distinctiveness at the start of expungement proceedings was considered in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the court wrote:", "\"As I understand (subsection 18(1)(b)), it contemplates the testing of 'distinctiveness' as of the date of commencement of the action for expungement, on the premise that a mark which was not distinctive at registration may have become distinctive in the meantime through the nature of its use by its owner, or conversely that a mark which was distinctive at registration may have lost its distinctiveness because the owner has improperly allowed others to use it or has acquiesced in its use by others.\""], ["[65]", "The defendant's submission on distinctiveness is based on the decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). The defendant argues that Havana House has lost its right to its marks because there is allegedly widespread use of the marks by other traders. The court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, considered this argument at page 144:", "\"The owner of a trademark may lose his exclusive right in the mark if he permits the widespread use of it by rival traders either by concurrence or negative action. In that event the trademark ceases to be distinctive of the owner's wares or services. But an owner does not lose his rights in his trademark because someone infringes his rights.\""], ["[66]", "The defendant's argument that there is widespread use of the marks outside of Canada is irrelevant since the issue is whether the marks are distinctive under Canadian law. There was no evidence of recognition in Canada of use of the marks in other countries. Thus, the question is whether the trademarks are distinctive in Canada. The evidence indicates that Havana House is the exclusive distributor of Cuban cigars in Canada. These cigars are imported from Habanos S.A. and distributed to other distributors and retailers in Canada for sale. Any other Cuban cigars available for resale in Canada are those that have been bought from Cuban stores and are transported out of the country as the defendant has admittedly done. Given these facts, I do not understand the defendant's argument that Havana House has allowed widespread use of the trademarks by rival traders. Havana House has supply agreements with other Canadian retailers and distributors and has prosecuted other persons whom it believes have infringed its rights. I do not think distinctiveness can be founded on this argument."], ["[67]", "However, as I held above, use by Havana House of the trademarks constitutes use by the foreign entity. The trademarks are therefore distinctive of the manufacturer's cigars rather than Havana House (see", "Industrie  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 155  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Thus, the only possible ground upon which Havana House can maintain its registration is if it can prove that it has acquired distinctiveness in the trademarks such that it was entitled to use them as of November 14, 1996. After carefully considering the submitted materials, I can find no evidence that the message to the public is that Havana House is the owner of the trademark. The only mark on the cigar boxes and in Havana House's advertising states that Havana House is an exclusive distributor of Cuban cigars. The plaintiff cited the cross-examination of John Broen, Vice-President, Corporate Affairs of Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc., who stated that Havana House is known as the source of Cuban cigars in Canada. However, my interpretation of Mr. Broen's statement is that Havana House is the distribution source of the Cuban cigars in issue, not that it is the manufacturing source, nor that the public associates the trademarks with Havana House as a manufacturer or as the marks of a distributor. In the absence of other evidence, I cannot conclude that Havana House has acquired distinctiveness in the cigars."], ["[68]", "Therefore, I must hold that there is no contestable issue and the defendant should receive summary judgment.

Thus, there is some question about who bought the cigars.

Mr. Ortego submits that this infestation results from poor quality control and would never have occurred if they had been distributed within the plaintiffs' quality control system. However, Mr. Ortego stated on cross-examination that some variation in quality does occur in their quality control system and that there have been rare cases of insect infestation.

Mr. Ortego submitted that these purchases in Cuba were made in stores that were not owned or run by any of the plaintiffs. Mr. Jiwa's affidavit directly contradicts this statement and contends that the cigars were bought from the plaintiffs' own outlets in Cuba.

The plaintiff sought a mandatory interlocutory injunction to end the boycott until trial.

The court dismissed the motions and cross-motions but made the following observations about quality control in a passing off action (at pages 21-22  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ):", "\"These defendants also argue that if trans-shipping is permitted they will lose their control over the timeliness of the sale of products to consumers. This may result in products being sold outside the optimum taste date and thus damage their reputation. In essence, that seems to be a specific example of how damage to goodwill might occur. These defendants cite no authority for their position. Several cases in the Federal Court have considered, often somewhat tangentially, the question of quality control and found it to be a factor in evaluating irreparable harm. These cases, however, dealt with quality control in terms of the original production of the product.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (F.C.T.D.), involved the importation of copycat E.T. figures from Taiwan that were apparently of inferior quality to the officially licensed products.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (F.C.T.D.), involved a concern that Fruit of the Loom could not exercise control over the manufacture of the clothing articles in question.", "688863  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), is the only case to raise quality control in relation to food items. There though, the issue was a small restaurant which used the same name as a larger chain. The chain successfully argued that the confusion regarding the name might cause confusion among customers and if the food in the small restaurant was inferior it would damage the reputation of the chain. In light of these decisions it appears open to the Court to find that a lack of ability to exercise quality control constitutes irreparable harm. On the other hand the present case must be distinguished on the ground that genuine Coca-Cola products are involved. Unlike the other cases, there is no issue as to the quality of the production or manufacture of the items. Lack of quality control in distribution does not amount to irreparable harm. In this Court's opinion, the answer ought to be no. The claim that the product might be exported and might be sold after the optimum taste period which might make certain customers unhappy and might therefore cause some damage to the reputation of these defendants is speculative. Applying the rule in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the evidence of harm must be clear and not speculative, these defendants have failed to make out their case on this point.\""], ["[83]", "Thus, it appears that it may be open to the court to rule that a defendant's lack of quality control may damage the plaintiffs' goodwill. However, in the case at bar there is no evidence that the defendant has engaged in poor quality control methods such that I could rule that there is no triable issue."], ["[84]", "Before concluding, I must also refer to two decisions dealing with grey marketing. In", "Consumers  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the respondent, the authorized distributor of Seiko watches in Canada, brought an action to restrain the appellant from selling Seiko watches since it was not an authorized dealer. The appellant had been selling Seiko watches that it had lawfully obtained outside Canada from an authorized dealer selling outside the distribution network. The plaintiffs argued that grey marketing decisions are of no import because they deal with licensing and there is no licensing agreement or assignment in the case at bar. However, I believe that the court's discussion about the creation of a practical monopoly on a product, the right to control resale and the effect on free competition are relevant. At pages 599-600  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the court wrote:", "\"It is difficult, at first blush, to bring the conduct of the appellant within the concept of passing off. The appellant is selling precisely the same watch, coming from the same source, as the respondent. The watch is protected by a guarantee not in the respondent's name but in the name of the maker, Hattori. The quality of the product must have some bearing on the respondent's success and consequent development of business and goodwill in the trade. The watches sold in each branch of the trade, of course, were only and always those of Hattori. The respondent purports to bring itself within the classified definition of the doctrine by associating with the watch features which are unique to the selling technique employed by the respondent. The respondent is able to do this, so the argument goes, because of its contractual relationship with the supplier of Seiko watches, Hattori, which in turn supplies the respondent with the power of limiting the manufacturer's warranty to watches sold by dealers authorized by the respondent. Axiomatically, the appellant and persons (such as Woolco and K-Mart) who, according to the evidence, carry on a like business, are unable to merchandise the watches in this manner, as they are not authorized dealers. The problem facing the respondent is that the logical extension of this proposal grants to a vendor, in the position of the respondent, a monopoly on the sale in Canada of a product to the same extent as it would enjoy if the product were subject to a patent of invention issued to the respondent under the", "Patent Act", "of Canada. A second cul-de-sac into which such a submission necessarily leads is that the common law, in its personal property sector, would thereby be recognizing a right to entail and control the sale of personal property, however legitimately acquired, where another person, in the position of the vendor, was also marketing the identical item of personal property. Such a principle is foreign to our law. This right to control resale would, it follows, flow not only to the respondent and all others upon whom the manufacturer wishes to bestow this protection, but to the manufacturer Hattori which, on terms presumably satisfactory to itself, released these watches into the distribution stream which eventually carried them to the appellant. Ironically, the manufacturer, with the profits from its sale of these watches in its pocket, could then, if this is the law, restrain the appellant from reselling these watches. A third consequence would be an inevitable collision between such a result, on one hand, and the common law doctrine with respect to restraint of trade and free competition, on the other hand.\""], ["[85]", "I will also refer to the decision in", "Smith & Nephew", ", supra, where the Federal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in arriving at the conclusion that the respondent grey marketer had not violated the", "Trade-marks Act", ". In this case, the applicant was the Canadian licensee and importer of goods bearing the trademark \"Nivea\" which was registered by Beiersdorf AG (BDF). The respondents were the importer/distributor and the retailer of goods bearing that trademark.

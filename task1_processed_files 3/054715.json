Alternatively, the RPD panel could find that the risk factors raised by the Applicant were merely generalized risk, or that they amounted to harassment or treatment but fell short of persecution. Finally, the Applicant contended that the Officer failed to consider the objective documentary evidence that was provided showing the potential risk of kidnapping for the two children in Columbia."], ["[25]", "These arguments are without merit. Subsection 25(1.3) of the Act, which came into effect on June 29, 2010 (prior to the Applicant's submission of his application), specifically prohibits consideration of factors related to sections 96 and 97 of the Act in the evaluation of H&C claims, but must consider the elements of hardship affecting applicants.

Officers, however, must assess that evidence through the lens of the subsection 25(1) test - is the applicant personally and directly suffering unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship?", "The role of the officer, then, is to consider the facts presented through a lens of hardship, not to undertake another section 96 or 97 risk assessment or substitute his decision for the Refugee Protection Division's findings under sections 96 and 97.

The panel found that the alleged agents of persecution did not actually do anything other than follow the claimant and her sister, and that the claimant had not established a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm in the event she returns to Mexico. While that decision had not been made when the Officer assessed the H&C application, it nevertheless demonstrates that it was reasonable to assume the RPD would consider whatever risk allegations were made on the refugee claim. It cannot be said, therefore, that the Officer fettered his discretion or washed his hands of the risk allegations: it was clearly beyond his mandate to look into risk factors, and it could safely be presumed that the RPD would make a determination in that respect."], ["[29]", "The Applicant's second argument is that the Officer erred by assessing establishment against a \"similarly situated individuals\" threshold.

Analyzing all these factors, the Officer concluded the Applicant's establishment did not attain an exceptional level."], ["[32]", "I find the Officer's conclusion was reasonable based on the record before him, as it clearly falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible on the law and facts of the Applicant's circumstances. In the letter supporting the Applicant's H&C application, counsel asserted that the couple is facing separation should they be forced to leave Canada. However, the letter is brief and contains no evidence or explanation as to why the family could not be reunited either in Columbia or Mexico. When specifically questioned at the hearing on this matter, counsel for the Applicant acknowledged that she was not aware of any obstacle preventing either spouse to sponsor each other and their children in Columbia or in Mexico."], ["[33]", "Finally, the Applicant contended that the Officer erred in finding insufficient evidence existed to conclude the children's best interests could not be met in either Columbia or Mexico. The Applicant claims that their documentary evidence, namely the", "Child Development Index Report", "by Save the Children (an NGO), establishing that Canada ranks higher in development factors than either Columbia or Mexico, amounts to such evidence.

The Applicant's H&C application makes no reference to his two minor children as being part of his application. In the letter from his counsel accompanying his H&C application, the only reference to the children (apart from the generalized risk of kidnapping already alluded to) is the fact that they do not have status in the country of either of the parents.

They cited statistics from the documentation, which were also considered by the H&C Officer, to show that Canada is a more desirable place to live in general. But the fact that Canada is a more desirable place to live is not determinative on an H&C application ( ...); if it were otherwise, the huge majority of people living illegally in Canada would have to be granted permanent resident status for Humanitarian and Compassionate reasons.

There was no evidence that the children would not be able to access health care and education in Columbia or Mexico, and it was certainly not sufficient to show that Canada is a more favourable country to live than the country of origin of their parents. It is also to be presumed that the Officer considered the report submitted by the Applicant, even though he did not specifically address it."], ["[38]", "For all of the above reasons, I find that there is no basis for judicial intervention and the application for judicial review is dismissed.

Cette preuve ne constitue pas une preuve établissant, selon le critère énoncé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , que le demandeur serait personnellement et directement exposé à ce risque. Par conséquent, la conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle l'évaluation du risque débordait du cadre de l'examen de la demande CH est raisonnable au vu du dossier."], ["[28]", "D'ailleurs, je note que la SPR a depuis rejeté la demande d'asile de l'épouse du demandeur au motif que la crainte de celle-ci que ses enfants soient kidnappés s'ils retournaient au Mexique était spéculative. La SPR a conclu que les agents de persécution allégués n'avaient rien fait d'autre de concret que de suivre la demanderesse et sa sœur et qu'elle n'avait pas établi de possibilité sérieuse de persécution ou un risque de préjudice dans l'éventualité où elle retournerait au Mexique. Certes, cette décision n'a pas été rendue pendant que l'agent examinait la demande CH, mais elle démontre néanmoins qu'il était raisonnable de présumer que la SPR considérerait toutes les allégations de risque qui avaient été faites dans la demande d'asile. En conséquence, on ne peut pas dire que l'agent a entravé son pouvoir discrétionnaire ou s'est lavé les mains des allégations de risque: cela dépassait clairement le cadre de son mandat, et on peut présumer à juste titre que la SPR se serait prononcée à cet égard."], ["[29]", "Le demandeur avance comme deuxième argument que l'agent a commis une erreur en appréciant l'établissement selon le critère « des personnes qui sont dans une situation semblable ». Il prétend que les éléments de preuve que lui et son épouse ont présentés touchant leur emploi au Canada, les lettres de recommandation de la communauté, les baux, les avis de cotisation et les photos de familles, constituent des éléments de preuve suffisants pour démontrer leur établissement sur une base individuelle."], ["[30]", "Encore là, je ne saurais donner raison au demandeur qui, en fait, soutient que l'agent aurait dû apprécier différemment la preuve. Comme il a été déjà mentionné, les décisions CH sont des décisions discrétionnaires où l'agent doit déterminer si le demandeur ferait face à des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives. La section 11.5 du Guide IP5 indique clairement que « [l]e fait que le demandeur a un certain degré d'établissement au Canada ne satisfait pas nécessairement au critère relatif aux difficultés ». C'est au demandeur qu'incombe la responsabilité de faire valoir les motifs sur lesquels repose sa demande et d'en établir les faits."], ["[31]", "Le demandeur en l'espèce n'a pas convaincu l'agent que sa situation personnelle était telle que les difficultés auxquels il serait exposé s'il devait demander la résidence permanente depuis l'extérieur du Canada de la manière habituelle seraient inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives. L'agent a examiné les éléments de preuve présentés par le demandeur au sujet de son établissement au Canada, notamment le relevé d'emploi du demandeur et celui de son épouse, ainsi que leurs activités de bénévolat dans la collectivité. Il a aussi noté que leur établissement n'était pas le résultat d'une incapacité prolongée de quitter le Canada, ou qu'il était attribuable à des circonstances hors de leur contrôle. En analysant tous ces facteurs, l'agent a conclu que l'établissement du demandeur n'avait pas atteint un niveau exceptionnel."], ["[32]", "J'estime que la conclusion de l'agent était raisonnable au vu du dossier dont il disposait, et qu'elle appartient clairement, eu égard à la situation du demandeur, aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et droit. Dans sa lettre à l'appui de la demande CH du demandeur, l'avocate du demandeur a affirmé que le couple qu'elle défendait risquait de se séparer s'il était forcé de quitter le Canada. Mais la lettre est succincte et ne renferme aucun témoignage ou explication sur les raisons qui empêcheraient la famille d'être réunie en Colombie ou au Mexique. Lorsqu'elle a été interrogée précisément sur cette question à l'audience, l'avocate du demandeur a reconnu qu'elle ne voyait aucun obstacle qui empêcherait l'un ou l'autre des époux de parrainer leurs enfants et de se parrainer réciproquement en Colombie ou au Mexique."], ["[33]", "Enfin, le demandeur prétend que l'agent a commis une erreur en concluant à l'existence d'une preuve insuffisante permettant d'inférer que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants ne serait pas respecté en Colombie ou au Mexique. Le demandeur avance que sa preuve documentaire, à savoir l'", "Indice de développement de l'enfant", "dont fait rapport Save the Children (une ONG), qui établit que le Canada se classe mieux que la Colombie ou le Mexique en matière de facteurs de développement, équivaut à une telle preuve. Puisque l'agent n'a pas fait référence explicitement à ce rapport, le demandeur soutient qu'il ne s'est pas montré « réceptif, attentif et sensible » à tous les aspects touchant l'intérêt supérieur des enfants, et qu'il n'a pas examiné un élément de preuve pertinent."], ["[34]", "Je ne peux me ranger à cet argument. Le critère juridique pour apprécier l'intérêt supérieur d'un enfant exige effectivement de l'agent qui analyse une demande CH qu'il se montre « réceptif, attentif et sensible » à l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 75. Toutefois, cette analyse ne se fait pas dans l'abstrait; elle doit se faire dans le contexte du traitement que fait l'agent d'une demande CH:", "Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."], ["[35]", "Étant donné les renseignements limités fournis par le demandeur au sujet de ses enfants mineurs, l'application de ce critère par l'agent était raisonnable. La demande CH du demandeur ne mentionne aucunement ses deux enfants mineurs comme faisant partie de sa demande. Dans la lettre de son avocate jointe à sa demande, la seule référence aux enfants (hormis le risque généralisé de kidnapping déjà évoqué) est le fait qu'ils n'ont pas de statut dans les pays d'origine réciproques des parents. Le demandeur n'a pas expliqué comment l'intérêt supérieur de ses enfants ne serait pas servi s'ils retournaient en Colombie ou au Mexique."], ["[36]", "Il ne suffit pas de décrire simplement les conditions générales qui sont pires dans le pays de renvoi, comparativement aux conditions prévalant au Canada. Le demandeur doit démontrer la probabilité que lui et ses enfants soient assujettis à ces conditions personnellement. Comme je l'ai écrit dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 31:", "Enfin, les demandeurs font valoir que la situation en Argentine est pitoyable et néfaste pour les enfants. Ils citent des statistiques tirées de la preuve documentaire que l'agente d'immigration a elle-même examinée pour démontrer que le Canada est un endroit plus agréable pour vivre en général. Mais le fait que le Canada soit un endroit plus agréable pour vivre n'est pas un facteur déterminant dans l'issue d'une demande fondée sur des raisons d'ordre humanitaires [...]; s'il en était autrement, il faudrait donner à la vaste majorité des personnes qui vivent illégalement au Canada le statut de résident permanent pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire.

Aucune preuve n'indiquait que les enfants n'accéderaient pas aux soins de santé et à l'éducation en Colombie ou au Mexique, et il n'était assurément pas suffisant de démontrer que le Canada est un endroit plus agréable pour vivre que le pays d'origine de leurs parents. Il convient également de présumer que l'agent a examiné le rapport présenté par le demandeur, même s'il n'y a pas fait mention spécifiquement."], ["[38]", "Pour tous les motifs qui précèdent, je conclus que rien ne justifie l'intervention de la Cour, et la demande de contrôle judiciaire sera rejetée. Le demandeur ne m'a pas persuadé que l'agent avait commis une erreur dans l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire ou que sa décision était déraisonnable, compte tenu des faits qui lui avaient été soumis et du droit applicable.

The complexity of this evidence is important to state prior to engaging in an evaluation of the legal and factual finding made by the RPD:", "\"I am 51 years of age, a citizen of Korea South, and of no other country. I met my husband, JEONG, Deok Soo, while we worked together at Hampyung Public Health office in Korea in 1976. I had dated him from March 1977. I was a devoted Christian and while we were dating I evangelized to him and he agreed to believe in God. With this promise, on January 1, 1982, we got married. On June 15, 1983, I had my first child and my husband wanted to have more children, but I avoided having more children since I was studying theology at the time. However, in January 1994, I was pregnant again. In August 1994 my husband had a traffic accident and he was hospitalized for three years. Due to his severe physical injury he lost his job and was not able to support our family any longer. I had to [sic] my second child but I was not able to rest after my delivery since I had to work to support our family and also take care of my husband. Under these circumstances, my husband became more abusive and violent. My husband has a big body and weights [sic] 105kg and is 180cm tall. Whenever he was angry, I was scared and had great fear but tried to overcome it with my belief in God. However, I was not able to endure his abusive behaviour and wanted to separate. Therefore, in October 1995, I went to Seoul with my two children and my mother-in-law took care of my husband. However, from time to time, my husband came to us and asked for money and complained about my religious life. In January 1996 I served as an assistant pastor and I used to prepare floral arrangements for Sunday worship service in our church. He followed me and grabbed my neck from behind and dragged me onto the road. In May 1996, my husband called my name outside of the church and he broke the window of the church with a thick wooden stick. When I was assigned as an assistant pastor, his temper flared because he did not approve of my religious activities. For this reason, I was always afraid of my husband.", "\"As I was not able to endure my husband's threats and harassment, I borrowed money from my friends and siblings and opened a business in October 1996 for my husband. My husband operated the business and I did not involve myself with the business. However, he had no ability to operate the business and our house was on power of sale. Therefore, I and my two children moved from place to place. In April 1997, when we lived in a small one-room residence, my husband came to us and asked for money and to live with us. When I said that I had no money to give him and did not want to live with him, he pushed me on the ground and hit me. In October 1997 as his business was declining, he came to me again and threatened me because he believed that since I believed in God, his business was declining and had no luck. When I replied that he should sell the business and live calmly, he hit and pushed me and I fell down and lost consciousness. I was so afraid and have been suffering from deep migraines since then.", "\"In May 1998, he came again and he hit my face many times while swearing. I fell down and bled from my mouth due to severe teeth and gum injury. As a result, I needed surgery for my wounded and infected gums from the injury. I have been treated every week for three years every week.", "\"In February 2000, my heart was closed towards him and I had a great fear of my husband. I hated him a lot, so I fled from him but he found us and forcefully had sex with me. I was so shamed and humiliated due to his behaviour as he asked me to follow what he watched in a porn video. As a devoted Christian and a pastor in a church, I was not able to report his behaviour to the police and also I did not call the police since the Korean police did not do anything for this kind of domestic violence. I was also afraid of my husband's reaction if called [sic] the police.", "\"In January 2004 due to severe physical abuse and fear of my husband, I was not able to move so I was confined to bed. With the help of my friends I was taken to the hospital and was medically examined. Most of my body was swollen and had many physical problems. Due to my husband's physical abuse and severe mental stress, in December 2004, I was bleeding for over 40 days and I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I had had a transfusion of blood and a medical operation.", "\"After recovering from this incident, I studied family counselling at IRE Family Counselling Research Institute from March 2004 to May 2005. During the time, I also served as a part time youth counsellor as practicum. In January 2006, I invited a church minister to dinner and my husband was there. During a conversation, when I laughed, my husband suddenly slammed the table and stood up and yelled at me, saying that I laughed at other men but not him. I also met with a family counsellor, but my husband and I were too far apart, and I could not avoid my husband's abuse. He had an obsession for me so he was suspicious of me since I avoided him for many years. His forceful and abusive sex was another physical abuse so I was scared and had a great fear of my husband.", "\"I took a Master of Divinity course at Pyongyang Theological Seminary from March 2005 to December 2007 and I was ordained as a pastor in December 2007. My husband was mad for my ordination since he really did not want me to be involved in religious matters.", "\"In December 2007, my husband had to close his business and had no place to live. He found and came to my place again and when I refused him he immediately attempted to hit me. As I found that I was not able to get rid of him in Korea, I left Korea seeking a safe place from my husband's physical and mental abuse. I also felt that I was not able to perform my religious duties as a pastor due to my husband. For these reasons I am not able to return back to Korea South.\" (Applicant's Application Record, pp. 31 - 33)"], ["[3]", "The Applicant's decision not to seek state protection in South Korea is the central feature of the RPD decision.

She says that she did not approach the authorities at any time because she heard from other victims of domestic violence that the police do not really provide a solution. She also stated that domestic violence is considered a shame, that she was afraid of her husband, and that she was concerned how it would look on her due to her work in a church.

One need only recall the centuries old law that a man is entitled to beat his wife with a stick \"no thicker than his thumb\".", "'Laws do not spring out of a social vacuum. The notion that a man has a right to \"discipline\" his wife is deeply rooted in the history of our society. The woman's duty was to serve her husband and to stay in the marriage at all costs \"till death do us part\" and to accept as her due any \"punishment\" that was meted out for failing to please her husband. One consequence of this attitude was that \"wife battering\" was rarely spoken of, rarely reported, rarely prosecuted, and even more rarely punished. Long after society abandoned its formal approval of spousal abuse tolerance of it continued and continues in some circles to this day.", "'Fortunately, there has been a growing awareness in recent years that no man has a right to abuse any woman under any circumstances. Legislative initiatives designed to educate police, judicial officers and the public, as well as more aggressive investigation and charging policies all signal a concerted effort by the criminal justice system to take spousal abuse seriously. However, a woman who comes before a judge or jury with the claim that she has been battered and suggests that this may be a relevant factor in evaluating her subsequent actions still faces the prospect of being condemned by popular mythology about domestic violence.

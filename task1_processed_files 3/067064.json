They claimed to be Convention refugees or otherwise in need of protection because the principal applicant, Mr. Agri, a businessman in Mendoza province witnessed the murder of a fellow businessman. Police involvement was alleged. Their claim was dismissed. However, they were entitled to have a PRRA before returning to Argentina. They availed themselves of that opportunity. The evidence they filed included four documents which the officer would not consider on the grounds that they were not new evidence. The officer correctly noted that they related to incidents that predated the refugee rejection decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board)."], ["[3]", "Section 113(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001 c. 27 provides:", "113.

Furthermore, the guideline titled “Applying for a pre-removal risk assessment - unsuccessful refugee claimants” was misleading, in the sense that it was incomplete. Although the guideline did state that new evidence included evidence which was not normally accessible or would not reasonably have been expected to have been presented to the Board, and that it was important to clearly identify such new evidence, it was not specifically stated that such new evidence had to be accompanied by an explanation as to why it had not been available and presented earlier.

Nevertheless, Mr. Nemeth appeared alone before the Board and said he had no need for counsel. During the hearing it became evident that Mr. Nemeth did not understand what he had to do and it was too late to correct the shortcomings. The application for judicial review was allowed, because although Mr. Nemeth had not been abandoned by counsel and had waived his right to be represented by counsel, he did not receive a fair hearing as the Board had been aware that he had been represented until the last minute, and should have been alive to the risk that he was ill-prepared to represent himself.

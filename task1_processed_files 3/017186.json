Alternatively, the panel finds that the claimant has a viable internal flight alternative in Mexico.

As the onus fell to the applicant in that case to prove her claim and she did not provide the necessary documentary evidence in support of it, the panel drew an adverse inference from this deficiency. In this case, the utter lack of corroborating documentation to support the fact of the roadblock incident in April 2001 and the phone calls from the FARC in Barranquilla, Medellin and Mexico City leads the panel to disbelieve, on a balance of probabilities, that the roadblock incident and the phone calls occurred and the FARC is after the claimant.

I find that this is the just result in the present case."], ["[6]", "In my opinion it is not possible to make an alternative finding in a case where negative credibility determination effectively extinguishes a claim for refugee protection because, in such a case, there no facts upon which to make an alternative finding. In the present case the negative credibility finding was agreed to be erroneous, and, as a result, on the principle stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , regardless of the alternative finding, the decision must be set aside.", "ORDER"], ["[7]", "Accordingly, I set aside the decision for review and send the matter back for redetermination before a differently constituted panel."], ["[8]", "There is no question to certify.", "Application allowed.", "Editor: Sharon McCartney/vnh", "[End of document]"]]}

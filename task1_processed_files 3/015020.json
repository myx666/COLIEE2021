The Applicant argues that the parent/child and family bond is a strong factor that was overlooked in this case and the Officer failed to analyze that connection and take it into account when dealing with establishment. As the record shows, the Applicant simply listed his father and four siblings who live in Pakistan. There was nothing to suggest he has any ongoing relationship with them and, although that can be presumed in most cases, the facts before the Officer were that the Applicant had worked in UAE for some six years at the time of his application.

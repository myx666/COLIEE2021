On December 4, 2013, the Minister intervened in the claim and submitted a Five Country Conference Report (FCC) from the United Kingdom (UK), dated November 20, 2013. The report, based on fingerprint comparison, confirmed that the Applicant's biometric information matched a UK file for Majid Bahari, alias Moussa Mosavi, date of birth December 31, 1971, who had been fingerprinted in the UK on February 2005 and again on June 16, 2010, for the purpose of an asylum claim.

In his revised BOC the Applicant claims that he fled Iran on a false passport in September 2004 with the assistance of an agent. When his false passport was detected, he was detained in Germany and made a claim for asylum. He alleges that in Germany he was mistreated and subjected to racism, so, some months later, he utilized an agent to assist him in going to the UK, via France. He made a refugee claim in the UK in February 2005 but was removed back to Germany. He remained there for a few months and then decided to go again to the UK via France. He lived in the UK for five years. An agent there told him that after five years he could make another claim for asylum, as the UK did not keep fingerprint records for that long, and advised him not to disclose that he had been in the UK or Europe or that he had made a claim in Germany. He once again claimed asylum in the UK in 2010 and was discovered and sent back to Germany. On the same day that he arrived in Germany, he left for France. He stayed there for six or seven months, then re-entered the UK, where he stayed for about two years. Being concerned about his lack of status and fearing being returned to Germany and then Iran, particularly as he had now become a Christian, he again retained an agent, this time coming to Canada via France and Spain. The agent told him not to disclose his claim in Germany because, if he did, he would again be returned there."], ["[4]", "The RPD found that the determinative issue was identity, which the Applicant had not established, and that there was also no credible basis for his claim pursuant to s 107(2) of the IRPA.", "Issues"], ["[5]", "The issues in this matter can be formulated as follows:", "i.

Further, the Notice of Intent to Intervene filed by the Minister stated that the Minister intended to intervene for the purposes of credibility and program integrity and that the Minister had received information that seriously undermined the Applicant's credibility. The Minister submitted that, based on the information set out in the notice, there was a serious reason to doubt the Applicant's evidence with regard to his identity, basis for claim, places of residence and travel route to Canada.

The Applicant also explained that it might take time to get the documents. Because his name was on them it would not be safe to send them by courier, but his relatives could perhaps utilize a private scanner and send them by email or deliver them through a relative's transit company.

He then stated that he had given the UK authorities his military card and that they had converted his birthdate from the Farsi to the Gregorian calendar.

Further, that the usual way of spelling his name is what he gave in the UK, \"[b]ut it could also be spelled in a different way too\".

The first was a letter from Mohammad Hossein Behary stating that he was the father of Majeed Behary and attaching a copy of the former's national identity card. This was sent by Ali Kurdy, who identified the Applicant as his uncle and who had been asked by his grandfather, Mohammad Hossein Behary, to email his letter. He also attached a copy of his own national identity card. There was also a letter of support from Mohammad Reya Karimi, a friend of the Applicant, who met him in England in 2011.

Based on the lack of security features and the contradictions between the shenasnameh and the military service card, the RPD concluded it was fraudulent.

Therefore, the RPD accorded it little weight."], ["[45]", "The RPD also considered other aliases used by the Applicant. His testimony was that when he left Iran in 2004 he used a Greek passport. When he was arrested in Germany in November 2004 he was using a binational passport of Italy and Argentina.

Therefore, this had a negative impact on his credibility."], ["[47]", "The fact that the Applicant had not been forthright in providing any information from Germany or the UK, where he had initiated refugee proceedings, also negatively impacted on his credibility."], ["[48]", "Further, the Applicant testified that upon arrest in France he had given the French authorities the name Moussa Mousavi. This was not disclosed in his initial or amended BOC. His explanation for this was that he was not asked about being arrested in France. The RPD found this to be unreasonable, especially as he had given a false name for the purpose of avoiding being returned to Germany. This also impacted negatively on his credibility, as did the fact that he was prepared to invent a name whenever it suited his purposes to do so."], ["[49]", "The RPD also noted the numerous false documents that the Applicant obtained and used in his lifetime. The RPD acknowledged that there are situations where individuals must flee their countries using fraudulent documents. However, it found that the Applicant was simply someone who had the wherewithal to obtain and use false documents to move between countries, even countries where he was safe from the persecution he feared in Iran. This undermined the weight the RPD could give to any documentary evidence the Applicant submitted to establish his identity."], ["[50]", "Finally, the RPD noted that it had asked the Applicant whether he knew that it was important to produce genuine documents to a refugee board. His response was that in Europe people make a claim in any given name and once it is accepted, they obtain a legal name change to their real name. The RPD did not find this to be believable and found that it too undermined the credibility of the Applicant."], ["[51]", "In sum, the RPD found that there was no persuasive evidence establishing the Applicant's nationality."], ["[52]", "While I have some reservations as to the RPD's findings as to the authenticity of the shenasnameh, in view of the totality of the evidence of identity and credibility as addressed by the RPD, I have concluded that the matter does not warrant the Court's intervention. As stated in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :"], ["[22] This Court has found on numerous occasions that the issue of identity is at the very core of the RPD's expertise; thus, the Court needs to caution itself not to simply second-guess the RPD. As stated by Justice Mary Gleason in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :"], ["[48] ... In my view,", "provided that there is some evidence to support the Board's identity-related conclusions, provided the RPD offers some reasons for its conclusions (that are not clearly specious) and provided there is no glaring inconsistency between the Board's decision and the weight of the evidence in the record, the RPD's determination on identity warrants deference and will fall within the purview of a reasonable decision", ".

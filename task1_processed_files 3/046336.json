Referees Mark Abramovitz and Guy Lafrance (the referees) were appointed by the Minister of Labour to hear the appeals (section 251.12 of the CLC). It is important to point out that these appeals pertained not only to the inclusion of the difference in the payment order but also to other errors that the inspectors made when calculating the \"wages and other amounts\" to which the employees were entitled under Part III of the CLC (sections 251.1 and 251.18 of the CLC)."], ["[12]", "This type of appeal is heard", "de novo", "by the referee, who has the authority to confirm, rescind or vary, in whole or in part, a payment order issued by an inspector (paragraph 251.12(4)(", ") of the CLC and arbitral jurisprudence for the", "de novo", "aspect). With regard to the matter of whether or not to include the difference in the original payment orders, the referees agreed with the directors by deducting the difference from the amended payment orders, which is why this application for judicial review was filed by the applicant, who in this case represents the interests of the Crown and the Minister of National Revenue."], ["[13]", "A number of factors point to a standard of reasonableness."], ["[14]", "First, it is important to mention the full privative clause set out in subsections 251.12(6) and (7) of the CLC and the discrete administrative regime set out in subsection 251.12(1) of the CLC under which the referees have special expertise."], ["[15]", "In addition, the interpretation by an adjudicative tribunal of its enabling statue (in this case the CLC) or of statutes closely related to its functions must be reviewed on the standard of reasonableness:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2014] FCJ No 455;", "Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] SCJ No 61;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2013] SCJ No 67."], ["[16]", "Moreover, I am not satisfied that, in this case, the applicant was raising a question of general law that is both of central importance to the legal system as a whole and outside the adjudicator's specialized area of expertise.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (", "Dunsmuir)", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] SCJ No 59;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 537, affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in 2013 FCA 131, [2013] FCJ No 551."], ["[17]", "The applicant is basically claiming that the referees erred by determining that the benefits received under the WEPP constituted \"wages and other amounts\" under the CLC. Similarly, the CLC does not contain any provisions indicating that the wage claim an employee files against a bankrupt employer should be decreased because the employee allegedly received WEPP benefits. The only amounts that can be deducted from an employee's wages are those set out in subsection 254.1(4) of the CLC. In this regard, the applicant claims that, under the CLC, the role of the referee consists solely of determining the amounts that the employer, and the employer alone, failed to pay its employee. Thus, any amount that the employee receives from a third party (in this case the WEPP) is not relevant in determining the amount of the payment order."], ["[18]", "The directors (appellants before the referee) and the employees (respondents before the referee) of the bankrupt employers joined together as respondents in the two applications for judicial review, which were combined for the purposes of the hearing. Before this court, the directors maintained that the arbitral awards were reasonable. The employees did not intervene in the matter, and they never challenged the legality of the arbitral awards. The Court was informed by counsel that the employees had already received or should be receiving the amounts set out in the amended payment orders since no order was issued to stay the execution of the arbitral awards."], ["[19]", "This application for judicial review must fail and there is no need to intervene in this case. The referees' finding that the total amount of the benefits paid to Exeltech and Centre Montréal Jet employees under the WEPP Act must be deducted from the payment orders made under the CLC constitutes a legally acceptable and defensible outcome that is based on the evidence in the record. The referees could base their general reasoning on the reasons set out in the decision of Referee Garden in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (", "Schneider)", ". They could also conclude that, if those deductions were not made, the employees would receive an amount greater than that to which they were entitled."], ["[20]", "Without repeating all of the arguments that were submitted by the directors in their written submissions and at the hearing of these applications for judicial review, I accept the substance of their claims. I would like to note in passing that the employees did not appear before the Court and they did not object before the referees to the full amounts received from the WEPP (benefits) and the trustees (dividends) being deducted from the payment orders issued in their favour. However, Exeltech's accountant, Gérard Moretti, who had submitted a wage claim on his own behalf, testified at the appeal hearing before Referee Abramowitz that the total amount of $3,096.45 should be excluded, since he did not want to be put in a situation where the Crown could later come back and request repayment of any overpayment from him."], ["[21]", "Subsection 251(1) of the CLC reads as follows:", "251.

The CLC does not provide a definition of \"other amounts\". Contrary to the applicant's claim, nothing in the CLC indicates that the role of the referee is limited to determining the amounts that the employer and the employer alone failed to pay its employee. The applicant's contention that any amount paid to an employee who submitted a wage claim by a third party (trustee or WEPP) must not be taken into account by the inspector or referee seems to me to be contrary to the letter and the spirit of the CLC."], ["[25]", "The directors submitted that the applicant's position is illogical. They pointed out that the amounts reimbursed under the WEPP and the amounts owed under the CLC were calculated by the inspectors using the same data as the trustees used. By way of evidence, the inspectors already deducted from the payment orders the super-priority amount (maximum of $2,000) that was included in the eligible wages under the WEPP (maximum of $3,000 plus indexing amount). One of the inspectors also deducted the dividends that some employees received from the trustee, and the appeal of this point was allowed in the other case. This clearly shows that the inspectors interpret and apply the provisions of the CLC by deducting certain amounts received by the employees under the Bankruptcy Act and the WEPP Act from the \"wages and other amounts.\" That makes sense. I therefore agree with the directors that the difference should also have been deducted."], ["[26]", "Although Referee Abramowitz and Referee Lafrance were not bound or obligated to follow the decision of another colleague, they were free to rely on the reasoning of Referee Garden in", "Schneider", ", which seems not only reasonable to me in this case, but also convincing:", "The question I must firstly answer is whether s. 251(1) authorizes an inspector to offset a payment from WEPPA against the \"wages or other amounts\" which an employer has failed to pay. I note that in this case the Inspector did take the WEPPA payments into account in her preliminary calculations but not in her revised calculations which resulted in the payment orders. The wording of s. 251(1) does not appear restricted to payments made only by the employer but rather includes \"wages or other amounts actually paid to the employee (emphasis added) under this Part\" and arguably therefor may include payments made to employees by third parties such as WEPPA."], ["[27]", "I also agree with the directors that subsection 254.1(4) of the CLC refers only to the deductions that the employer can make. This provision deals with the amounts that can be deducted by an", "employer", ", not an", "inspector", "appointed under section 251 of the CLC. As a result, this provision is not applicable in this case. Specifically, the provision provides as follows:", "254.1 (4) The Governor in Council may make regulations prescribing:", "(a) deductions that an employer is permitted to make in addition to those permitted by this section; and", "(b) the manner in which the deductions permitted by this section may be made by the employer.", "254.1 (4) Le gouverneur en conseil peut, par règlement, prévoir:", "a) les autres retenues que l'employeur peut faire sur le salaire de l'employé ou sur les utres sommes qui lui sont dues;", "b) la façon dont l'employeur peut effectuer les retenues prévues au présent article."], ["[28]", "It is also not unreasonable to consider the benefits paid following a bankruptcy under the WEPP Act as \"wages and other amounts to which an employee is entitled under this Part\" of the CLC. The inspectors' records and the tables produced by the parties show, as Referee Abramowitz clearly pointed out, that the amounts reimbursed under the WEPP and the amounts owing under the CLC were calculated using the same data."], ["[29]", "The referees' decisions are also consistent with the spirit of the legislative provisions in question. The WEPP and Part III of the CLC have different objectives. The WEPP seeks to provide financial help and support to employees who lose their jobs because their employer goes bankrupt, while Part III of the CLC establishes minimum employment standards and the dispute resolution mechanisms related to those standards. In this case, it would be contrary to the spirit of the CLC to put employees who received WEPP benefits in a situation where they could become Crown debtors because they received an overpayment from the directors."], ["[30]", "Needless to say, the payment orders under sections 251.1 and 251.18 of the CLC are mechanisms established to help employees, not the Minister of National Revenue.

{"id_": "001947", "body_str": [["[1]", "Roy, J.", ": This is an application for judicial review, in the nature of a prohibition order, brought by Les Laboratoires Servier and Servier Canada Inc. [Servier] pursuant to the", "Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations", ", SOR/93-133, as amended [", "NOC Regulations", "]. Servier Canada sells a 60 mg modified release [MR] gliclazide tablet in Canada under the name DIAMICRON MR, which is used in the treatment of diabetes. The respondent Apotex Inc. [Apotex] wishes to sell a generic version of a 60 mg MR gliclazide tablet. The applicants seek to restrain the Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance [NOC] to Apotex until after Canadian Patent No. 2,629,670 [the '670 Patent] expires."], ["[2]", "For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that the application must be dismissed, with costs to Apotex.", "I.", "Introduction"], ["[3]", "Gliclazide, the active ingredient in the product under review, was discovered by Servier. It is not a new product. It is a hypoglycemic agent which helps maintain sugar levels in the blood of diabetic patients by releasing insulin."], ["[4]", "Originally, Servier produced an 80 mg tablet with immediate release [IR], which produced a high concentration of gliclazide in the plasma in a short-term fashion. That tablet was breakable."], ["[5]", "A second formulation was developed. It ended up being non-breakable, contrary to the 80 mg tablet, but it had a modified release. It is available in a 30 mg dosage."], ["[6]", "The advantage of MR is that it is meant to avoid the high and short-lived concentration of an active ingredient in the blood. Compared to IR, it reduces \"peak effects\". The '670 Patent uses the terms \"modified release\" and \"prolonged release\". (The '670 Patent under review was written in French. The parties referred to an English version produced on behalf of Apotex and used it throughout the proceedings. It has not been challenged. The original French version of the '670 Patent speaks of \"libération modifiée du principe actif\" and \"libération prolongée\".)"], ["[7]", "The '670 Patent seeks to claim a new formulation that covers the 60 mg gliclazide MR divisible tablet. Servier argues that its patent is limited to the 60 mg dosage, while Apotex counters that there is no such limitation. The tablet is breakable."], ["[8]", "According to the patent, there are three components to the tablet: the active pharmaceutical ingredient (gliclazide), a cellulose derivative and a binder, which are all physical characteristics of the tablets. The patent claims that the whole tablet as well as a fraction of a whole tablet will have an \"identical dissolution profile\". Claim 1 speaks of an \"identical dissolution profile\" (\"profil de dissolution identique\") while claim 15 speaks in terms of \"similar dissolution profile\" (\"profil de dissolution similaire\")."], ["[9]", "Apotex argues that its tablets do not contain a binder. Furthermore, its tablets would not show an identical dissolution profile as defined by the patent where one compares the whole tablet to the fraction obtained once the tablet is broken. Thus, the '670 Patent is not infringed according to Apotex because two of the essential elements are different."], ["[10]", "The prohibition order sought in these proceedings will not issue if Apotex is successful on any of its allegations that it does not infringe the monopoly granted through the patent. If Apotex's tablet and a fraction thereof do not have identical dissolution profiles, its product is not covered by the patent and, therefore, it does not infringe the '670 Patent. Similarly, if the Apotex product does not have a binder, as required by the patent, it could not be said that there is infringement. In those circumstances, it does not matter that the '670 Patent would be valid or not since there would not be any infringement."], ["[11]", "However, Apotex argues also that the patent, as framed, is invalid. If that is the case, it would evidently be impossible to infringe on an invalid patent. Either way, Servier cannot be successful because there is no infringement or the patent is invalid."], ["[12]", "Thus Apotex alleges that the '670 Patent is not valid because the subject matter defined by a claim is obvious to the skilled person. Similarly, the patent had to disclose an invention that is new and useful (definition of \"invention\", section 2 of the", "Patent Act", ", RSC, 1985, c P-4). It did not. For good measure, Apotex also argues that the patent is invalid because it lacks specificity (subsections 27(3) and (4) of the", "Patent Act", ") as well as being overbroad and ambiguous. These other arguments are largely presented in the alternative to arguing invalidity on the bases of obviousness and utility.", "II.", "The Parties"], ["[13]", "Servier is a \"first person\" as described in the", "NOC Regulations", ". It received a NOC from the Minister of Health on September 9, 2010 to sell its 60 mg MR gliclazide tablets in Canada under the registered trade-mark DIAMICRON MR.

He is one of the named inventors and is located in Europe. Dounia Maizi is Servier's Chief of Regulatory Affairs in Canada. This witness was offered as an expert with regard to the regulatory process that Servier and Apotex had to follow in order to get approval from the regulator, Health Canada. She also testified as to her understanding of the construction of the patent. Because Apotex's product must be bioequivalent with that of Servier's in order to get regulatory approval, Ms. Maizi states that \"ce qui veut nécessairement dire que le comprimé entier de 60 mg du produit d'Apotex est un comprimé sécable à libération prolongée qui dans sa forme non subdivisée, possède un profil de dissolution in vivo identique à chacun des demis-comprimés de 30 mg de sorte qu'il existe une forte similarité entre la biodisponibilité du produit d'Apotex avec le produit DIAMICRON® MR 60 mg de Servier\" (para 71 of the affidavit of Dounia Maizi of September 13, 2013)."], ["[19]", "Apotex took issue with Ms. Maizi's testimony as she is an employee of the first person. Relying on the Code of Conduct for Expert Witnesses (SOR/2010-176, section 13 (Schedule)), Apotex argues that the expert must be independent and objective (section 2). Ms. Maizi is not and declares that she wishes her employer prevail in these proceedings: indeed she is an officer of Servier. Pursuant to Rule 52.2(2) of the", "Federal Courts Rules", ", SOR/98-106, the failure to comply with the Code of Conduct may be sanctioned by the exclusion of some or all of the expert's affidavit."], ["[20]", "It seems to me that the Federal Court of Appeal's statement in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED is apposite:"], ["[41] In fact, there is a further weakness in the evidence of the affiants: at the time of swearing her affidavit, Ms. Murphy was a senior officer of Astra Pharma Inc., one of the Appellants to this action and, as a result her \"opinion\" evidence could be viewed as biassed or self-serving statements of an interested party."], ["[21]", "However, I would not reject the evidence of Ms. Maizi altogether. Her evidence, on the regulatory process at Health Canada, to the extent it is relevant in these proceedings, may not in fact require any expertise other than that of someone familiar with the applicable regulations. I observe that Apotex has offered the testimony of Duane Terrill, an employee, for a similar purpose. He did not testify as an expert. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Maizi concerning the construction that should be put on the '670 Patent, I would find her evidence much more suspicious. Although it is true that my colleague Tremblay-Lamer J. found in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, that, in the circumstances of that case, employees of the party could testify in an expert capacity, she was careful to note that they had \"testified in a straightforward and competent manner, and I did not detect any bias in either experts' testimony.\" More caution is needed in our case, where the employee is in fact an officer at Servier and has readily conceded that she wishes to see Servier prevail in this proceeding (cross-examination of Ms. Maizi, question 38). It follows that her testimony on the patent construction carries little weight."], ["[22]", "Servier presented two other witnesses, Dr. Bodmeier and Dr. Marroum, whose expertise and ability to testify as experts I would not question. One, Dr. Roland Bodmeier, is a professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Technology at the Freie Universität Berlin, in Germany. He declares to have focused his research on innovative drug delivery systems with special emphasis on controlled drug release and holds a Ph.D. in pharmaceutics. The other, Dr. Patrick John Marroum, obtained his Ph.D. in pharmacy and spent a large portion of his career with the US Food and Drug Administration where he \"worked to identify issues considered to be crucial to the determination of safety and efficacy of a drug product\" (para 3, affidavit of Dr. Marroum). His studies were in the area of pharmaceutics (the science of preparing dosage forms) and pharmacokinetics which studies the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of drugs."], ["[23]", "The Court was invited to accept with caution the evidence of experts Marroum and Bodmeier. It was said that Dr. Bodmeier was not straightforward in cross-examination, perhaps to the point of truculence. As for Dr. Marroum, it was argued that his qualifications should not allow him to opine in matters of formulation design."], ["[24]", "In my view, there is no reason to consider the opinions of these experts with caution on the basis of the arguments put forward by Apotex. I am satisfied that both are experts. These experts testified in cross-examination as is generally expected of experts: they do not change their view readily on cross-examination in spite of skilful attempts by adept counsel. As was put tactfully in", "Phipson on Evidence", "(JH Buzzard, R May& MN Howard, eds,", "Phipson on Evidence", ", 13th ed (London, UK: Sweet& Maxwell Ltd, 1982)):", "It is proverbial that they [experts] are, perhaps unwillingly, biased in favour of the side which calls them, as well as over-ready to regard neutral facts as confirmation of preconceived theories: moreover support or opposition to given hypotheses can generally be multiplied at will. (Para 27-35.)"], ["[25]", "Furthermore, both these witnesses have sterling academic credentials and significant experience in their field. If there is a distinction to be made between the experts presented by Apotex and those presented by Servier, it could be on the basis of the information provided to each set of experts, where the experts offered by Servier appear to have received more information about the issues in the proceedings than the experts offered by Apotex. More than 30 years ago, Lord Wilberforce observed in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED):", "While some degree of consultation between experts and legal advisers is entirely proper, it is necessary that expert evidence presented to the court should be, and should be seen to be, the independent product of the expert, uninfluenced as to form or content by the exigencies of litigation. To the extent that it is not, the evidence is likely to be not only incorrect, but self-defeating."], ["[26]", "Of course, experienced legal advisers will avoid that pitfall. Where the evidence in-chief of a witness presents elements of tailoring, consciously or not, coming from an honest witness, to support the side that has hired him, the weight to be given to that evidence will be negatively affected."], ["[27]", "As I will explain further later, the evidence of Dr. Marroum, however, must be discounted in some areas because he would have crossed the line between what can be expected of experts and an advocate for a product. Portions of his affidavit were more argumentative than informative. In", "The Law of Evidence in Canada", "(Alan W Bryant, Sidney N Lederman & Michelle K Fuerst,", "Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada", ", 3rd ed (Markham, ON: LexisNexis, 2009)), the authors remind us that experts are expected to provide independent assistance to the Court:", "§12.134 The expert witness should provide independent assistance to the court and should not assume the role of an advocate. An expert should state the facts or assumptions upon which his or her opinion is based and should not omit to consider material facts which weaken his or her opinion."], ["[28]", "In fact, the experts offered by Apotex were not challenged by Servier in that fashion. Dr. Reza Fassihi, who holds a Ph.D. in pharmaceutics, is a professor in that area of expertise at Temple University, in Philadelphia. As for Dr. Ping Lee, the second expert offered by Apotex, he holds a Ph.D. in pharmaceutics and teaches at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Toronto. While Dr. Bodmeier and Dr. Marroum were provided with the NOA, which would give them a good understanding of the issues that were to be litigated, Dr. Fassihi and Dr. Lee, according to their affidavits, were asked to consider the '670 Patent without the benefit of the NOA and the nature of the proceedings for which they were retained. A close examination of the affidavits of Dr. Lee and Dr. Fassihi confirms that they were not provided information concerning Apotex's product, its composition or dissolution characteristics. That gave rise to Apotex's argument that experts offered by Servier reached results-oriented constructions. To put it in the words of counsel for Apotex, if a question is given \"blind\" to an expert, the suggestion is that his or her credibility is enhanced."], ["[29]", "The only other Apotex affiant who was challenged on cross-examination was Duane Terrill, the Associate Director for Regulatory Affairs at Apotex. He oversaw the preparation of the ANDS filed by Apotex in order to seek approval for its tablet.

It constitutes the statement of allegations, both factual and legal, in accordance with subsections 5(1)(b)(iii) and (iv) of the", "NOC Regulations", ".

It would appear that the parties agree that the NOA must be complete in the sense that the first person must be given the information that will allow a sufficient understanding of the case: what is the case to answer? It has not been alleged or argued that the NOA suffers from some infirmity."], ["[33]", "Servier, on the other hand, suggests that Apotex raised for the first time late in the process, in its experts' affidavits, its so-called manufacturing theory according to which its tablet holds together through direct compression, thus avoiding the need for a binder. This Court, in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, noted again that the second person must raise the facts and legal arguments it wishes to raise in the NOA. New arguments, facts, allegations not set out in the NOA cannot be raised later. The goal posts cannot be moved. Hughes J. put it succinctly:"], ["[36] As matters stand now, the Court must reject arguments based on facts or documents not set out in the Notice of Allegation nor can the Court address new allegations."], ["[34]", "The Court is invited to disregard that theory."], ["[35]", "Apotex counters that once an issue has been put into play by the second person, it must be allowed to respond to the patentee's arguments, without having \"to anticipate every theory of possible infringement, however speculative, in the detailed statement supporting its allegations\" (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). In the case at hand, Apotex put in play the issue of the binder, which is one of the essential elements of the Servier invention claimed by Apotex to be absent in his product. As the Federal Court of Appeal put it in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED:"], ["[16] The Applications Judge erred in his formulation of the legal test to determine whether Novopharm's NOA was deficient when he required Novopharm to 'put into play' all aspects of the non-infringement issue. Whether Novopharm's NOA was adequate depends on whether it provided Pfizer with a sufficient understanding of the case it had to meet (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED). The legal test of adequacy does not require Novopharm to anticipate all possible grounds of infringement, including Pfizer's speculative theory that the dihydrate could be used in the process of manufacturing Novopharm's bulk monohydrate. As noted by Evans J.A. in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED:", "A second person [the generic] should not be required to anticipate every theory of possible infringement, however speculative, in the detailed statement supporting its allegations."], ["[36]", "Accordingly, Apotex argues that it must be allowed to explain how its tablet holds together, its so-called manufacturing theory."], ["[37]", "Whether or not Apotex can rely on its evidence with respect to how its tablet is manufactured appears to be the only significant difference between the parties about the NOA. The parties appear to agree that claim 14, concerned with a method for producing the tablet of any of claims 1 to 13, is not relevant in these proceedings and need not be considered any further."], ["[38]", "The parties have otherwise argued their case on the basis that the NOA puts the issues in play. Except for the issue of the existence of a binder, where Apotex has not indicated how its tablet holds together, there is no dispute that the NOA provided Servier with a sufficient understanding of the case it has to meet. Paraphrasing the Federal Court of Appeal in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED, the statement in the NOA is sufficiently detailed to make Servier fully aware of the grounds put forward by Apotex that its patent is invalid or that it has not been infringed. In my view, the NOA raised allegations of invalidity supported by evidence capable of establishing the invalidity of the patent: similarly, the allegations made by Apotex that it does not infringe the '670 Patent are in play."], ["[39]", "The NOA constructs the claims of the '670 Patent as requiring that there be a cellulose derivative that is different from the binder: these are two separate ingredients. One can read at page 8 of the NOA:", "The claimed tablet comprises gliclazide as the active ingredient, between 50% and 60% of the total weight of the tablet of a cellulose derivative, and a binder. The skilled person would understand what is meant by a cellulose derivative and a binder, and examples of these are provided in the 670 Patent. A skilled person would also understand from the context of the 670 Patent as a whole that the cellulose derivative is a separate and distinct component of the tablet from the binder so that two separate components of the tablet functions are the cellulose derivative and the binder. Given that claim 1 requires both a cellulose derivative and a binder, the skilled person would understand that the use of the terms independently and separately means that two distinct functional agents, a binder and a cellulose derivative, must be present in the tablet."], ["[40]", "Claims 1 and 10 require an identical dissolution profile (profil de dissolution identique) for the whole tablet and a fraction of it. Apotex complains that the conditions to use to conduct the dissolution test are not provided; similarly, how to assess the results in order to determine if there is a statistical difference is lacking. The hardness, coating, size, shape of the tablet, as well as the score line (the tablet must be scored as the tablet is said to be \"sécable\") receive no teaching in the patent."], ["[41]", "As to non-infringement of the patent, Apotex points that its product does not infringe the '670 Patent for two reasons. First, it argues that the evidence will show that the dissolution profile of its product is not identical, as the notion is defined in the disclosure, when comparing the whole tablet and fractions of it. Indeed, Apotex alleges that the dissolution profile is not similar (claim 15) either. Apotex goes on to state that if the method used to calculate the dissolution profiles of its product is challenged as inappropriate by Servier, it would allege that the patent is necessarily invalid because it would lack sufficiency, and thus would be in breach of subsection 27(3) of the", "Patent Act", ". \"If a specific dissolution method and/or statistical test is required to be used in order to assess whether a given tablet is within or outside the scope of the claims of the 670 Patent, this essential information was required to be disclosed within the specification in order to provide a full and correct description of the invention\" (pages 14-15 of the NOA). Indeed, the patent does not place any limitation on the methods of comparison or analysis."], ["[42]", "Second, Apotex argues that its product does not use a binder, contrary to the requirements of the '670 Patent with respect to claims 1 to 13 and 15. With respect more especially to claim 10, which is very precise as to the composition of the invention, the second person asserts that its tablet does not include some of the ingredients, which establishes non-infringement of claim 10, together with dependent claims 11 to 13. Similarly, claim 4 cannot be infringed because the binder is said to be maltodextrin, polyvidone or a hydroxypropylmethylcellulose [HPMC] of very low viscosity. Apotex does not use any of these substances according to the NOA. The same is said of claim 9 which requires the binder to be between 2% and 15% of the total weight of the tablet. Apotex's tablets not having a binder according to Apotex, that particular claim cannot be infringed."], ["[43]", "Apotex raises a number of issues leading to its contention that the '670 Patent is invalid. As already pointed out, it argued ambiguity if Servier were to counter that the method and analysis used by Apotex to establish that the dissolution profile of its product was not identical between their whole tablet and a fraction. Apotex also alleges obviousness. In essence, a person of skill in the art would have known that the purported invention is a scored, modified release tablet of gliclazide whose dissolution profile is identical to a subdivided fraction. Given the prior art, there was no inventiveness according to Apotex. Any difference between the state of the art, and the inventive concept would have been obvious."], ["[44]", "Apotex further argues that the patent lacked a demonstrated utility and that the promised utility was not soundly predicted. As an alternative argument, Apotex alleges that the specification of the '670 Patent was insufficient in that it did not provide the teaching needed to allow the person skilled in the art to put the invention into practice. (It is of course counterintuitive to argue obviousness and insufficiency. If it was that obvious, how can the specification be also insufficient such that the person skilled in the art would be able, using only the disclosure, to produce the invention? However, I can think of no reason why such an argument could not be made. At any rate, Apotex made the argument solely in the alternative.)"], ["[45]", "Finally, Apotex asserts in its NOA that the '670 Patent is overbroad. It is said that the claims overreach if they are not already invalid due to lack of utility. An inventor cannot claim more than what is disclosed or invented. Apotex dedicated three paragraphs of its 44-page NOA to the argument. Its Memorandum of Fact and Law presented the issue in two paragraphs and counsel for Apotex did not press the issue at the hearing; indeed he did not argue the point. I do not intend to address the issue.", "V.", "Burden"], ["[46]", "The validity of a patent is presumed (section 43 of the", "Patent Act", "). However, that early presumption can be rebutted once Apotex has made allegations supported by evidence that is capable of establishing invalidity. The issue is put in play. These passages of", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, present the state of the law and were specifically approved by Hughes J. in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED:"], ["[9] In my view, the burden on a respondent under the Regulations is an \"evidential burden\" - a burden merely to adduce evidence of invalidity. Once it has discharged this burden, the presumption of validity dissolves and the Court must then determine whether the applicant has discharged its legal burden of proof. I believe this is what is meant in those cases where the Court has stated that the respondent must put its allegations \"into play\". It must present sufficient evidence to give its allegations of invalidity an air of reality.", "..."], ["[12] To summarize, Pfizer bears the legal burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that Apotex's allegations of invalidity are unjustified. Apotex merely has an evidentiary burden to put its case \"into play\" by presenting sufficient evidence to give its allegations of invalidity an air of reality. If it meets that burden, then it has rebutted the presumption of validity. I must then determine whether Pfizer has established that Apotex's allegations of invalidity are unjustified. If Apotex does not meet its evidential burden, then Pfizer can simply rely on the presumption of validity to obtain its prohibition order."], ["[47]", "The burden then shifts onto the first person, Servier, that must establish that the allegations of invalidity are not justified. It is the civil burden of proof, the balance of probabilities, which must be met by the first person (see", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[48]", "Evidence evenly balanced between the parties will favour the second person: the prohibition order would not issue (see", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED", "supra", ")."], ["[49]", "It follows that it is Servier's burden to satisfy the Court, on a balance of probabilities and not merely on a tied score, that none of the invalidity allegations are justified."], ["[50]", "As for allegations of infringement of the patent, once again it is Servier that bears the burden of proof. As early as 1994, the Federal Court of Appeal made the point clearly in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED. We can read at page 319:", "Furthermore, since the Regulations clearly allow the Minister, absent a timely application under section 6, to issue a notice of compliance on the basis of the allegations in the notice of allegation, it would seem that on the hearing of such an application, at least where the notice has alleged non-infringement, the Court should start from the proposition that the allegations of fact in the notice of allegation are true except to the extent that the contrary has been shown by the applicant. In determining whether or not the allegations are \"justified\" (subsection 6(2)) the Court must then decide whether, on the basis of such facts as have been assumed or proven, the allegations would give rise in law to the conclusion that the patent would not be infringed by the respondent."], ["[51]", "More recently, the same point was made in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED:"], ["[20] In my view, this statement remains good law. Where, as here, the NOA is found to be adequate, the legal burden remains squarely on Pfizer to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the allegations in the NOA are unjustified.

As indicated earlier, Dr. Wüthrich provided fact evidence in these proceedings and was cross-examined."], ["[64]", "The specification of the '670 Patent, in its disclosure part, begins with a general description of the invention, at page 1:", "La présente invention s'inscrit dans le cadre de la recherche et de la mise au point de nouvelles formes galéniques de préparations pharmaceutiques. La présente invention concerne une forme galénique sécable permettant une libération modifiée du principe actif.", "The present invention falls within the context of the research and development of new dosage forms of pharmaceutical preparations. The present invention relates to a scored dosage form allowing modified release of the active ingredient."], ["[65]", "In other words, the disclosure announces an invention of limited scope. It says that the \"forme galénique\", i.e. the form a medicine can take (syrup, capsule, suppository, etc.) is scored, thus allowing modified release of the active ingredient. We are not concerned with a new medicine, the active ingredient being gliclazide which has been known for some time, but rather with the form in which it will be administered to and taken by patients."], ["[66]", "The '670 Patent then describes certain benefits associated with modified release drugs, particularly that undesirable and perhaps harmful elevated concentrations of the active ingredient are avoided in a patient's blood compared to immediate release. The specification also describes benefits associated with tablets that are, as written in the patent, \"sécable\". In the English translation of the patent provided by Apotex, the term \"sécable\" has been translated as \"scored\" although in the applicants' materials the term \"divisible\" is used instead. There does not appear to be any difference intended in the use of different words. The benefit of a scored or divisible tablet lies in permitting the manufacturing of a single tablet which can be later subdivided into different dosages. It is also said that there is a benefit for the patient by providing better treatment adherence as the 60 mg prolonged release scored tablet would limit the number of tablets a patient would have to take."], ["[67]", "The '670 Patent disclosure describes the difficulty in combining modified release properties with a tablet shape that is scored or divisible. However, it only cites a warning, issued by the European Medicines Agency [EMA] in 1999, against this combination except in exceptional cases, at page 2:", "C'est une mauvaise pratique de subdiviser les formes à libération prolongée mais cela pourrait être justifié dans des cas exceptionnels.", "It is bad practice to subdivide prolonged-release dosage forms but this may be justified in exceptional cases."], ["[68]", "Essentially, the difficulty described by the '670 Patent is that when a modified release tablet is divided, the surface area increases as the broken face is now exposed. This change in surface area alters the rate of dissolution of the active ingredient in the tablet. While tablets can be designed with deep scoring grooves to minimize the increase in surface area after division, the patent states that such tablets are prone to breaking too easily."], ["[69]", "Accordingly, the '670 Patent presents the purported invention to overcome the alleged problems it identified with the subdivision of modified release tablets, at page 3:", "La présente invention a donc pour but de proposer une stratégie alternative permettant de contourner les problèmes inhérents au développement de comprimés sécables à libération modifiée déjà disponibles, en vue de remédier, au moins en partie aux inconvénients liés à la subdivision des comprimés en dose fractionnaire.

This novel dosage form is characterized in that it has an identical dissolution profile whether or not it has been subdivided. For example, the prolonged-released scored tablet in its non-subdivided form and a fraction of said form obtained by subdivision have an identical dissolution profile."], ["[70]", "It is therefore announced that in order to bypass problems caused by the subdivision of tablets, it is the pharmaceutical composition of the dosage form that will address the issue."], ["[71]", "The disclosure sets out what is meant by \"profil de dissolution identique / identical dissolution profile\" in the context of the claimed invention, at page 4:", "Dans le contexte de l'invention on entend par « profil de dissolution identique » des cinétiques de dissolution ayant des coefficients de variations sans différence statistiques entre eux.

As previously mentioned, gliclazide is used in the treatment of diabetes. Indeed, claim 1, which defines the monopoly sought, speaks of gliclazide as being the active ingredient. Claims 10 and 15 make the same limitation. The '670 Patent describes the two prior formulations of gliclazide: an 80 mg immediate-release tablet and a 30 mg prolonged- and controlled-release matrix tablet. The patent claims that the invention at issue compares advantageously with these prior formulations."], ["[74]", "As noted, the claimed invention requires two excipients to be included in the formulation alongside gliclazide: a cellulose-derived polymer and a binder."], ["[75]", "The patent describes the function of the cellulose-derived polymer, at pages 5 to 6:", "Dans la formule, le polymère dérivé de cellulose a pour fonction de former la matrice assurant, entre autre, la libération modifiée du principe actif.

One of the named low-viscosity HPMCs is Methocel K100 LV™, which has a viscosity of 100 cP."], ["[77]", "Similarly, the disclosure sets out the role of the binder in the invention as the following, at page 7:", "Dans la composition pharmaceutique selon l'invention le liant sert à agglutiner entre elles les particules qui ne peuvent l'être sous la seule action de la pression", "In the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention, the binding serves to agglutinate together the particles which cannot be agglutinated under the action of pressure alone."], ["[78]", "Like with the cellulose-derived polymer, the patent sets out preferred binders for the invention, one of which is an HPMC of a very low molecular weight."], ["[79]", "Thus, a pattern can be discerned in the presentation of the disclosure. It advises that there are three essential elements, the active ingredient (gliclazide), a cellulose derivative and a binder. This novel dosage form (\"nouvelle forme galénique\") has the further characteristic of having an identical dissolution profile, whether it is subdivided or not. For each of those elements, the disclosure gives a definition: the patent defines its own terms when dealing with its essential elements."], ["[80]", "There are 15 claims in the patent. Servier asserts infringement of claims 1 to 6, 8, and 11 to 13. Claim 7 is concerned with a particular binder, maltodextrin, which is not part of the composition of the Apotex tablet. Claim 9 requires a particular percentage of the weight of the tablet to consist of a binder. Claim 10 provides precise percentages of ingredients, including the essential ingredients including 6.9% of the total weight consisting of the binder maltodextrin. At the hearing, Servier announced that it was not asserting anymore infringement of claim 15 for a number of reasons that were not revealed."], ["[81]", "That leaves us with the other claims being discussed in this case. Claim 1 deals with a prolonged release tablet which is scored. It is stated that it is comprised of gliclazide, a cellulose derivative that is 50% to 60% of the total weight and a binder. There is then the requirement that the tablet in its non-divided form have an identical dissolution profile (\"profil de dissolution identique\") as would have a fraction produced by subdivision. Claims 2 and 3 depend on claim 1. Claim 2 identifies cellulose derivatives, including HPMC which is identified specifically at claim 3 in its low viscosity variety. Such is the logic of the cascading claims: claim 1 identifies the four essential elements and claims 2 and 3 deal with one of these essential elements, the cellulose derivative. Having identified three cellulose derivatives in claim 2, the inventor identifies HPMC of low viscosity as the cellulose derivative in claim 3. The NOA notes that no definition of low viscosity is provided in the patent. However, I note that the disclosure identifies a number of HPMCs having high, medium and low viscosity."], ["[82]", "The next cascading claim is claim 4 which addresses the binder needed in the patent. It identifies three binders, before selecting in particular one of the three binders as maltodextrin at cascading claim 7. However, claim 4 also identifies as a binder HPMC of very low viscosity as a possible binder. As with HPMC of low viscosity, the patent does not define \"very low viscosity\". While the disclosure identifies products of low viscosity, there is no such identification for what could be very low-viscosity HPMC. The reader is left in the dark."], ["[83]", "Claims 5 and 6 state that the tablet comprises a hydrophylizing agent, which is spelled out as being colloidal silica."], ["[84]", "Claim 8 states that gliclazide comprises 12% to 40% of the total weight of the tablet, while claim 9 states that the binder weighs between 2% and 15% of the total weight of the tablet."], ["[85]", "Claim 10 is much more precise than the cascading claims examined previously. It states that the tablet is comprised of 18.7% of gliclazide, 22.3% of lactose monohydrate, 6.9% of maltodextrin, 0.5% of magnesium stearate, 1.6% of anhydrous colloidal silica and 50% of HPMC. The claim speaks of a scored tablet which produces a modified release with a dissolution profile said to be identical whether the tablet is subdivided or not. Obviously, as with other claims dealing with a binder, Apotex's product cannot infringe claim 10 because it does not contain 6.9% of its weight in maltodextrin."], ["[86]", "Claim 11 simply requires that the tablet have one or more scores, or grooves, that will be perpendicular to its height and length. The grooves are said to be breakable (\"rainures de ruptures\")."], ["[87]", "Claim 12 addresses the dissolution profile of the tablet: within the first two hours, 13% to 27% of the active ingredient, gliclazide, will have been released; 32% to 52% of the total quantity of gliclazide will be released within four hours and 85% will have been released within 12 hours."], ["[88]", "Claim 13 states that claims 1 to 12 are intended for a product that treats diabetes. Claim 14 speaks of methods for producing the tablet."], ["[89]", "Finally, claim 15 speaks again of a modified release tablet of gliclazide, including a cellulose derivative comprising 50% to 60% of the tablet's total weight and a binder. However, while claims 1 and 10 speak of identical dissolution profiles whether one has the whole tablet or a fraction of it, claim 15 speaks in terms of a similar dissolution profile,", "in vitro", ", for a period of 12 hours following the start of dissolution. This is the only claim that posits a time period. The second person notes in its NOA that there is no explanation as to what is meant by \"similar\" (\"similaire\").

Under the heading \"Example 1: Dissolution kinetics\" the patentee asserts that \"[t] his example compares the", "in vitro", "release kinetics of non-subdivided tablets and of fractional doses according to the invention.\" The example goes on to show that the", "in vitro", "dissolution profiles satisfy the so-called f2 similarity factor, which is a mathematical equation, that measures the variation between release profiles.

At various places in their affidavits, both Dr. Marroum (see, for example paragraphs 21, 84-85, 87, 105 and 111) and Dr. Bodmeier (see, for example, paragraphs 17, 86-88, 109 and 123) provide the opinion that the identical dissolution profile in claims 1 and 10 relates to an", "in vivo", "dissolution profile or bioequivalency. This interpretation of the claims is surprising given that there is no", "in vivo", "testing described in the 670 Patent. Rather, the single dissolution study that is reported in the 670 Patent was conducted", "in vitro", ". It is also stated in the 670 Patent (see page 5) that the identical", "in vitro", "dissolution kinetics according to the invention give identical plasma kinetics. In the 670 Patent (see pages 4-5), \"identical dissolution profile\" is defined as meaning dissolution kinetics with no statistical difference between them, and the only dissolution kinetics provided in the 670 Patent are found in Example 1 (and Figure 1).

Furthermore, the interpretation conforms with the plain words used by the patentee:", "77. This issue is complicated by the fact that claim 15 refers to a \"similar dissolution profile\". While the meaning of a \"similar\" dissolution profile is not described in the remainder of the 670 Patent, this is a term that the skilled person would understand in the context of dissolution profiles. One of the common statistical tests for comparing two dissolution profiles is the similarity factor test, or f2, which compares the amount of material dissolved between a test sample (for example, the subdivided tablet) and a reference sample (for example, the whole tablet) at different time points. If the value calculated for f2 is between 50 and 100, the dissolution profiles are considered to be similar. This allows for an approximate 10% variance in dissolution between two sets of dissolution data at each time point (f2 = 50). If the value calculated for f2 is less than 50, the dissolution profiles are considered not to be similar.", "78. Absent a different explanation in the 670 Patent, it is my opinion that the skilled person would adopt this understanding of the term \"similar dissolution profile\" in claim 15. While an f2 value of 100 would represent \"identical\" dissolution values, the skilled person would understand that this is an impractical standard and could not be what the inventors had intended when they refer to an \"identical dissolution profile\". Therefore, the skilled person would understand that \"identical dissolution profile\" in claim 1 must be referring to something that is more than \"similar\" (an f2 value of greater than 50) but less than absolutely \"identical\" (and f2 of less than 100). However, the skilled person would not know exactly what this difference was intended to be."], ["[111]", "Both Dr. Lee and Dr. Fassihi gave interpretations that sought to account for the written words, as defined in the disclosure, and for claim 15. Their interpretation is in my view more persuasive than adding words in the definition the patentee chose to give and ignore the sole example given which refers to", "in vitro", "dissolution profiles. Dr. Fassihi gave an opinion which has the merit of acknowledging the difficulties inherent in the language used by the patentee:", "85. However, this understanding of the phrase \"identical dissolution profile\" in independent claims 1 and 10 of the 670 Patent is complicated by the fact that there is a reference to a \"similar dissolution profile\" in claim 15. There is no doubt that the skilled person would understand a \"similar dissolution profile\" as used in claim 15 to refer to an f2 similarity factor of greater than 50. What is not clear is whether the inventors intended the phrase \"identical dissolution profile\" to mean the same as the phrase \"similar dissolution profile\", or whether the phrase \"identical dissolution profile\" is meant to refer to a dissolution profile that is more similar than a \"similar dissolution profile\" (that is, an f2 value that is somewhat greater than 50), or whether the inventors intended the phrase \"identical dissolution profile\" to mean that some other statistical test was to be used.", "86. Therefore, while it is not clear exactly what the inventors intended to mean with their use of the term \"identical dissolution profile\" in independent claims 1 and 10, it is my opinion that the skilled person would understand that the inventors likely intended that this would refer to dissolution profiles where the f2 value was at least 50, but most likely something closer to the upper end of 50-100. As noted above, the skilled person would understand a \"similar dissolution profile\" to refer to dissolution profiles having an f2 value of 50 or greater."], ["[112]", "Thus, the applicant has not discharged its burden that the identical dissolution profile requires", "in vivo", "dissolution kinetics in the eyes of the POSITA.

In essence, Servier contends that HPMC can be both a cellulose derivative and a binder. It must be noted, however, that the cellulose derivative would preferably be of low viscosity ('670 Patent, page 8 and claim 3). Indeed, the Servier product uses HPMC 100 cP, which is described in the specification as a low-viscosity HPMC. Conversely, the binder is presented as being preferably a number of substances (", "inter alia", "glucose, sucrose, maltodextrin, polyvidone and HPMC of very low viscosity).

When, as part of the disclosure at page 9, the inventor offers a further preference, it is for \"maltodextrin, polyvidone or an HPMC of very low molecular weight.\""], ["[117]", "Claim 4, which deals with the binder, speaks of three possible excipients: maltodextrin, polyvidone and HPMC of very low viscosity. In the disclosure, HPMC is referenced as a possible binder, but it would have to be either of very low viscosity or very low molecular weight. In spite of that Servier argues that the binder can be the HPMC of low viscosity."], ["[118]", "Servier relies on the testimonies of its two experts, Dr. Bodmeier and Dr. Marroum, for its view that the POSITA would accept that the binder may be HPMC of low to very low viscosity (Memorandum of Fact and Law, para 34). In so doing, Servier appears to seek support in one of the three preferred combinations found after the paragraphs on page 9 that speak of \"an HPMC of very low viscosity\" and \"an HPMC of very low molecular weight\". That paragraph evidently deals with the third essential element. It reads:", "La présente invention concerne donc de préférence un comprimé sécable à libération prolongée comprenant: a) du gliclazide, un dérivé de cellulose, de la maltodextrine ou b) du gliclazide, un dérivé de cellulose, de la polyvidone ou c) du gliclazide, un dérivé de cellulose, une HPMC de faible à très faible poids moléculaire.", "The present invention therefore preferably relates to a prolonged-release scored tablet comprising: a) gliclazide, a cellulose derivative, maltodextrin or b) gliclazide, a cellulose derivative, polyvidone or c) gliclazide, a cellulose derivative, an HPMC of low to very low molecular weight."], ["[119]", "I would not hold against the applicant that it speaks in its factum of low to very low viscosity, instead of low to very low molecular weight. Rather, the issue is that the specification speaks in terms that forcefully suggest that the binder will be a different excipient than the cellulose derivative which forms \"the matrix providing, inter alia, the modified release of the active ingredient.\" The patent is careful to speak of", "an", "HPMC of very low molecular weight. It also states that the HPMC, in order to be a binder, will be of very low viscosity both in the disclosure and claim 4. This helps confirm that if the binder is to be HPMC, it has to be a different HPMC than that forming the cellulose derivative."], ["[120]", "I am comforted in this conclusion by the fact that nothing in the specification teaches that the cellulose derivative and the binder can be one and the same. Indeed, the applicant does not explain how the same HPMC would be capable \"to agglutinate together the particles which cannot be agglutinated under the action of pressure alone\". What part of HPMC of low viscosity (as opposed to very low viscosity) can serve to agglutinate the particles without being under the action of pressure alone was never explained? Servier tries to take advantage of three words (\"low to very\") in a paragraph in the disclosure after having stated clearly that the binder could be HPMC if it is either of very low viscosity or very low molecular weight. It seems to me that the balance of probabilities favours that the POSITA would understand that the patent requires that the binder be a different excipient that, if it is to be HPMC, would have to be an HPMC of very low viscosity (or of very low molecular weight). To paraphrase Pratte J.A. in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "supra", ", it is not for the Court to redraft claims. When claims are written to state four essential elements, and the specification is written to identify a binder as a different element, it will not be possible to construct the claims as allowing two of the essential elements to be the same, but with different properties unless, somehow, the party seeking that construction convinces the Court that the patent teaches that much. Here the applicant has failed to meet that burden. Its reliance on three words, in the face of other statements in the specification and the gist of it will be not sufficient to reverse the tide."], ["[121]", "It follows that the '670 Patent must be constructed as having the following essential elements:", "a) an active ingredient: gliclazide;", "b) a cellulose derivative (50% to 60% of the total weight of the tablet);", "c) a binder which will be an excipient other than the cellulose derivative, but could be an HPMC of very low viscosity (or very low molecular weight);", "d) the subdivided tablet will have an identical", "in vitro", "dissolution profile to that of the undivided tablet."], ["[122]", "It is understood that the prolonged-release tablet is scored, or grooved.", "VIII.", "Infringement"], ["[123]", "Apotex alleges that it does not infringe the '670 Patent because its tablet does not contain a binder and its testing has not shown", "in vitro", "dissolution profiles that would be identical for undivided and subdivided tablets."], ["[124]", "The law is clear. \"There is no infringement if an essential element is different or omitted\" (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED). Furthermore, on an application for a prohibition order, it is the applicant's burden, as we have seen, to satisfy the Court that its patent has been infringed. In the case at hand, that means that Servier must demonstrate that Apotex's product contains a binder and the", "in vitro", "dissolution profiles are identical. For the reasons that follow, Servier has failed to discharge its burden.", "A.", "Infringement: binder"], ["[125]", "In order to show that Apotex's product contains a binder, Servier must argue that the fact that it contains HPMC, which is a listed binder that meets the definition of binder found in the disclosure, is sufficient. That argument falls short of the mark."], ["[126]", "As already shown, the specification requires that an HPMC has to be of very low viscosity to act as a binder. The specification already establishes that the HPMC used in the claimed invention is one of low viscosity.", "[Redacted]"], ["[127]", "[Redacted", "], Apotex offered expert evidence, which was not successfully contradicted, about its manufacturing process. Without getting into the details of the manufacturing process, suffice it to say that the weight of the evidence is to the effect that the use of the HPMC of low viscosity is to form the prolonged-release matrix. To quote from the affidavit of one of Apotex's experts, Dr. Fassihi, \"[a] ll of the HPMC used in the Apo-Gliclazide tablets would have the same function, that is, forming the prolonged-release matrix\" (para 113). The witness goes on to state at paragraph 223 of his affidavit:", "223. In the Apo-Gliclazide tablets, binding is provided by mechanical means alone, that is, the force of compaction on the mixed ingredients. In the 670 Patent, the presence of the binder is to agglutinate together the particles which cannot be agglutinated under the action of pressure alone. Contrary to the tablets of the 670 Patent, the particles of the Apo-Gliclazide tablets can be agglutinated under pressure alone, and therefore a binder is not required."], ["[128]", "Dr. Fassihi was not shaken on cross-examination. In fact, it was quite the opposite. An exchange between Dr. Fassihi and counsel for Servier will illustrate the point:", "394 Q. Yes. Turn to page 11; you see the title at the top says \"Formulation with Methocel\"?", "A. Yes.", "395 Q. It says direct compression.", "A. Yes.", "396 Q.

It says:", "\"When working with a directly compressible system it is simple to add Methocel products in dry powder form.\"", "You see that?", "A. Again, you are using the word Methocel as a general term. We need to be very specific because you just now showed me on page 7 a list of Methocel products in Table 1. There are close to 20 Methocels and maybe a couple of them are used as a binder which have very low viscosity and very low molecular weight, but everything else is specific for matrix formers. So I just want to be sure that we understand when they use the word Methocel we need to define it because we have 20 different Methocels. What are we talking about? What Methocel? So that has to be clear."], ["[129]", "And later on:", "400 Q. It says Methocel K. It doesn't specify which one of them.", "A. That's exactly what I'm talking about because you have Methocel K which is 100,000, 50,000, 4,000. And just keep in mind in the patent, page 9 of the 670 Patent, binder serves to agglutinate together the particles which cannot be agglutinated under the action of pressure. So here this is direct compression. So you are talking about pressure here. The patent doesn't talk about pressure. The patent talks about materials that cannot be agglutinated under pressure. So this is direct compression."], ["[130]", "In my view, the point is well taken. The binder under consideration in the patent is one that \"serves to agglutinate together the particles which", "cannot be agglutinated under the action of pressure alone", "\" (page 9 of the specification in its English translation; my underlining), not merely to compact the cellulose derivative. The issue is not so much whether HPMC can be a binder - it can, according to the evidence. But it must be of very low viscosity to act as the defined binder, which is a property the HPMC used in this case by Apotex does not have. Furthermore, the evidence is to the effect that there is no agglutination; rather, Apotex uses compression for its tablet."], ["[131]", "In an attempt to counterweight the evidence of Dr. Fassihi, the applicant put forth an affidavit in reply from Dr. Bodmeier. In a short affidavit, one can read the one paragraph which is apposite here:", "7. The Dow publication (1982, NOA Exhibit #5) states that a matrix of Methocel can be tableted by direct compression, with compression granulations, or with conventional wet granulation (page 3, second column, last paragraph). On pages 11-12 of the document, the manufacturer explains that the direct compression (i.e. when HPMC is used as dry powder) or wet granulations are possible with HPMC. Therefore, HPMC can act as binder even if it is used in a dry granulation process such as the one used by Apotex."], ["[132]", "This paragraph falls short of rebutting Dr. Fassihi's evidence. If it establishes that HPMC can act as a binder, this is not something new. Moreover, the paragraph does not purport to address the point that the agglutination we are concerned with is something other than under the action of pressure alone. Compression does not do: there must be agglutination of \"the particles which cannot be agglutinated under the action of pressure alone\", in the words of the disclosure. Holding in a single mass is one thing. Causing the agglutination, as required by the patent, is quite another. In a word, this evidence is of limited assistance and does not address squarely the strong evidence offered by Dr. Fassihi. That would not satisfy Servier's burden of justifying its contention that Apotex's tablet contains a binder as described in the specification."], ["[133]", "Faced with this evidence, Servier chose to mount an attack on the admissibility of this evidence. Basically, the applicant argues that the manufacturing evidence ought to have been disclosed in the NOA."], ["[134]", "Although Apotex counters that its NOA unequivocally states that its product did not employ a binder, it remains that nothing prevented the respondent from alleging further that it was using a different manufacturing process. The fact that it never has to disclose the manufacturing details (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED) before a confidentiality order is issued does not address fully the fact that it said nothing of its manufacturing process."], ["[135]", "A better argument, one that is decisive here, is that Apotex did not have to anticipate the position Servier chose to take.

Alcon had, therefore, every right to adduce Prof. Ross-Murphy's competing definition of \"gel\" as a defence. To conclude otherwise would be to strip a respondent in a section 5 proceeding of any ability to defend itself. It would also force a respondent first, to prophesy down which path an applicant will march in construing the patent so as to attack the NOA and second, predict what scientific evidence it will need to guard the ramparts. Such a process, however, would be inefficient and serve no purpose. In addition, because defining the word \"gel\" is a matter of patent construction and, as such, a necessary precursor to any discussion of non-infringement or validity, the applicants cannot now argue that they were unaware that it would rear its head.

Indeed, this was known as early as 1982, when a United States patent (Patent 4,353,887 or the '887 Patent) described a (and is entitled) \"[d] ivisible tablet having controlled and delayed release of the active substance\". The '887 Patent teaches that tablets can be scored and shaped so that, on breaking, the increase in surface area is limited. This is accomplished in the '887 Patent through the use of deep dividing grooves. For this to work, the active ingredient must also be uniformly distributed throughout the tablet. The '887 Patent sets out specific measurements and shape characteristics to achieve such a tablet. In the patent, it is said that \"the active substance release characteristics [of the subdivided fragments] differ, at most, insignificantly from those of the whole tablet\". Actually, Dr. Fassihi, one of Apotex's experts, calculated an f2 value of 61 for the whole and subdivided tablets (well above 50) using the dissolution data available in the '887 Patent."], ["[165]", "Before the claim date in 2008, the prior art included multiple papers in peer-reviewed and other prominent journals that discussed methods of overcoming the problems associated with divisibility in modified release tablets. A 1987 paper in", "Pharmaceutical Research", ", the official journal of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists, analyzed the dissolution profile data for split controlled release theophylline tablets; it concluded that while the halved tablets dissolved more quickly than the whole tablets, the difference in rates of dissolution was not significant enough to cause concern or require bioavailability studies. A 1997 paper published in the", "Annals of Pharmacotherapy", "examined the splitting and subsequent dissolution of unscored and scored methylphenidate tablets; its authors noted that, in the scored tablets, the differences in dissolution profiles were not great as between the whole and half tablet."], ["[166]", "In 2000, the", "Pharmazeutische Industrie", "published a paper which compared whole and half matrix-based modified release tablets with different scoring and breaking methods.

Isosorbide-5-mononitrate (marketed under the brand name Imdur) is an anti-angina medication with extended release properties and is scored (the matrix for this drug uses hydroxypropylcellulose, which is not the preferred polymer for use in the '670 Patent but is listed as a possible cellulose derivative). Aminophylline (marketed under the brand name Phyllocontin) is a bronchodilator in the form of a scored, sustained release tablet; it uses hydroxyethylcellulose which also is a cellulose derivative listed in the '670 Patent. Theophylline (marketed as Uniphyl) is another bronchodilator in the form of a scored, sustained release tablet also using hydroxyethylcellulose. The antibiotic marketed as Augmentin is a combination of amoxicillin and calvulanate potassium; it is a scored sustained release tablet with hypromellose and xanthan gum (which can be used for matrix formation). Metoprolol succinate (marketed as Toprol-XL) is a beta blocker sold in a scored, extended release tablet form.

Cumulatively, these pieces of art show that the formulation of divisible modified release tablets could be accomplished while achieving desired dissolution profile results by 2008."], ["[170]", "In the absence of persuasive contradictory evidence, I have to accept the evidence of Dr. Lee who stated in his affidavit at paragraph 179:", "179. By March 2008, it was well known to the skilled person that in order to have similar dissolution profiles for a whole and subdivided tablet, it was advisable to follow certain physical design rules that minimize the increase in surface area resulting from the breaking or splitting of the whole tablet. This is because drug release from the matrix of a controlled release tablet is directly related to the available surface area, and as a tablet is split, the total surface area increases. As a result, the skilled person would understand that the ingredients in the tablet and their amounts have little influence on this property of a tablet.

That demonstration has not been made on a balance of probabilities on this record. The attempt made by Servier to discount the prior art presented by Apotex was largely unsuccessful. The point of the matter was to show that prior to 2008, there existed a number of publications showing how a tablet can be broken in order to have identical or similar dissolution profiles, whether divided or undivided.

The criticism made of Application '435 came from Dr. Marroum who merely indicated that the Application \"does not present a formulation that is scored and when divided will present the release characteristics of the half compared to the whole\" (affidavit of Dr. Marroum, para 168). However, as already pointed out, the prior art on divisibility was already abundant by March 2008. The mosaic has already taken shape. Actually it is a mosaic that does not have that many pieces.

This exercise would not require any inventive ingenuity whatsoever since this principle was well known to the skilled person (as taught, for example, in the 887 Patent).

Accordingly, the tests Servier points to that are not referred to in the '670 Patent are not relevant for establishing demonstrated utility."], ["[217]", "If on the other hand we consider the promised utility as asserted by Apotex, I would have been inclined to find that one embodiment of the claims had been demonstrated. But is that sufficient?"], ["[218]", "While the '670 Patent includes results from a single", "in vitro", "dissolution test based on L0014022 (the single example included in the specification), this is not sufficient demonstrated utility in the patent claims. None of the asserted claims is limited to the specific tablet that was tested. While claim 10 and its dependent claims are limited to the same ingredient composition as L0014022, there are no limitations set as to the tablet shape, size, surface area, etc. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the testing conducted on the example lot and referred to in the patent demonstrates the dissolution properties, and therefore the invention's utility, across the entire spectrum of the claimed invention. Where some of the bodies falling within the claim have no utility (beyond a", "de minimis", "range), the claim fails (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, citing", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED).", "(3)", "Sound Prediction"], ["[219]", "The doctrine of sound prediction permits a patent to establish utility, even where that utility had not been fully verified as of the filing date. To be valid under this doctrine, a patent must provide a \"solid teaching\" of the claimed invention (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED). A patent whose predicted usefulness is based on \"misinformation, mere speculation or lucky guesses\" will not meet this standard (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[220]", "Sound prediction has three elements, all of which must be met when a patent relies on this doctrine for its validity:", "1) There must be a factual basis for the prediction;", "2) The inventor must have an articulable and \"sound\" line of reasoning from which the desired result can be inferred from the factual basis; and", "3) There must be proper disclosure.", "(See", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[221]", "Again, the perspective of the skilled worker at whom the patent is directed sets the standard against which these elements are measured. As stated by the Federal Court of Appeal in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED:", "[T]he factual basis, the line of reasoning and the level of disclosure required by the doctrine of sound prediction are to be assessed as a function of the knowledge that the skilled person would have to base that prediction on, and as a function of what that skilled person would understand as a logical line of reasoning leading to the utility of the invention."], ["[222]", "In my view, the claimed invention fails on all three elements, whether we direct our attention to the patent as asserted by Apotex or by Servier."], ["[223]", "The sole factual basis upon which the '670 Patent can rely is the single", "in vitro", "dissolution test using example L0014022, as discussed above. For the same reason this single test failed to support a demonstration of utility, this test does not provide an adequate factual basis for sound prediction across the breadth of the claimed monopoly or with respect to", "in vivo", "dissolution profiles. The patent specifically refers to this testing as an \"example\" of the invention and this single set of illustrative data does not support as large a claim as set out in the '670 Patent."], ["[224]", "There is no sound and articulated line of reasoning in the patent bridging the gap between the factual basis and the predicted utility (i.e., that all tablets falling within the claimed invention will exhibit the necessary dissolution profiles). It is true that the sufficiency of the line of reasoning is assessed in light of the abilities and aptitudes of the skilled person (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED asks \"whether the skilled person would accept the logic presented in the specification and derive from the sound prediction as a whole an expectation that the invention will provide the promised utility.\"). However, even with the skilled worker's extensive education and experience in drug formulation and evaluation, he or she cannot make a sound prediction where nothing is offered as a basis for such a prediction."], ["[225]", "Finally, and most importantly in my view, building upon the insufficiency of the factual basis and logical reasoning, there is no proper disclosure in the patent. When assessing this element of the doctrine of sound prediction, the Court is to \"determine whether the specification provides a full, clear and exact description of the nature of the invention and the manner in which it can be practised\" (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED; see also", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED). Where a prediction is made sound by tests, such as the clinical trials and additional", "in vitro", "tests pointed to by Servier, those tests must be disclosed in the patent (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). Once again, this patent discloses very little. Indeed, that will have been the main issue with the '670 Patent. After much deliberation and numerous examinations of the '670 Patent and the evidence proffered by the parties, I was left with the general impression that was played a game of hide-and-seek. Where the law required a full, clear, and exact description of the nature of the invention and most importantly the manner in which it can be practised in order to benefit from the bargain, the patent as written says very little and it cannot satisfy the burden. The Servier evidence did not elucidate sufficiently. Without proper disclosure, it cannot be said that the public is receiving their proper share in return for the patent and monopoly."], ["[226]", "Apotex abandoned at the hearing its argument about overbreadth.

Furthermore, the Court concludes that the allegations of invalidity for obviousness and utility are also justified."], ["[229]", "It follows that the application for an order of prohibition sought by the first person, Servier, must be dismissed, with costs in favour of Apotex."], ["[230]", "At the conclusion of the hearing, counsel for Apotex suggested that the parties might reach an agreement between themselves as to costs, prior to knowing the outcome of this application.

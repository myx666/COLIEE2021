The Ministerial Instructions are a means to provide for a triage of applications according to revised eligibility criteria, including the establishment of categories of applicants and quotas."], ["[6]", "On March 29, 2012, the Minister proposed an amendment to IRPA under Bill C-38. The amendment introduced in s 87.4."], ["[7]", "Shortly after Bill C-38 (which contained s 87.4) was introduced in Parliament, the Minister issued Operational Bulletin 400 instructing that as of March 29, 2012, processing should not commence or continue for a FSW visa application received before February 27, 2008 for which a selection decision had not been made before March 29, 2012."], ["[8]", "Operational Bulletin 400 was rescinded.

It therefore was complete before s 87.4 became legally effective. The Respondent's position is that since no final decision on the visa application itself was made, the application was terminated by law as of June 29, 2012.", "III.", "ANALYSIS"], ["[13]", "The real issue in this judicial review is whether a selection decision made before June 29, 2012 is sufficient to prevent termination by s 87.4 of the Applicant's visa application."], ["[14]", "The issue is primarily one of law, directed at the limits of the operation of the visa process and goes to the legal core of that process.

Section 87.4 is clear that meeting the selection criteria is but one of the requirements to secure a FSW visa. Compliance with all requirements applicable to the FSW class must be met. On the facts those requirements were not met on either March 29, 2012 or June 29, 2012."], ["[19]", "Further, s 87.4 is clearly intended to have retrospective effect. While there is an interpretative principle against retrospective or retroactive legislation, there is no absolute legal impediment to such legislation where the words clearly set out that intent. It is common in other legislation, such as income tax changes, that amendments be effective from the date the legislation is tabled in Parliament although Royal Assent may follow at a much later date."], ["[20]", "Retrospective legislation may create real or perceived inequities; however, where Parliament clearly lays out that intent, any issue of unfairness of the legislation is more properly addressed in the political/electoral process than the judicial process."], ["[21]", "The operation of s 87.4 was well described in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 86, at paras 26-28 and 42:", "26 It is common ground that the Applicant's application for permanent residence was made before 27 February 2008.", "27 It is also common ground that it was not \"before March 29, 2012... established by an officer, in accordance with the regulations, whether the Applicant meets the selection criteria, and other requirements applicable to\" the Federal Skilled Worker Class.", "28 This means that, in accordance with paragraph 87.4(1) of the Act, the Applicant's application for permanent residence in Canada has been terminated by act of Parliament.

The Applicant does not dispute this fact and he does not dispute that his application was made before the operative date. His argument is that, notwithstanding valid legislation that terminates his application, the Court can somehow use a", "nunc pro tunc", "order to grant him an order of mandamus for a skilled worker application that no longer exists because it has been terminated by act of Parliament. To grant such an order, in my opinion, and in the words of the Supreme Court of Canada in", "Trecothic Marsh", ", above, \"would clearly be overriding the statute and defeating the intention of the law-giver.\" It would amount to the Court extending its jurisdiction in opposition to the law and the clear intention of Parliament."], ["[22]", "There is no gap in the legislation regarding the operation of law between March 29, 2012 and June 29, 2012. If an applicant had complied with all visa requirements before June 29, 2012 and was entitled to a positive decision, that applicant would be governed by the \"old\" law. For those applicants who had not fully complied with the \"old\" legislation, any rights accrued to June 29, 2012 would be terminated effective March 29, 2012. As stated earlier, the result may be unfair in the view of many but that is the result that Parliament intended and specifically provided for."], ["[23]", "Lastly, I can find no breach of procedural fairness. There were delays in the processing of FSW applications while the Respondent determined how to proceed with pending applications. However, the Applicant has not established that \"but for\" these delays, all aspects of his visa application would have been completed and a positive decision ought to have issued before June 29, 2012.

A claim that a failure to decide a matter in a timely manner - a matter for which mandamus is the proper remedy - is not also a breach of procedural fairness."], ["[25]", "Further, the Applicant knew on June 21, 2012 that a positive selection decision did not mean that a visa would issue. In the letter giving instructions to obtain medical evidence, the Applicant was informed that the selection decision does \"not imply in any way that your application has been approved\". There is no basis for a claim of legitimate expectation.", "IV.", "CONCLUSION"], ["[26]", "In conclusion, the purpose and intent of the legislation was to expunge as of March 29, 2012 existing rights in pre-February 27, 2008 visa applications unless an applicant had fully complied on that date with the FSW visa requirements. The Applicant did not nor had he complied when s 87.4 came into effect on June 29, 2012.

If they are simply irrelevant and/or unnecessary to the issues raised in the pleadings, there will be a significant waste of effort and money on both sides if we move into the trial without addressing the points of concern now. In fact, the whole conduct and timing of the trial will be very different if the parties proceed on the understanding that the reports are admissible. The inevitable result of admitting the reports will, in all likelihood be that further adjournments to the trial will be necessary to allow the Crown and the Interveners the time it will take to address all of the matters that the Plaintiffs now seek to raise.

They show the Plaintiffs, once again, attempting to introduce evidence that puts the Crown's general conduct towards Aboriginal peoples in dispute.

This expansive approach only began to emerge at the time of the amendments proposed by the Plaintiffs in 2004, when Russell J. firmly rejected all attempts by the Plaintiffs to broaden the scope of the pleadings in a way that these reports contemplate. The Plaintiffs appear to think that the entire history of government-aboriginal relations in Canada is part of this law suit, but do not say how that history relates to the specific issues in this case, which are about the impugned provisions of the", "Indian Act", "that allegedly interfere unjustifiably with the Plaintiffs' rights to determine their own membership.

Such sovereignty necessarily entails the existence of the exclusive authority to determine their own membership."], ["[39]", "Dr. Martinez's reports support the Plaintiffs' claims to nationhood and the Crown's formal recognition of sovereignty through treaty.

Dr. Martinez's reports support the Plaintiffs' position because he concludes that Aboriginal nations who were parties to the Treaties of North America meet all of the four criteria of statehood."], ["[41]", "Dr. Martinez's reports will also help the Court to understand and consider the objectives and motivations of the parties who entered the treaties, as revealed by the political and economic context at the time. The Treaties of North America, as Dr. Martinez makes clear, cannot be viewed in isolation as a series of disjointed historical events, devoid of any unifying characteristics or context. Each treaty is an individual piece of a much larger historical puzzle which must be approached in the light of the broader perspectives of the European and Aboriginal signatories."], ["[42]", "The Plaintiffs also say that Dr. Martinez provides evidence concerning the \"overriding British policy of colonial expansion as the 'raison d'être' for the Treaties of North America\" and that \"the Treaties of North America were entered into at a time when the militaristic capacities of the parties was more or less in balance,\" and that \"in entering the Treaties of North America, the British Crown was motivated in large part by the need to 'legitimize' these lands against other nations vying for control of the same regions.\" This is, the Plaintiffs allege, all relevant and admissible \"for the purpose of assessing the historical objectives and motivations of the British Crown in entering into Treaties 7 and 8 with the Aboriginal Plaintiffs.\""], ["[43]", "The Plaintiffs also point out that the reports examine the extent to which the historical and legal relationships between European and indigenous peoples were influenced by the stereotypical and discriminatory ideas of the period. These ideas, in turn, came to be incorporated into Euro-centric laws and juridical institutions which progressively eroded traditional customary laws and practices. In other words, the reports provide advice on the legal impact of Euro-centrism. This is relevant, the Plaintiffs claim, not because of the discussion on international and domestic law, but to show \"the effect that Euro-centric juridical institutions have had upon historical Treaty relationships and the erosion of indigenous rights.\""], ["[44]", "Dr. Martinez's reports also provide the \"aboriginal perspective\" that the Court requires, and which Chief Justice Lamer emphasized in", "Van der Peet", "and", "Delgamuukw", ", to understand how the \"indigenous peoples of North America entered into treaty relationships based upon an understanding of themselves as sovereign nations,\" and further explain \"the unique relationship between indigenous peoples and their lands, and the extent to which this understanding impacted their approach to the Treaties.\""], ["[45]", "Dr. Martinez also addresses the difficulties faced by Aboriginal peoples in the treaty-making process because their treaty-making practices were totally oral in nature and there were no written documents. There is a remarkable consistency, the Plaintiffs say, \"amongst indigenous treaty parties around the world regarding their own understanding of the treaties, particularly treaty provisions which purport to cede jurisdiction over their lands and political institutions ... .\""], ["[46]", "The reports also examine the \"effects of treaties upon indigenous peoples and their general way of life.\""], ["[47]", "All in all, the Plaintiffs say that the reports clearly meet the relevancy and necessity requirements established in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .

Thereafter the question is one of weight. The evidence may carry much weight, little weight, or no weight at all. If error is to be made it should be on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion and our efforts in my opinion, consistent with the ever-increasing openness of our society, should be toward admissibility unless a very clear ground of policy or law dictates exclusion.\"", "Sovereignty and Nationhood"], ["[49]", "It is immediately apparent from the synopsis I have given above concerning the justifications offered by the Plaintiffs for Dr. Martinez's proposed expert evidence, that the Plaintiffs have travelled a long way since Mr. Henderson assured the Crown and told the Court in 1998 that \"we are not saying we have a right to self-government at large. That is not what this case is about.\" They have also come a long way from my own ruling in June 2004 (which dealt with new amendments to the pleadings), that disallowed amendments that attempted to enlarge the nature of the action and to introduce \"a new claim to self-determination\" and which raised allegations \"about first nations other than the Band.\""], ["[50]", "It also seems to me that the Plaintiffs have come a long way from the amendment they introduced into the pleadings in 2004, and which was allowed, to clarify and focus issues for the Court. That was the amendment to paragraph 11 of the Amended Fresh as Amended Statement of Claim dealing with the \"claimed right of the First Nation to govern itself with its own institutions, customary laws and traditions,\" and which tells us that \"The right at stake is the right to have and maintain societal relationships in accordance with traditional principles, laws, customs and practices, which include the right to determine who is a member.\""], ["[51]", "The reports of Dr. Martinez are being used by the Plaintiffs to a considerable extent to justify a general claim for autonomy as sovereign nations, who, as such, also have a right to determine who their members are and to justify this in the context of world history dealing with the relationships between colonial powers and aboriginal groups, or at least North American aboriginal groups. The Martinez reports were not prepared to assist the Court in dealing with the issues in this law suit. They were prepared by Dr. Martinez to assist the UN for the particular purpose that is set out in the reports themselves:", "\"It should also be borne in mind that the Special Rapporteur [Dr. Martinez] has identified the ultimate purpose of his mandate as offering elements towards the achievement, on a practical level, of the maximum promotion and protection possible, both in domestic and international law, of the rights of indigenous populations and especially of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, by means of creating new juridical standards, negotiated and approved by all the interested parties, in a process tending to contribute to the building of mutual trust based on good faith, mutual understanding of the other parties' vital interests, an deep commitment from all of them to respect the eventual results of the negotiations.\" (p. 269 at para. 292)."], ["[52]", "There are recommendations in the reports as to what government policy towards Aboriginal peoples ought to be and suggestions for new juridical standards.

If Dr. Martinez's reports were admitted as expert testimony in these proceedings, we would be into a very different law suit to the one contemplated by the pleadings."], ["[55]", "This is the kind of documentation that can be referred to in argument. It was prepared for the UN under its mandate and it is widely available."], ["[56]", "Its ultimate purpose, its obvious attempts to promote political sovereignty for Aboriginal peoples generally, and its failure (for obvious reasons) to address the specifics of this law suit in terms of the Plaintiffs, Treaties 7 and 8, and band membership, make it far too tenuous and unwieldy to be of assistance as expert evidence.", "North American Aboriginal Groups"], ["[57]", "The Plaintiffs told the Court in 1998 that \"The proposed formulation of the rights to be asserted by the Plaintiffs, and the application of the current law to those rights to be alleged by the Plaintiffs, remain sufficiently closely connected to the Plaintiffs' existing pleading that an additional second action is not necessary. Multiplicity of proceedings ought to be avoided.\""], ["[58]", "Without explaining how, or why, the position put forward by the Plaintiffs in 1998 has been reversed. The Plaintiffs' materials for this motion are very much about claims to full sovereignty and nationhood, and the membership right that was the focus in 1998 is now merely \"parasitic\" upon a much more ambitious assertion of general self-government. Dr. Martinez's reports, at bottom, are being enlisted to support this claim."], ["[59]", "Once again, as I said in my Reasons for the first motion, the Plaintiffs cannot have it both ways. If they had wanted to assert a claim to full sovereignty and nationhood they should have done so when they sought amendments to the pleadings so that the Crown could have responded as it saw fit, and the Court could have made decisions based upon the Plaintiffs' open and declared intentions. It is not appropriate to secure amendments by telling the Court \"we are not saying we have a right to self-government at large. That is not what this case is about,\" and then, on the eve of the trial, attempt to introduce voluminous evidence that makes these proceedings very much about \"self-government at large.\""], ["[60]", "If, as the Plaintiffs now say, this case is about sovereignty and nationhood, and the consequential right to determine membership that flows from sovereignty and nationhood, then it is, indeed, not \"sufficiently closely connected to the Plaintiffs' existing pleading.\" It is a totally different action and one that requires a legal process that has not been undertaken so far in these proceedings."], ["[61]", "So anything in Dr. Martinez's reports that supports, and invites the Court to find, a general right of sovereignty and nationhood, either for all First Nations peoples in Canada, or for the particular Plaintiffs in this case, is just not relevant because, as Mr. Henderson on behalf of the Plaintiffs has so unequivocally and succinctly put it, \"That is not what this case is about.\"", "Context and Specificity"], ["[62]", "The Plaintiffs also say they are seeking to introduce the reports and to call Dr. Martinez to provide the context required to understand the issues raised in the pleadings."], ["[63]", "Of course, I agree with the Plaintiffs, that a historical context is necessary.

The Plaintiffs make it clear that they wish to invoke international legal authority to the effect that \"the legal authority to determine nationality falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of a state.\" They propose to establish, with the assistance of Dr. Martinez, that they are a sovereign state, with the inevitable consequence that they must be in a position to decide who their members should be."], ["[84]", "Quite apart from the issue of whether any conclusions can be drawn from the Martinez reports that relate to the internal and integral traditions, practices, and customs of these particular Plaintiffs (and I do not think so), the effect of the Martinez evidence would be to turn this law suit, on the eve of the trial, into an adjudication about national sovereignty for North American aboriginal people generally and, by surmise and extrapolation, the Plaintiffs. Not only is this Court not the appropriate forum for such an adjudication, but the pleadings in this case do not raise such broad-ranging assertions or conclusions."], ["[85]", "As far as the pleadings to this case are concerned the \"right at stake\" to determine membership is, at most, based upon particular practices, traditions and customs of these Plaintiffs and does not require a general finding of political sovereignty, either for North American aboriginal peoples in general, or for these particular Plaintiffs."], ["[86]", "To allow the Martinez materials to be accepted as expert reports in these proceedings would shift, on the eve of the trial, the whole centre of gravity of the law suit in a direction that the Plaintiffs, at the time of the 1998 amendments to the pleadings, assured the Court and the Crown it did not need to go."], ["[87]", "At the hearing of this motion, Mr. Poretti did a valiant job in trying to salvage selected portions of the reports from vast tracts of material that have nothing to do with Canada, let alone the Plaintiffs in this case. But once the issue of general sovereignty is excluded, as I have decided it should be because \"That is not what this case is about,\" there is little in the reports that could even indirectly help the Court. In any event, the selective approach does not get around the fundamental problem, which is that the Martinez reports were not prepared to assist the Court with the particular issues in this law suit. They are advocacy materials prepared to promote and facilitate the general rights of indigenous peoples (including political sovereignty and nationhood) on the world stage. Counsel may wish to refer to this kind of generally available documentation in argument, but I do not feel it should be tendered and used as expert evidence on the issues before the Court in these proceedings."], ["[88]", "I can see that the reports are a valuable resource for the international debate concerning aboriginal self-government and nationhood and the rights of indigenous populations generally, but I do not think they assist the Court to decide the particular issues before it in this claim. The reports do not satisfy the test in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> for the admission of expert evidence, even with the gloss provided by Dickson J. (as he then was), in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Any minimal relevance they might have, even if not tainted by their obvious political objectives, would be far outweighed by the increase in costs and the extensions that would be required to deal with them at trial.", "ORDER"], ["[89]", "THIS COURT ORDERS THAT:", "1.

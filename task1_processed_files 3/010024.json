In August 2010, the Applicant was involved in an altercation with nationalists. The Applicant alleges that when the police intervened at the altercation, they detained him and took him to the police station because they recognized that he is Chechen; and, on his way to the police station, the police verbally and physically abused him; and, demanded that he pay a bribe or else he would be locked in a cell.", "On December 15, 2010, the Applicant left Russia and arrived in Toronto on the same day and made a refugee claim in, or about, July 2011."], ["[3]", "In a decision dated October 30, 2014, the RPD rejected the Applicant's claim for refugee status pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.

As well, the Applicant submits that the RPD made erroneous plausibility findings; and, did so without regard to the principle that plausibility findings shall only be made in the clearest cases (REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED).

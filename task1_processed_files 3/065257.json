In this case, the Adjudicator failed to consider the relevance of the timeline and sequence of events leading up to the dismissal. It is to be recalled that on October 16, 2008, in consequence of the first complaint and investigation, Payne received the most serious discipline short of dismissal (the Step Three warning). The Adjudicator found that Payne had not been given sufficient time to improve following this corrective action. However, this conclusion fails to take into account the conduct giving rise to that corrective action, and Payne's conduct both concurrent with and subsequent to, that corrective action."], ["[27]", "Payne received the Step Three warning for inappropriate conduct, which included demeaning and other inappropriate comments. Following the corrective action in which he was transferred to the Norwich branch, Payne returned to the Woodstock branch and had sexual relations with Carter on bank premises. These facts, which are not contested, vitiate the rationale that underlies the Adjudicator's finding that the dismissal was unjust. The Adjudicator's finding was predicated on his conclusion that the Bank ought to have allowed the corrective action time to take effect. It is clear from Payne's behaviour that the corrective action failed to have the desired effect, as he showed little or no understanding that his behaviour was unacceptable, and in fact continued to engage in inappropriate conduct in a similar vein to that which earned him the initial Step Three warning. As noted in", "Re Roberts and the Bank of Nova Scotia", "(1979), 1 LAC (3d) 259, this lack of self-awareness can render a continued employment relationship inappropriate:", "The complainant was guilty of misconduct worthy of discipline short of dismissal, but at the hearing she was completely unwilling to accept that she had been at fault in any way. In these circumstances, reinstatement is not, in my opinion, appropriate."], ["[28]", "The Adjudicator also appears to have given no weight to the fact that Payne was a manager and thus in a position of authority and trust. As a branch manager, Payne was expected to show leadership with respect to the Anti-Harassment policy and the Bank needed to be able to rely on his trustworthiness and good judgment. The Adjudicator's reasons evince a belief that he needed to find that Payne had either threatened Carter or held out some benefit in return for their sexual relationship in order to justify his dismissal. This is not the case."], ["[29]", "The role of a manager is to protect employees and the corporation. As noted in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  57 OR (3d) 351 at para 66:", "Furthermore, as a supervisor, the respondent had obligations to his employer.

If the supervisor creates the problem, he is in breach of that duty."], ["[30]", "Indeed, the Adjudicator did not consider the Anti-Harassment policy in a fulsome way. Harassment is defined in part in the policy as any conduct or language \"that creates a hostile, intimidating or offensive environment.\" Furthermore, as a manager, Payne was identified in the policy as a possible resource for employees who had experienced harassment, which should have been taken into account by the Adjudicator. As a manager, Payne had an obligation to adhere to the Bank's policies. The simple fact that the relationship between Payne and Carter was consensual does not change the fact that Payne's behaviour undermined the provisions of the Anti-Harassment policy. As noted by the court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above:", "[I]t is not only those in the workplace who are the direct victims of sexual harassment who may have a complaint about the conduct of a harassing supervisor. Others may be affected by receiving less favourable treatment, but also in other ways such as by enduring an unwelcome sexually charged atmosphere associated with the workplace, or risking the consequences of complaining about the situation."], ["[31]", "The Adjudicator's conclusion that the relationship was \"essentially a matter between two private people who happened to work in the same place\" does not accord with the evidence. By focusing only on the Anti-Harassment policy as it would apply between Payne and Carter, the Adjudicator failed to consider how other employees in the branch, particularly female employees, would perceive Payne's conduct and its implications for them.", "Absence of Harm"], ["[32]", "The second error of law of the Adjudicator was his belief that actual harm was required in order for Payne's dismissal to have been justified.

Actual harm is not required to justify a dismissal."], ["[33]", "As the Adjudicator noted, Payne exposed the Bank to a civil suit by Carter: \"Whether or not he breached any Policy, his conduct was at the very least, reckless in the extreme and put the Bank at real risk. Its reputation in the community could have been seriously damaged by publicity.\" The Adjudicator also found that at least one employee was aware of the relationship, which may have produced a negative work environment in which other employees assumed that the manager would favour one employee.

The Adjudicator's conclusion was animated by a belief that actual harm is necessary to justify dismissal:", "Despite the great risk faced by this employer,", "little or no actual harm came to it", ", unlike the situation in the above cases. The only proven work or community related consequence was that one other employee was aware of the situation.", "There was serious risk without real harm", "...", "In progressive discipline, the employee is moved up the ladder if lesser disciplines do not teach him/her anything.", "A very serious incident allows the employer to jump to discharge", ". Here the Bank saw the events as serious, as they were, but in my view went too far.", "As far as I can tell only the one employee learned of it", ".

He thereby reasoned that the risk of harm was not a sufficient basis, but that actual harm was required. It is in this regard that I find that the Adjudicator made an error of law. His incorrect belief that actual harm was necessary to justify dismissal of Payne formed the basis of his analysis and rendered his decision unreasonable."], ["[36]", "While the consequences of the conduct are a consideration, they are not determinative. The analysis, at its core, must focus on the judgment that underlies the conduct, and to situate it in the context of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test. To find otherwise would be to accord favourable treatment to an employee whose conduct, although demonstrating equally poor judgment, does not, through circumstance result in loss of injury to the company and its employees. The focus, particularly with employees in a management or supervisor capacity, must be on judgment, and not to the exclusion of consequence."], ["[37]", "In closing, I note as well inconsistency between the Adjudicator's characterization of Payne's conduct as \"reckless, foolish and dangerous\" and his responsibilities as supervisor and the Bank's lack of confidence in his judgement. The Adjudicator did not explain how conduct of this nature was consistent with the ongoing employment relationship.

[Emphasis in original]"], ["[42]", "Thus, the Adjudicator in", "Defence Construction", "found that he", "must", "order reinstatement unless convinced that the trust between the employer and employee could be restored. There are two errors in this finding-that an adjudicator is ever required to grant reinstatement (it is, rather, within their discretion), and that the only factor permitting an adjudicator to withhold reinstatement is the inability to restore trust (rather, many factors can be considered and weighed)."], ["[43]", "In contrast, the Adjudicator in this case did not find that he must order reinstatement unless he found the trust between the Bank and Payne could not be restored. Rather, he found that, while reinstatement is not a right, it is a preferred remedy, barring exceptional circumstances.

In my view, it is within his discretion as Adjudicator to prefer the remedy of reinstatement, so long as the relevant factors are considered."], ["[44]", "In this case, therefore, the Adjudicator's error lay not in his statement of the law, but in his avoidance of one of perhaps the most relevant factors; whether the trust and confidence between the Bank and Payne had been lost. The Adjudicator wrote the following on this point:", "Most of the bank cases which establish that they are different form normal ones in that trust is more significant, are cases of financial default by employees. Here that is not the situation. Thus trust not to steal is not in issue. Trust to tell the truth is, however. He denied the affair more than once. Perhaps that was understandable but ... I agree that bank employees may be held to a high standard."], ["[45]", "The Adjudicator was correct that trust to tell the truth was most definitely in issue. Yet, the Adjudicator never completed this thought or arrived at its necessary implication; that this breakdown in trust would make reinstatement an inappropriate remedy in this case. The Adjudicator's analysis on this point is lacking and does not meet the required standard of cogency. He found as fact that Payne lied more than once, and that Bank supervisors may be held to a high standard, but then excuses Payne from that principle. No explanation is given, simply the statement \"Perhaps that is understandable but ...\" That ellipsis does not explain why the failure to tell the truth and engaging in reckless, dangerous and foolish conduct did not affect the Bank's trust and confidence in him."], ["[46]", "Ultimately, the error in the Adjudicator's decision on remedy was the same as his error in the finding of unjust dismissal; he concluded that Payne deserved a second chance to learn from his previous discipline.

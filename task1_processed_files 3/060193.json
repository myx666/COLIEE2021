While Teva points out that ss. 8(2) and (4) both refer to s. 8(1), it is notable that the phrase \"in the absence of the Regulations\" does not itself appear in any of those subsections.

The Court of Appeal did not define the issue as \"what would have happened if the", "Regulations", "did not exist\".

While Teva rightly points out that the", "Regulations", "do not explicitly state that the liability period begins on the date that a first person commences a prohibition application, this, as Sanofi argues, is the necessary consequence of the fact that s. 8(1) makes a prohibition application a prerequisite for recovery. Subsection 8(1) expressly refers to the statutory stay by predicating a first person's liability upon the withdrawal, discontinuance, or dismissal of a prohibition application \"", "made under subsection 6(1)", "\" (emphasis added), or the reversal of a prohibition order.

Similarly, in assessing the constitutionality of s. 8, the Court of Appeal stated, at paragraph 66 of its decision, that \"an award of damages under section 8 logically flows from the section 6 prohibition proceedings\".

The 2006 RIAS also links a first person's liability to the operation of the stay by explaining that amendments to s. 8 \"further specify the matters the court may take into account when calculating the period of delay for which an innovator may be held liable\" and \"remove the word 'profits' from the provision prescribing the remedies available to a generic manufacturer seeking compensation", "for any loss arising from that delay", "\" (Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement, (2006) C Gaz II, 1503 at 1521 [2006 RIAS] [emphasis added])."], ["[56]", "While Teva points to", "Alendronate (FC)", "in support of the proposition that the service of an NOA is \"entirely irrelevant\" to the commencement date, its reliance on that case is misplaced.

Ms. Bowes testified that ANDS are not typically disclosed, with the exception of portions disclosed pursuant to orders made under the", "Regulations", "and product monographs that become public. Prior to the service of the notice of allegation, then, Sanofi had no notice of Teva's intentions.

The fact that Sanofi knew, from the date it received Teva's first notice of allegation, that Teva had approval in July 2003, is not enough.

First, Teva states that there is no evidence of any letter from the Minister of Health certifying that, in the absence of the", "Regulations", ", Apotex would have received its NOC in April of 2004. Absent such evidence, Teva argues, there is no basis to assume that the letter from Health Canada to Apotex dated April 29, 2004 advising Apotex of its April 26, 2004 patent hold date (Exhibit 142, Tab 7) was not superseded by a later letter. In my view, there is no need for Sanofi to \"prove\" that Apotex received a letter of certification. I am not attempting to establish a commencement date for Apotex's s. 8 damages claim. Rather, I am examining a hypothetical situation. A certification letter regarding Apo-ramipril would have been helpful and relevant, but it is not the only evidence that can assist me. As is widely understood, an NOC will issue following the approval of an ANDS. Moreover, Teva could have asked Apotex's chairman and chief executive officer, Dr. Sherman, or Ms. Bowes whether the letter of April 29, 2004 had been superseded. On the basis of the record before me, I accept the \"patent hold\" letter from Health Canada to Apotex dated April 29, 2004 as sufficient evidence to establish Apotex's approvability as of December 13, 2005."], ["[153]", "Teva's second assertion is that there is no evidence that the formulation actually sold by Apotex is the formulation that was approvable in April of 2004. Apotex's approved product monograph (dated December 12, 2006) bears two submissions numbers, #85886 and #91920. Teva points out that this means that there are two submissions which relate to that product monograph and that no evidence was led to explain this additional submission (#91920), including whether it relates to a different formulation. Thus, according to Teva, Sanofi has failed to establish that Apotex is even selling Apo-ramipril pursuant to the submission that was approved in April 2004 (#85886). This argument, in my view, unhelpfully mixes the real world with the hypothetical scenario that I am trying to build. I am satisfied that, in the \"but for\" world, Apotex would have been able to bring Apo-ramipril to market based on the April 2004 approval. The question as to which formulation was actually brought to market in late 2006 is simply irrelevant."], ["[154]", "For these reasons and based on the record before me, I conclude that Apotex would likely have had the necessary regulatory approvals to bring Apo-ramipril to market as of December 13, 2005.

That term is commonly used to refer to the situation in which a generic manufacturer succeeds in obtaining an NOC under the", "Regulations", ", but faces the possibility of being sued for patent infringement upon the launch of its product. Dr. Sherman admitted that Apotex assesses patent risk and takes steps to minimize its exposure in \"at risk\" situations, for example through seeking higher prices for product (e.g. perindopril), agreements with brand companies (e.g. atorvastatin) and development of non-infringing processes and formulations (e.g. esomeprazole).

When asked whether Apotex was the first Canadian company to develop a \"first-and-alone\" strategy, Dr. Sherman provided the following response:", "I think all generic companies essentially have the same strategy. We have certainly grown because we have been the best at it in many cases where we came to market well ahead of competitors who for various reasons didn't see certain opportunities, and the reverse has happened too."], ["[161]", "The very fact that Apotex was prepared to commence multiple attacks on the validity of any and all of Sanofi's patents on ramipril, while Teva stood by for years, speaks volumes to Apotex's willingness to assume risk.

In addition, I am not even certain that Apotex's hypothetical launch on December 13, 2005 would have been an at-risk launch.

Authorized generics obtain regulatory approval by submitting an administrative NDS instead of an ANDS. No bioequivalence study is required, as the authorized generic product is manufactured by the innovator. As a result, it is faster for authorized generics to obtain approval.

Teva's first argument is, therefore, inapplicable on the facts of this case, although it could be relevant in a future case. That is particularly so in light of Dr. Sherman's testimony regarding what he describes as the anti-competitive nature of AGs. In particular, Dr. Sherman testified that AGs are unfair for at least two reasons. First, AGs allow innovators to reduce a generic's potential profits (and s. 8 damages) and thus dissuade generics from investing in certain products. Second, an AG's low price is subsidized by the sales an innovator continues to make at a high price, as well as the tax subsidy innovators receive by recording the loss they suffer from selling an AG below cost against income earned from the higher priced sales of the innovator's own product. Dr. Sherman also testified that AGs are subsidized because they do not have to engage in litigation or research and development, and do not face any risk of liability for infringement from the innovator. In a future case where the evidence is different, such considerations might be relevant to an analysis under s. 8(5) of the", "Regulations", ".

The 2006 RIAS, above at 1525, contains the following remarks:", "As a final note, certain generic drug companies also argued very forcefully that the Government should incorporate measures in these amendments to address what they perceive as diminishing market incentives in their industry. More specifically, they contend that innovators are increasingly entering into licencing arrangements with willing generic companies (so-called \"authorized generics\") in order to pre-empt genuine generic competitors and retain market share past patent expiry. This practice, which is also said to be prevalent in the US, is currently being studied by the US Federal Trade Commission.

It is also telling that Sanofi did not require its AG to obtain a limited listing for its product."], ["[319]", "It is, therefore, more likely than not that Teva would have been able to make sales for the HOPE indications during the Relevant Period, without objection. It follows that any sales made during the Relevant Period which were solely related to the HOPE indications are still lost sales that Teva would have made in the absence of Sanofi's prohibition order, and losses for which Teva is entitled to recover under s. 8."], ["[320]", "Contrary to Sanofi's assertions, this does not lead to an \"absurd\" or \"unintended\" result by allowing a second person to circumvent the", "Regulations", ", which Sanofi says seek to preclude the infringement of listed patents. This is because, as Teva points out, generic products are not promoted for specific uses but rather sold as drug products, and the HOPE Patents are not at issue in this proceeding. If Sanofi believes that Teva is infringing or inducing infringement of the HOPE Patents, then Sanofi has a cause of action under the", "Patent Act", ". In that regard, I note that, since Teva and other generics began selling generic ramipril, Sanofi - who is no stranger to litigation - has not brought an action against any of the manufacturers for infringement of the HOPE Patents."], ["[321]", "Even if Sanofi is correct, and s. 8 prevents a second person from recovering for sales for an unapproved use, there is insufficient evidence to merit a reduction of Teva's damages on the facts of this case. Teva rightly points out that it would be impossible to determine how many patients were prescribed ramipril solely for the HOPE indications without access to confidential patient records. This contention is supported by the testimony of Dr. Lin and Dr. Brophy, who both stated that it would be very difficult to accurately distinguish between patients taking ramipril for HOPE indications, hypertension, ventricular dysfunction, or some combination without accessing their confidential records."], ["[322]", "I conclude, therefore, that Teva is not precluded from recovering losses associated with the HOPE indications. That is not to say that a second person may", "always", "recover for unapproved indications.

As noted at the beginning of these Reasons, right after the trial of this matter, I heard a companion case in Court File No. T-1357-09. There are obviously many similarities between the two cases. However, each case proceeded separately, with a different record.

The men wanted her to come with them to Italy. In March 2009, the claimant was forced into a car and raped by two men. As a result, the young girl quit school. She told her parents that the men were harassing her but did not give information about the rape. The parents made various police reports based on the information they had.

The evidence on this point is that of Dr. Pilowsky:", "As indicated, Dajana remains very inhibited particularly as she is quite mistrustful of others, given her past maltreatment, and feels especially vulnerable in the presence of adolescent or adult males. She appears to worry about others' perceptions of her, as she internalized, at some level, having a degree of responsibility for being a target for prostitution which fills her with profound humiliation, to the point she perceives herself as dishonoured and unworthy.", "(Application Record, pp. 77-78)"], ["[4]", "Since rape is a gender-based crime, and since Dajana is young and very vulnerable, I find that the RPD was required to take the greatest of care in evaluating her claim.

The United States Department of State Report for 2009, Exhibit RJA- I, item 2.1, reports discrimination against women and children was a problem. Further trafficking in persons remained problematic.

In addition, Counsel for the Applicants argues that once the RPD engaged the issue of whether state protection is available, it was required to provide a full, fair, and balanced analysis. In support of this argument, during the course of the hearing of the present Application, Counsel for the Applicant properly tendered documentary evidence from the same resource used by the RPD to demonstrate that a full, fair, and balanced analysis was not conducted (see:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[7]", "For balance, Counsel for the Applicants relies on the United States Department of State Report for Albania 2010, which contains the following relevant paragraph:", "The Government of Albania does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking", "; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government continued to improve its capacity to identify, protect, and reintegrate trafficking victims. It also successfully prosecuted some sex trafficking offenders leading to significant penalties imposed on them during the reporting period. In March 2009, the government approved an amendment to the Social Assistance law which will provide victims of trafficking with the same social benefits accorded to other at risk groups in Albania and provide government funding for shelters. The government continues to track and analyze trafficking trends through a nationwide database. Government officials have increased public attention to trafficking in Albania.", "There were serious concerns, however, about protection for victims who testified against their traffickers. The government did not vigorously prosecute labor trafficking offenders and did not adequately address trafficking-related complicity. Lack of political will and cooperation in some key government agencies hampered the government's overall ability to vigorously prosecute all forms of trafficking", ".

It is true that, during his testimony, the appellant expressed remorse by apologizing to Canadian authorities. However, in contrast, and somewhat contradictorily, the appellant stated on more than one occasion that he was not responsible for human smuggling and reiterated that he had been an innocent victim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"[20] At the hearing, he described the conspiracy theory involving the Costa Ricans. He explained that, in exchange for a reduced prison sentence, the Americans had persuaded the Costa Ricans to tell the authorities that the appellant had smuggled them across the border for a payment of $2,000 each ... He claims that he did not have $12,000 on him when he was arrested by U.S. authorities, proof, according to him, that this was a lie. However, at no point during his interview with the CBSA or at the hearing, did the appellant mentioned having paid anything to the person who allegedly helped him across the border. The panel cannot help but notice the appellant's denial of responsibility in his desperate attempt to find another guilty party. Furthermore, despite having had a year to think about his actions while serving his sentence in the United States, the appellant apparently found the means to get in trouble with the law as soon as he returned to Canada. It has to be said that it was not easy to get the appellant to testify on this matter. Firstly, when asked whether he had had other problems with the law in Canada following his run-in with the U.S. authorities, he answered no and repeated this answer on four occasions. It was only when shown Exhibit R-2, an offence under subparagraph 334(b)(ii) of the", "Criminal Code", ", that the appellant first said that he could not remember and then that he [Translation] 'could not remember exactly'. He eventually remembered having appeared in court once or twice with a friend who had allegedly stolen something from a Canadian Tire store. When asked whether he was sure that this had merely involved a case of shoplifting, he said yes and explained that he had been accused of stealing some gloves. Eventually, the appellant changed his testimony and talked about a stolen car. Obviously, the appellant has not been convicted of the crimes that appear in his criminal record regarding offences allegedly committed on July 13, 2004. However, the panel continues to observe the same reluctance in his manner of testifying, and, here too, the appellant blames the friend he was apparently accompanying. The least one can conclude from the appellant's criminal record and the manner of his testimony is that it seems very unlikely, given the little remorse he shows and the type of people he associates with, that the appellant has strong potential for rehabilitation. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[44]", "The Board further considered the length of time Mr. Gonzalez has spent in Canada and the degree to which he is established. On this point, contrary to what Mr. Gonzalez alleged, he has been in Canada since 2000. Therefore, he was not 17 years old when he came to Canada. The Board further noted that, between 2000 and the time of the hearing before the Board, Mr. Gonzalez had been imprisoned in the United States for a year. Accordingly, the applicant has only been in Canada for five years at the most. The Board thus properly concluded that Mr. Gonzalez had spent most of his life in Guatemala. Additionally, Mr. Gonzalez's statement that he no longer has any ties to his country of origin was not based on the evidence and was not confirmed by his affidavit, which simply stated that he had a large network of friends in Montréal and that his immediate family is there, including brothers and sisters on his mother's side.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[45]", "Further, the Board took into account Mr. Gonzalez's family situation and the support available to him within his family and the community. It noted Mr. Gonzalez's relationship to his mother and the fact that he lived with his pregnant wife. On these two points, the Board expressed in its reasons a certain reservation as to the nature of these relationships, based on the oral evidence:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"[22] ... Moreover, although he claims that he is on good terms with and is close to his mother, the panel cannot help but be concerned about her absence from the hearing. The appellant simply explained that he preferred having his wife testify, as she is closer to him than his mother is. Given the absence of the appellant's mother, the panel finds it hard to believe that the appellant is as close to his mother as he claims to be. The appellant explained that his mother, who is separated from his father, remarried a man called Galdamez, whom he does not like very much. Strangely, the appellant married this man's daughter on October 22, 2005 ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"[23] ... Ms. Galdamez stated that she had met the appellant in 2000. According to the appellant's testimony, the young couple went out for two years, that is, right until he was sentenced to one year's imprisonment in the United States. The couple supposedly maintained their relationship during his imprisonment. The appellant stated that he wrote or telephoned Ms. Galdamez over a three-month period. In fact, during the seven months that followed, his wife apparently returned to her family in El Salvador. The appellant does not remember his wife's birthday; according to him, she is 19 years old. In fact, Ms. Galdamez was born on March 22, 1987 and was therefore 18 years old on the day of the hearing. With regard to the development of their relationship, her testimony contradicts that of the appellant. According to her, they met in 2000, but only went out together for about six months. She states that she visited the appellant only once in prison, albeit not as his girlfriend but simply to accompany the appellant's sister. Ms. Galdamez explained that she even went out with another young man during the entire time her husband was in prison. She claims that communications between her and her husband are good and that the couple has no secrets. Yet, she claims that her husband has never had any problems with the law following his troubles with U.S. law and has neither been arrested nor appeared in court. Apart from unpaid speeding tickets, she is completely unaware of her husband's alleged troubles with the law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"[24] Ms. Galdamez states that, if the appeal is dismissed, she will leave Canada with her husband. The panel is not particularly satisfied as to the seriousness of their relationship. The civil wedding, which was described by the appellant and his wife as a trial marriage and which was celebrated in a very contemporary manner on October 20, 2005, while the appellant was subject to a removal order, leaves the panel quite perplexed. The contradictory testimonies as to the evolution of the couple's relationship also throw doubt on the genuineness of the relationship. As for the alleged pregnancy, it is a mere possibility. Furthermore, given the general lack of credibility of the witnesses, the panel cannot give serious consideration to this possibility. In any case, if the relationship is truly serious, Ms. Galdamez has expressed the wish to leave Canada with her husband. Moreover, the panel questions the influence this young 18-year-old woman has on decisions made by the appellant, the people he associates with and his actions. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[46]", "The Board also considered the dislocation to both Mr. Gonzalez and his family that his deportation to his country of origin would cause.

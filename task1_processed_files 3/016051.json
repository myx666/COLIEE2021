In regards to the validity of the marriage, the officer noted that the Applicant was officially divorced from his first wife on September 16, 2001, less than a month before marrying his current wife.

The issue affects the individual Applicant's procedural rights and the IAD has no greater expertise in applying the doctrine relative to the Court's expertise in this area of the law.

He argues that the new facts which arose since the first IAD decision rendered on August 9, 2004 preclude a finding that the same question had been decided in the earlier proceedings. The Applicant relies on the alleged new facts that between the August 9, 2004 decision (first IAD decision) and the February 27, 2006 dismissal of the Applicant's appeal (second IAD decision) his wife became pregnant, he had ongoing contact with his wife and he provided her with continuing financial support.

Applicants have the onus of establishing these requirements on a balance of probabilities ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.), at para. 11,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , para. 22). This set of statutory criteria forms the basis of the questions in sponsorship appeals before the IAD.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "The IAD is a court of competent jurisdiction with the authority to dispose of sponsorship appeals (", "IRPA", ", s. 62). It has all the powers vested in a superior court of record with respect to any matter necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction (", "IRPA", ", s. 174(1) and (2)). Following the first IAD proceeding, where the Applicant provided documentary evidence and was granted an oral hearing, the IAD answered the question of whether the Applicant's relationship with Ms. Akter was a bona fide and valid marriage and whether it was entered into primarily to acquire a privilege under the", "IRPA", ". On a balance of probabilities, the IAD found that the Applicant's marriage was neither genuine, nor valid and was most likely entered into primarily to help Ms. Akter immigrate to Canada. In essence, this is an answer to the same questions raised by the Applicant's second appeal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "The second appeal met all the res judicata criteria: it raised the same question, the prior decision was final, and the parties were identical.

First, the Applicant argues that although the new facts already mentioned above (his wife's pregnancy, telephone calls to his wife, and ongoing financial support of his wife) constituted fresh evidence of a genuine marriage, the IAD failed to consider them.

I note that I was unable to find money transfer slips or any evidence that the Applicant was sending money to Bangladesh.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "Thus far in these proceedings, the Applicant has been unable to persuade the respective decision makers that his marriage was genuine or legally valid. The IAD, in its first decision dated August 9, 2004, outlined the main reasons for its conclusions at paragraph 3:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"The marriage is not valid legally as both spouses did not wait before the 90 day period had expired following the pronouncement of the appellant's divorce from his first wife; the divorce affidavit is not acceptable as a legal document; no wedding pictures were provided; no wedding ceremony; events (divorce, engagement, marriage, departure of the appellant) happened in a very short period of time and lack of knowledge of the appellant's life in Canada. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "At paragraph 17 the IAD, in the same decision, expressed the following concerns:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"The panel notes that not only the appellant and the applicant have not seen each other [sic] since October 5, 2001, but no evidence of money transfers, nor of meaningful contact between spouses, such as telephone bills, letters, or greeting cards, was produced at the hearing. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "Although the Applicant now alleges that the IAD failed, in the decision currently under review, to consider the telephone bills or the medical note regarding the Applicant's wife's pregnancy, this allegation is not correct. The IAD considered both, but it found neither sufficient to offset the factors weighing against the Applicant. At paragraph 12, the IAD wrote:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"More than telephone calls or alleged pregnancy are required [sic], in my view, to establish a genuine spousal relationship not entered [into] for immigration purposes and to constitute decisive fresh evidence of a genuine marital relationship. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "The telephone bills indicate fairly regular phone calls to Bangladesh, but on their own they do not establish a genuine marriage: different Bangladeshi phone numbers appear, but no explanation was provided in the written submissions. The doctor's note attesting to Ms. Akter's pregnancy is also undermined by a lack of corroborating evidence. Specifically, the Applicant submitted no evidence of any trips to Bangladesh made by the Applicant after the wedding in September 2001. Presumably the Applicant was aware that the lack of evidence showing travel to Bangladesh concerned the IAD as the IAD said so in paragraph 17 of its earlier decision. Further, the mere existence of a child does not, on its own, establish the genuineness of a relationship (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 12). Without any corroborating evidence showing that the child was the Applicant's or that it was even born, it was open to the IAD to find that the alleged pregnancy did not establish a genuine relationship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "The IAD's second decision does not refer to the new legal opinion from a Bangladeshi lawyer attesting to the validity of the Applicant's marriage. While it would have been better for the IAD to have turned its mind to these submissions in its reasons, a tribunal need not mention every piece of evidence in its reasons and is assumed to have weighed and considered all evidence before it, unless the contrary is shown (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 299 F.T.R. 262 (F.C.), at para. 22). In any event, it is a moot point in this case because the lawyer's opinion could have reasonably been produced at the first appeal. Therefore, the opinion fails to meet the threshold of decisive \"fresh\" evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "The Applicant relies on", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to support his argument that the phone bills and the medical note establish evidence of an on-going genuine relationship. In my view,", "Dhaliwal", "does not help the Applicant. First,", "Dhaliwal", "was \"an abuse of process\" case, rather than one of res judicata. Abuse of process requires the moving party to meet a stricter test: an additional serious element is required and it must only be invoked in the \"clearest of cases\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 161; 231 W.A.C. 161). Second, Justice Campbell in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 9, expressed his opinion that the IAD in that case had \"ample, new, and relevant evidence which should have been considered\".

First, he says that the IAD's decision is not in the best interests of his child. For the reasons outlined above, I am of the opinion that the Applicant has not met his evidentiary burden of satisfying the IAD that the alleged child was his or even that Ms. Akter gave birth to a child. Second, the Applicant alleges that his representation at the first IAD hearing was incompetent. The Applicant has failed to supply any evidence to support this allegation. The only evidence on record is that the Applicant was represented by counsel at the first appeal. Without more, I am unable to find that he has suffered an injustice because of his counsel during his first hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(4) Should the Immigration Appeal Division have granted the Applicant an oral hearing?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[33]", "The Applicant also raises the procedural fairness argument that he should have received an oral hearing on his second appeal.

First, while it is true that the application of res judicata in effect denied the Applicant an oral hearing on the merits, preventing litigants from re-litigating questions that have already been settled by a court of competent jurisdiction is what the doctrine is designed to achieve. By definition res judicata is a pre-hearing matter that, if applied, precludes a full hearing. (This potentially harsh result helps to explain why safeguards were built into the second stage of the legal test for applying the doctrine).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at paragraphs 9-10, the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed that the IAD has the authority to summarily dismiss, i.e. without a full hearing on the merits, an appeal when the appellant seeks to re-litigate on essentially the same evidence. These are the circumstances that arose in this case. Therefore, the IAD was not required to grant the Applicant an oral hearing and was entitled to decide the appeal on the evidence as filed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[35]", "Second, the IAD specifically notified the Applicant that his appeal may be decided on the basis of written submissions and asked him to proceed accordingly. In a letter dated October 14, 2005 the IAD invited the Applicant to make submissions on the issue of res judicata and informed the Applicant that, if the doctrine applied, his appeal may be subject to dismissal without an oral hearing. The IAD added that it normally decides res judicata motions without an oral hearing. In a bolded portion of the letter, the IAD again warned the Applicant about the real possibility of there being no further hearing:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Please proceed on the basis that there will be no oral hearing in this motion. Accordingly, you should send to the Immigration Appeal Division and to the Minister's counsel written argument on whether or not the appeal should be dismissed by reason of the application of res judicata. ... In addition to written argument, the appellant may provide affidavit evidence from the appellant and any other supporting witnesses setting out the new evidence that is being tendered in the support of the appeal. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[36]", "Third, the fresh evidence submitted by the applicant was so weak that it did not trigger any concerns.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "IV.", "Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[37]", "In summary, none of the circumstances raised by the Applicant in his second appeal would necessarily compel the IAD to exercise its discretion not to apply issue estoppel in this case. The IAD did not find the Applicant's new evidence capable of altering the findings of the first proceeding. Moreover, it found that applying res judicata did not condone an improper process or work an injustice on the Applicant.

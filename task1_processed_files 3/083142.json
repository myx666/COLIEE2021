He says the bulldozers were part of an effort to demolish the neighbourhood and to displace the Kurdish residents. The Applicant says he was arrested and detained for five days for his participation. He was beaten and required medical treatment on his release.

The RPD said that the Board's documentary evidence led it to conclude that while the system exists, \"its ability to track and report an individual's location is limited\" (CTR at 58).

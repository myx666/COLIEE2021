However,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court also recognizes that there is discretion to hear moot cases and the Court should consider several issues, including whether there remains a live controversy.

Both applicants have clearly applied for and obtained their leave periods for their visit to Canada. They are gainfully employed and their employment awaits them upon return to Nigeria."], ["[39]", "Although the parties argue over whether the applicants would be better off in Canada, considering the amount of income of the applicants in Nigeria, the applicants’ arguments are more compelling. First, the officer did not consider the comparative standard of living. Clearly they enjoy a very comfortable living by all standards in Nigeria. They own a prime real estate landed property, they pay to put their children through International School, they own a BMW, a luxurious vehicle in Nigeria, and apart from a local currency Bank account the principal applicant owns a US Bank account in a third world country. Second, the officer did not consider the impact that an illegal status would have on the ability of the applicants to earn income in Canada. The applicants statement that it is better to wait the outcome of their permanent residence application is persuasive."], ["[40]", "The applicants have also provided an itinerary, including details as to their return trip home. The principal applicant’s brother and common-law wife have comfortable steady income (brother shows a Canadian Income Tax Notice of Assessment of $104,000 and his spouse of $46,057) and have expressed a willingness to host the family members while in Canada. The applicant included the original copy of the wedding invitation to substantiate the reason for their visit."], ["[41]", "More significantly, it was patently unreasonable for the officer to conclude that the applicants were leaving their two other children behind to be cared for by their relatives on a permanent basis without putting this theory to the applicants. It is not reasonable to assume that parents would not return to care for their two young children and to assume the children would be able to stay with their aunt or uncle. This is discussed further below with respect to the right of the applicants to respond to the officer’s concerns."], ["[42]", "If there was nothing wrong with considering previous travel history as a factor that does not assist the applicants, on the other hand, it also does not hurt their application, since they have no negative travel history.

First, contrary to the assertion of the respondent, the applicants were completely forthcoming with respect to the existence of their other applications for permanent residence. They identified both applications for permanent residence on their application for temporary residence form. The applicants even included an explanatory letter providing further information as to these applications."], ["[46]", "Legally, an officer is obligated to consider each application on its own merits. The officer was not entitled to use the fact that the applicants have an outstanding application for permanent residence to deny them their temporary resident visas and this is evident from the plain language of the legislation. Subsection 22(2) of IRPA explicitly precludes denying an application for temporary status on the basis that there is an outstanding permanent resident application if the decision maker believes the person will return. Thus, the legislation appears to demand that a decision-maker determine on the basis of objective evidence whether the person will return, irrespective of any outstanding permanent resident applications. Most of the objective evidence here was disregarded for no valid reason."], ["[47]", "The jurisprudence also supports the applicants’ position, although there is some conflicting case law. In the case raised by the respondent, de la Cruz, a visa officer refused to issue a visitor’s visa partially because the applicant had a permanent resident application pending. Justice Jerome concluded that:", "Pursuant to ss. 2(1) and 8 of the Act, the onus is on the visitor to show that his entry to Canada would not be contrary to the Act or Regulations. This is reinforced by the fact that he will be presumed to be an immigrant seeking permanent resident status, and this intent must be countered by evidence of a temporary purpose. In such a situation, the intent of the applicant is properly subject to examination by visa officers and factors which may show non-temporary purpose will be taken into consideration. Viewed in this context, it was not improper for the visa officer to refuse the visitor visas on the basis of an outstanding application for permanent residence in Canada."], ["[48]", "However, more recent jurisprudence decided under the current legislation supports the applicants’ position.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court reviewed a decision to refuse an applicant a student visa on the grounds the visa officer did not believe that the student would return to her home country. In making that decision, the visa officer relied on the fact that the applicant and her family had an outstanding application for permanent residence. The Court concluded that where an application for permanent residence is not before the decision-maker, it cannot be relied on in the temporary resident application."], ["[49]", "In addition, the OP-11 manual that guides officers in decisions on temporary resident applications discusses the principle of dual intent at paragraph 5.4 and concludes that “the person’s desire to work, study or visit in Canada before or during the processing of an application for permanent residence may be legitimate”. Thus, an intention by a foreign national to become a permanent resident does not preclude an individual from becoming a temporary resident unless the officer is satisfied that the foreign national will not leave Canada by the end of the period authorized by his or her stay. But in order to satisfy himself the officer must look objectively at the request and all the supporting information; he should not, as he obviously did here, decide subjectively, and ignore what favors the applicants."], ["[50]", "For all of these reasons, the officer’s decision on the evidence available appears to be patently unreasonable.", "The Right of the Applicants to Respond to the Officer’s Concerns"], ["[51]", "There is no statutory right to an interview: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 28. However, procedural fairness requires that an applicant at least be given an opportunity to respond to an officer’s concerns under certain circumstances. In Ali the Court also held at paragraph 20 that a visa officer should inform the applicant of his concerns, despite the lack of a statutory right, when the visa officer has obtained extrinsic evidence. The Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  relied on Ali when it concluded at paragraph 16 that “since the visa officer did not consider extrinsic information and there is no general obligation on a visa officer to put his or her concerns to an applicant, the applicant was not entitled to an interview or an opportunity to respond”."], ["[52]", "When no extrinsic evidence is relied on, it is unclear when it is necessary to afford an applicant an interview or a right to respond. However, the jurisprudence suggests that there will be right to respond under certain circumstances. In the context of a Foreign Skilled Worker Class assessment in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court reviews the case law and highlights the uncertainty in the jurisprudence. In some cases, the officer was not required to put before the applicant any tentative conclusions he might be drawing from the material. Other cases have concluded that sometimes an applicant must have an opportunity to respond to concerns even where it arises out of the evidence tendered by the applicant. However,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court concludes that there is no obligation on the part of a visa officer to apprise an applicant of his or her concerns that arise directly from the requirements of the former Act or Regulations."], ["[53]", "Although it is difficult in the present instance to fit the findings of the officer into these categories, since his concerns arose from his belief that the applicants would not return to Canada on the evidence provided, as required by the Act. However, other cases have interpreted the right to respond more broadly. In Yuan at paragraph 12, the Court recognizes that there is a requirement that the visa officer provides the applicant with an opportunity to address a major concern. Similarly, in Wang, the Court concluded at paragraph 13 that:", "“Although the case law instructs that the duty of fairness owed by a Visa Officer to a student-visa Applicant is limited, it is my view that the particular circumstances of this case are such that the Visa Officer ought to have advised the Applicant about her concerns about the sincerity of his cousin's offer of support, and his bona fides as a temporary visitor to Canada, and provided an opportunity to respond. I arrive at this conclusion because the evidence produced by the Applicant cannot be said to be weak. Moreover, there is nothing contained in his application which suggests that he intends to stay in Canada permanently.

In my view, the officer in this situation should have allowed the applicant an opportunity to respond to his concerns. The applicant had no way of knowing that the visa officer would act upon his view that those in their \"formative years\" may not study in Canada for a four year period, since they would be unlikely to leave the country. The visa officer's failure to give the applicant an opportunity to respond to his concerns, on the facts of this case, amounted to a breach of the rules of natural justice.”"], ["[56]", "In the present case, the applicants had no way of knowing that the officer would rely on several factors, including the fact that he believed they would leave their children behind permanently because the children have an aunt and uncle in Nigeria."], ["[57]", "The OP-11 manual at part 14 also sets out a different test. “A person should never be requested to attend an interview if it is evident through a review of the paper application that the applicant is ineligible and additional information would not alter a refusal decision.” Here, additional information might have altered the refusal decision, particularly with respect to the care of the Applicants’ children left behind during their stay in Canada.", "Adequacy of Reasons"], ["[58]", "The standard for sufficiency of reasons was outlined in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> relying on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)(QL).

Although the notes state the basis for the decision, they do not provide in sufficient detail an analysis of why the officer held that the applicants would not return to Nigeria at the end of their authorized stay.

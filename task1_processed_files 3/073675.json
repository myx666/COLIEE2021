They claimed Convention refugee status. The Applicants moved to the Hamilton, Ontario area.

No prejudice would have flowed from the long delay if it had then been promptly forwarded to the Immigration Centre. Unfortunately it was not.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The substance of the report, prepared by Dr. Bronte Golda and entitled \"Medical Legal Report\" reads as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"I am writing this medical report at your request in regards to this nine-year old boy. You are wishing for me to provide you with some explanation of the report that you received from Dr. Peer who is a Pediatrician, who, at my request, saw this boy. On interviewing the mother and going through various reports from Poland, I am in the position to give you a background history on this boy. Between 1987 and 1988 this boy was admitted to a hospital twice, when he was treated with steroids intravenously, inhalation and the treatment lasted about a week. Also, the Polish system is slightly different than the Canadian system, when the patient gets sick at home and the family calls the ambulance, the doctor always attend the ambulance driver and provides the immediate necessary treatment at home. This means that each visit to the patient's house may not end up with taking that particular patient to the hospital. According to the mother, this boy was treated by an ambulance physician almost once per week with an attack of asthma, and the treatment was consistent with inhalation and intravenous hydrocortisone at home. Since they arrived in Hamilton, this boy only uses a Ventolin puffer maybe once a year when he gets a cold. He does not require any IV steroids which, of course, will have severe adverse side effects since he is so young, and also will create the asthma to be dependent on steroids which would end up causing him to have tremendous side effects in the long-run. In regards to the area where they live, they are coming from the east part of Poland, which was severely exposed to Chernobyl radiation and this could have had some effect on this child.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"In summary then, I think it not very human to tell this boy, after he spent some years in Canada, to go back to Poland. Where I would say there is quite a high chance of a return of his asthmatic attacks, due to severe pollution, where the care is not readily available with the newest methods of treating asthma. Also, this boy had done very well at school. His English is great. Since everything is coming along very good for these people, I would not see any reason why Canada has to send them back. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The report of Dr. Peer, a pediatrician, that is referred to in the foregoing report and was addressed to Dr. Golda, is dated the 12th day of June, 1991 and in substance reads as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"I saw Rafal on the 10th of June, 1991. He is nine and has a history of asthma. I understand that you reviewed the reports from Poland and between 1987 and 1989 he was admitted a few times to hospital and was in severe asthmatic attack. He required IV steroids at that time. I do not know whether there are environmental factors responsible for it or other reasons but it seems that since he came to Canada about 1½ years ago he has been stable without any attacks. Initially he was in Newfoundland and was treated with Ventolin but didn't really require much of it. Since then he has improved gradually and he apparently did not require any medications at the present time.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"He has no asthma on exertion and apparently does not have any known allergies to cause any problems since he came to Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"The past medical history revealed that he was born in Poland, birthweight was 2.5 kg, he was small for gestational age. Currently he is in Grade 3 in Canada and is doing well at school.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"The family history revealed that the sister aged 11½ is healthy, the parents are healthy, no history of any asthma or allergies in the family.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"On examination, Rafal is a nine year old boy, weight is 28 kg, the height is 131 cm., both around the 50th percentile line, indicating very good growth. The blood pressure is 100/70 and the heart rate is about 80 per minute. The head was normal, eyes are normal, he has no ENT infections. The lungs are clear to auscultation, the air entry was excellent, there were no rales, rhonchi or bronchospasms. He has no murmurs, the abdomen is normal, the neurological examination is unremarkable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Rafal seems to do well at this point. He does not appear to require any medications for his asthma and it is possible that his asthma was precipitated by certain allergens which are not present around this area. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "On the 15th day of October, 1991, without either of the foregoing reports having been brought to his attention, through no failing on the part of the Respondent or his or her officials I should point out, the second humanitarian and compassionate review resulted in a decision against the Applicants in the following terms:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"This letter refers to the request you have made on behalf of the above mentioned individuals for a review of their personal circumstances in consideration of the decision for their removal from Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"First, I would like to apologize for the undue delay in responding to your submission.

Officer Bauly refused to entertain at that meeting oral representations on behalf of the Applicant's with regard to humanitarian and compassionate considerations but did agree to consider written representations, thus opening for a third time the issue of consideration of an application for landing from within Canada. Apparently the date of April 22nd remained firm.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "Officer Bauly heard nothing by the 16th day of April. On that date she telephoned one of the solicitors for the Applicants. In a telephone conversation, she reconfirmed her willingness to receive written submissions, but indicated later the same day that a conference call would not be necessary for the purposes of the review. A copy of Dr. Golda's report (and apparently not a copy of Dr. Peer's report) was transmitted the same day by fax to Officer Bauly. The report was passed on to the attending Canada Immigration physician for his review. His advice was to the effect that Dr. Golda's report failed to establish sufficient medical reasons to allow the Applicants to apply for landed status from within Canada. No meeting took place and no teleconference was held involving the Canada Immigration official and physician and Dr. Golda and the Applicants solicitors.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "Officer Bauly telephoned the Applicants solicitors and informed them of the conclusion of the Canada Immigration physician.

The Duty To Act Fairly  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "Counsel for the Applicants conceded before me that, given the factual background in this matter, Officer Bauly's decision, if she had simply and categorically refused any further review of compassionate and humanitarian considerations, would most likely have been unassailable. But, she argued, having undertaken a further review, having demonstrated compassion if you will, she then had to respect the duty to act fairly, at least to the minimum standard of that duty which, it was argued, required Officer Bauly to advise the Applicants of the case against them and provide them an opportunity to reply to that case. This minimum standard of fairness could have been met, it was argued, if Officer Bauly or her superiors had acceded to the request of the Applicant's solicitors for a telephone conference call that would have involved, presumably, Officer Bauly, the decision maker, and her medical advisor and the Applicants' solicitors and their medical advisor, Dr. Golda. The Applicants' solicitors and Dr. Golda held themselves ready for such a call throughout the critical day of the 16th of April, 1993.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "I conclude that the Applicants' case must fail on this ground.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  stated as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Next, the doctor's report is honest and probably frightening.

All of the data were before the officers and I could find nothing they ignored. There were positive aspects of the applicant's case such as her work record with L'Hotel and her knowledge of the English language. Similarly, there was for consideration by the officers the doctor's report and the impact of a negative decision, namely return to the Philippines to poverty or near poverty conditions. In the final analysis all this was before the officers and considered.

The Applicants were aware of young Rafal's medical condition and its relevance to a humanitarian and compassionate review as is evidenced by their solicitor's letter dated the 1st day of April, 1991. At the urging of Officer Bauly, they submitted a copy of Dr. Golda's report by fax on the 16th day of April, 1992. It was considered. It was not ignored.

They knew that it was important to present for Officer Bauly's consideration the whole of their case. They appear not to have done so. To suggest, in such circumstances that the Respondent failed to respect the duty to act fairly by failing to disclose the case that the Applicants had to meet was essentially to suggest that the Respondent had a duty to prescribe to the Applicants what it would take to make out their case. I find there is no such duty on the Respondent. The Respondent agreed to reopen the issue of humanitarian and compassionate considerations when there was no obligation to do so. An oral hearing was rejected when no notice had been given of the desire to make oral representations, but it was indicated that written representations would be considered. When these submissions were not forthcoming within a reasonable time, the Respondent reached out to the Applicants to remind them. All submissions provided were considered. Professional advice was solicited and considered. The decision was communicated to the Applicants solicitors and the opportunity to once again bolster the Applicants case was rejected.

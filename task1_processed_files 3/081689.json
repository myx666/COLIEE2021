The applicant is a citizen of the Republic of Georgia, who fled that country due to an alleged fear of violence at the hands of a member of the police force in Georgia with whom she claims she had an extramarital affair."], ["[4]", "The applicant first went to the United States of America in 1999, allegedly to have a break from this individual, and travelled under her own passport. At this point she says she had not yet decided to leave Georgia permanently and, indeed, voluntarily returned to Georgia in 2000. She says her husband was killed in an automobile accident in 2000 and that the individuals responsible for the accident approached her lover, to try and have him pressure her to stop making inquiries about the accident. When she refused to do so, she says that her lover threatened and beat her, causing her to seek to flee Georgia to return to the U.S. She claims that she was too frightened to seek a U.S. visa in Georgia as she feared her lover was having her watched and instead went to Moscow, where she purchased a false Russian passport, issued under the name of Irina Khachirova. She obtained the requisite U.S. visa under the false passport and returned to the U.S. in September of 2001, using the Khachirova passport. In early 2002, the applicant's own passport was returned to her by a friend, and, consequently, the applicant was then in possession of two passports."], ["[5]", "After she had received her own passport, the applicant was charged with shoplifting in May 2002. She provided her name as Irina Khachirova and a conviction was entered against her under this name. It is unclear whether she provided the authorities with the Khachirova passport in respect of these charges. The applicant received a small fine for this shoplifting offence."], ["[6]", "Later that year, in September 2002, the applicant made an asylum claim with the U.S. authorities under her own name and presumably provided them with her own passport. In 2005 she was again convicted of and fined for shoplifting, this time in her own name. In 2009, the applicant was deported from the U.S. to Georgia, and in 2010 she came to Canada and made a refugee claim here."], ["[7]", "The applicant provided incomplete and inaccurate information about her American convictions in her Personal Identification Form [PIF] that she filed in support of her Canadian asylum claim. In the original PIF, she referred only to having faced charges for (but not being convicted of) shoplifting in 2002, and in her amended PIF referred only to the second conviction, which she represented as being her first \"defence\" (by which she presumably meant her first offence). Through questioning, the Member discovered that the applicant had, in fact, received two convictions for shoplifting in the U.S. and also learned that she had used a false name for part of the time she was in the U.S. The hearing was therefore adjourned to provide notice to the Minister, to allow the respondent to make representations on the question of exclusion and to obtain additional information about the applicant's U.S. immigration history and convictions.", "II.", "The RPD's Decision"], ["[8]", "Following two additional days of hearing, the RPD issued the decision that is the subject of the present application for judicial review.

It focussed in this regard not on the shoplifting but rather on the applicant's use of the forged passport and of the fraudulent Khachirova identity when she was arrested and convicted of shoplifting and held that such actions would correspond to the offences set out in paragraph 57(b)(i) and subsection 403(1) and (2) of the", "Criminal Code of Canada", ", RSC 1985, c C-46, [", "Criminal Code", "] - namely forgery of or uttering a forged passport and identity fraud.

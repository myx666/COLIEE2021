She was not a member of the family class because of the operation of paragraph 117(9)(d). At the time her sponsor applied for permanent residence, she was a \"non-accompanying family member\" and \"was not examined.\" Although not addressed specifically in the letter, the decision applied equally to the two daughters.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "Mr. Azizi appealed to the IAD under subsection 63(1) of", "IRPA", ".

He stated that he was unable to pursue post-secondary education there and had no way to leave Pakistan other than through the WUSC sponsorship and scholarship program. The criteria for the WUSC program required him to be single, so he did not disclose his wife and children.

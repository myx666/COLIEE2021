The applicant submits that his AEO identified the specific language requirements for the position as the ability to speak and write in Chinese and the ability to speak English at a basic level. No other language requirements are set out in section 82 of the Regulations. However, rather than assessing the applicant's language proficiency according to the AEO requirements, the officer assessed the applicant's language abilities on an elevated standard. The applicant submits that in doing so, the officer erred in law as she did not have the jurisdiction to require language proficiency above those required by Service Canada in the AEO."], ["[22]", "Moreover, the applicant submits that even if the officer had such jurisdiction, she did not advise him of what level of language he would have to demonstrate to prove that he could accomplish the tasks as a cook. In so doing, the officer committed a procedural fairness violation."], ["[23]", "Second, the applicant submits that the officer ignored material evidence adduced by the applicant on a central issue of the case. This too was an error of law. Upon receipt of the applicant's permanent residence application, the officer requested that the applicant submit \"any information or documents\" relevant to his language abilities within 60 days. The applicant submits that the officer did not specify that an English language test was required, nor what evidence of language abilities she was looking for. The applicant also notes that a language test is not required to prove language ability under the arranged employment factor."], ["[24]", "In response to the officer's request, the applicant submitted: a video of him speaking in English and of a tutor providing further detail on the applicant's English abilities; a handwritten letter that he drafted in English; and a transcript from the Guangdong University of Business Studies indicating that he received a mark of 85 in an English course. This evidence proves that the applicant can speak, read, write and understand English. The applicant submits that the officer erred by ignoring this compelling evidence without providing a proper explanation on why the evidence was deficient."], ["[25]", "Third, the applicant submits that the officer erred by double penalizing him for an alleged lack of English abilities. The applicant highlights the officer's awarding of zero points under both the official language proficiency factor and the arranged employment factor based on the applicant's alleged lack of English proficiency. This was a case of double-counting which also constitutes an error of law. Although this argument relies on jurisprudence that developed on the previous", "Immigration Regulations", ", 1978, the applicant submits that this principle still applies today."], ["[26]", "The applicant submits that had the officer not made these errors, he would have been awarded ten points under the arranged employment factor and five points under the adaptability factor.

This onus did not shift to the officer if the application or supporting material was ambiguous or insufficient. The respondent submits that the short video of the applicant's language skills was insufficient to alleviate the officer's concerns. The respondent also notes that this video does not show the applicant's ability to speak, listen to, read and write English. It only shows the applicant writing fifteen words, three of which were his name and does not show him listening to and responding to questions or demonstrate his reading skills."], ["[30]", "In addition, the applicant's unverifiable letters and writing sample were inadequate proof that he wrote them and did not demonstrate his claimed level of English proficiency. It was thus reasonable for the officer to find that this evidence was insufficient to determine whether the applicant met the requisite benchmarks."], ["[31]", "Finally, with regards to the applicant's double counting argument, the respondent notes that he relies in support on a 1998 case. That case is not applicable as it pertained to the previous immigration regulations and not the current Regulations. The respondent submits that the visa officer was required to determine whether the applicant was capable of performing the employment contemplated. In the case of a cook working in a commercial kitchen, the officer reasonably determined that some English language proficiency was necessary to operate equipment safely and to communicate with authorities in emergency situations. Concurrently, the officer was required to make a separate assessment of language proficiency.

Points awarded on AEOs are regulated under paragraph 82(2)(c) of the Regulations."], ["[36]", "As indicated, where an applicant does not intend to work in Canada before being issued a permanent resident visa and does not yet hold a work permit, the officer must assess whether the applicant is able to perform and likely to accept and carry out the employment described in an approved offer of employment (i.e., the AEO). An offer of employment is prepared by the prospective employer. The approval of the offer of employment then depends on an opinion provided by the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development (i.e., Service Canada). This opinion must be based on the genuineness of the offer of employment, the nature of the employment (i.e., not part-time or seasonal) and the wages offered."], ["[37]", "Thus, the statutory regime leaves the description of the specific employment duties and requirements up to the employer, subject only to the limitations that the employment not be part-time or seasonal and that the wages meet Canadian standards. In fact, in its guidance document to employers preparing job descriptions, Service Canada highlights the importance of clearly defining health or safety hazards associated with the employment. As such, the specification of these types of requirements is left to the employer."], ["[38]", "Nevertheless, recognizing the significant deference owed to visa officers on their exercise of discretion under paragraph 82(2)(c) of the Regulations, the jurisprudence has clearly established that an approved offer of employment, or AEO, from Service Canada does not eliminate the officer's duty to assess whether the applicant is able to perform the work outlined therein.

Here, the AEO merely specified that the applicant needed to have basic English oral proficiency to complete the employment. No English writing or reading skills were specified. Nevertheless, the officer found that the applicant's proposed employer would not be able to ensure that an English speaking person was always present while the applicant was working. The officer therefore concluded that in addition to the basic English oral proficiency, the applicant would require sufficient English proficiency to be able to read English safety equipment instructions in the kitchen and to communicate with Canadian authorities in case of accidents or emergencies. The officer found that these requirements were important in assessing whether the applicant could perform and carry out the proposed employment and thereby become economically established in Canada."], ["[42]", "In finding that the applicant required English reading to perform and carry out the employment, the officer incorporated a requirement not specified in the AEO. Although the ability to read and understand safety instructions and the ability to communicate with authorities in case of emergencies is clearly important and arguably applicable to most jobs, these requirements were not included in the AEO, the relevant statutory provisions or the policy guidelines.

I accept the applicants' evidence that there are many qualified applicants in the backlog. Notably, Mr. McNamee gave evidence that, even up to the date the backlog was terminated, the backlog was successfully mined to find qualified applicants for the Provincial Nominee Program. Additionally, approximately one-third of all FSW permanent resident visas in 2011 were issued to applicants in the backlog. These visas would not have been issued if the applicants were not qualified. However, the date of application is not an enumerated or analogous ground and so stereotyping on this basis does not constitute discrimination."], ["[137]", "Section 87.4 must be considered in light of the wider immigration context.

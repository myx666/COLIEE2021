In practice, it is therefore clear that the determination of the status of 'refugee' or of a 'person in need of protection' does not depend on 'the consideration of numerous interests simultaneously, and the promulgation of solutions which concurrently balance benefits and costs for many different parties'.

As noted in the", "Citizenship and Immigration Canada Manual", "for PRRA officers, PP-03 \"Pre-removal Risk Assessment (PPRA)\" at 11.02, \"One of the implicit assumptions about PRRA is that the PRRA decision-maker will become, over time and through experience, very knowledgeable on many countries.\" As such, a significant degree of deference should be given to conclusions on country conditions. Furthermore, with respect to other facts necessary to complete the assessment, the Court is in no better position than the PRRA officer, and if an oral interview is conducted, is arguably in a worse position to determine the facts. A high degree of deference should be shown to this sort of expertise.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "By contrast, the PRRA officers do not have the same level of expertise regarding questions of law as does this Court.

This is not the case here. In my view, very little deference ought to be shown to the expertise of PRRA officers on such legal questions as determination of jurisdiction or interpretation of the relevant law.

Somewhat more deference should nonetheless be shown in cases where the PRRA officer is dealing with questions of mixed fact and law for which they can be expected to have some knowledge, training, and experience, such as the application of the legal definition of protected person to the facts of a given case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "Combining and balancing all of these factors, I conclude that in the judicial review of PRRA decisions the appropriate standard of review for questions of fact should generally be patent unreasonableness, for questions of mixed law and fact, reasonableness simpliciter, and for questions of law, correctness.

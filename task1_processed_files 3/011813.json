The Senior Deputy Commissioner denied Mr. Spidel's third-level grievance regarding the refusal of the Warden of Ferndale Institution to approve his nomination for a position on the Inmate Committee at the Institution."], ["[2]", "For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that Mr. Spidel's application for judicial review is moot as a consequence of his transfer from Ferndale Institution. However, both the Warden's decision and the decision of the Senior Deputy Commissioner may have ongoing collateral consequences for Mr. Spidel. As a consequence, I am satisfied that it is in the interest of justice that the application be determined on its merits. I have further concluded that Mr. Spidel was not treated fairly in relation to his grievance, and that the decision of the Senior Deputy Commissioner was unreasonable. As a result, the application for judicial review will be allowed.", "Background"], ["[3]", "Mr. Spidel is a federal inmate serving a life sentence for second-degree murder. He was incarcerated in Ferndale Institution for a number of years and had served on the Institution's Inmate Committee, including a term as Chair of the Committee. In late 2009, there were new elections for the Inmate Committee, and Mr. Spidel nominated himself for a position on the Committee."], ["[4]", "Mr. Spidel subsequently received a letter from the Warden dated December 29, 2009 informing him that the Warden would not approve Mr. Spidel's nomination. The Warden relied upon Commissioner's Directive 083, which sets out the criteria for Inmate Committee members. One of the criteria is that the inmate \"has demonstrated a commitment to reasonably resolve issues in conjunction with the institution's management team as well as with the other members of the Inmate Committee.\""], ["[5]", "In refusing to approve his nomination, the Warden advised Mr. Spidel that:", "I believe that you become over-involved in issues. You demonstrate an over-confidence in the correctness of your position to the point where you cannot accept a differing opinion. In your specific case these are behaviors that are concerning as they are thinking errors that contributed to your index offence."], ["[6]", "The Warden noted that a 2006 psychological report made reference to positive changes made by Mr. Spidel, but cautioned that it was important that he \"continue to challenge and modify the thinking styles related to his index offence\". The report counseled Mr. Spidel to avoid overconfidence and \"over-involvement in helping others manage their daily lives\". The Warden went on to state that Mr. Spidel's past performance representing inmates raised concerns about the \"thinking styles\" referred to in the psychological report. The Warden suggested that Mr. Spidel should focus his attention on his personal progress rather than become overly involved in other inmates' issues."], ["[7]", "Mr. Spidel grieved the Warden's decision. He noted that the Warden had failed to provide him with an opportunity to make representations with respect to the prohibition on his participation in the Inmate Committee, as required by section 77 of the", "Corrections and Conditional Release Act", ", SC 1992, c 20 [CCRA] and subsection 99(2)(b) of the", "Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations", ", SOR/92-620 [CCRR]."], ["[8]", "Mr. Spidel further asserted that the Warden's refusal to approve his nomination violated his Charter rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. He claimed that the Warden's authority to deny inmates' nominations for committees was limited to situations where there were issues of safety or security. Mr. Spidel also disputed the Warden's statement that he had not demonstrated a commitment to resolving problems, pointing to his positive evaluations with respect to his work with other inmates and the success of his past work on the Inmate Committee, which post-dated the psychological report relied upon by the Warden."], ["[9]", "Because the decision in issue had been made by the Warden, it was immediately forwarded for second-level review. The grievance was denied at the second level on May 28, 2010 on the basis that the Warden had the authority to reject the Applicant's nomination pursuant to paragraph 22 of the Directive. The analysis also noted that management felt that during his tenure as Chair of the Inmate Committee, Mr. Spidel had not represented the population of Ferndale Institution and had not accurately and impartially presented information to the inmates in the Institution. The second-level decision does not address Mr. Spidel's claim that he had not been afforded an opportunity to make representation with respect to the Warden's decision."], ["[10]", "Mr. Spidel then took the matter to the third level of the grievance process. He raised essentially the same arguments as in his initial grievance, but provided a considerable amount of supporting documentary evidence including evaluations of his performance and an inmate petition signed by most of the inmates at Ferndale Institution supporting his candidacy for the Inmate Committee."], ["[11]", "Mr. Spidel stated in his third-level submissions that he had been unable to locate any information in his file suggesting that he had not properly represented the population of Ferndale Institution while he was on the Inmate Committee, or that he had not accurately and impartially presented information to inmates. Mr. Spidel asked that the Warden issue him a written apology for the violation of his rights and that the Warden's letter be expunged from his record."], ["[12]", "The grievance was denied at the third level on October 7, 2010 in a decision rendered by the Senior Deputy Commissioner of the CSC. The decision noted Mr. Spidel's contention that there was no documentary evidence supporting the allegation that he had proven himself incapable of working in conjunction with the management of Ferndale Institution or with inmates. However, the decision stated that Mr. Spidel's \"ability to work with staff to resolve issues might not be wholly documented as it is reliant on the personal relationship that you have developed with staff and particularly with the IH [Institutional Head or Warden]\"."], ["[13]", "The Senior Deputy Commissioner further determined that the Warden had the authority to reject Mr. Spidel's nomination pursuant to Commissioner's Directive 083, and that the Warden's letter explained the reasons for the refusal. Finally, the Senior Deputy Commissioner's decision held that the right to participate in inmate committees was not protected by either the Charter or the CCRA. Once again, no reference is made in the decision to Mr. Spidel's claim that he had not been afforded an opportunity to make representation with respect to the Warden's decision.", "Is the Application for Judicial Review Moot?"], ["[14]", "A few days before the hearing of this application, the respondent brought a motion seeking to have the application summarily dismissed on the basis that it had become moot as a result of Mr. Spidel's transfer out of Ferndale Institution. Mr. Spidel was initially transferred from Ferndale (a minimum security institution), to Mission Institution (which is a medium security institution)."], ["[15]", "Mr. Spidel then brought an application for habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of British Columbia with respect to his reclassification and transfer. Before the matter could be finally determined by the Court, the CSC agreed to return Mr. Spidel to a minimum security institution and a consent order was issued to that effect. It appears that the CSC also agreed to rescind the information on Mr. Spidel's file that led up to his reclassification and transfer to a higher security institution. Mr. Spidel is presently incarcerated at the Kwìkwèxwelhp Healing Lodge which is another minimum security institution."], ["[16]", "Mr. Spidel filed a lengthy record responding to the respondent's mootness motion, which included copies of five affidavits that had been prepared in connection with the habeas corpus application. Two affidavits were from a psychologist, two were from a social worker, and one was from a retired Social Program Officer. All of these individuals had worked with Mr. Spidel at Ferndale Institution."], ["[17]", "I do not intend to review each of the affidavits in detail. Suffice it to say that the picture painted by the evidenced adduced by Mr. Spidel is troubling. While I understand that other evidence was put before the British Columbia Supreme Court by the respondent to justify the decision to reclassify and transfer Mr. Spidel, the affidavits before me suggest that the Warden of Ferndale Institution had become very irritated by Mr. Spidel as a result of grievances that he had brought, and that a variety of retaliatory measures were taken by the Warden against Mr. Spidel, including the abolition of a mental health program in order to justify the firing of Mr. Spidel."], ["[18]", "Each of the affiants attests to the positive relationship that he had with Mr. Spidel and of the good work that Mr. Spidel had done within Ferndale Institution. Two of the affiants state that they were not aware of the issues or concerns that were relied upon to justify Mr. Spidel's transfer, despite the fact that they had worked closely with Mr. Spidel."], ["[19]", "Two affidavits were provided by the psychologist who authored the document relied upon by CSC to justify the transfer. He deposes that he had been told that \"management wanted Mr. Spidel gone and they wanted an assessment report ... that would assist in accomplishing this end\". While the psychologist says that he did not provide such a report at that time, he later drafted the note that provided the justification for moving Mr. Spidel. The psychologist swears that he was misled with respect to the alleged behavior of Mr. Spidel, and that he did not take any steps to confirm what he had been told by CSC management before writing the note in question."], ["[20]", "As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , mootness is a policy or practice that allows a court to decline to decide cases that do not involve a live controversy between the parties, but raise only hypothetical or abstract questions."], ["[21]", "According to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the live controversy must exist, not only at the time that the application for judicial review is commenced, but also at the time that the Court is called upon to reach a decision. As a result, if intervening events extinguish the live controversy between the parties after the application for judicial review is commenced, a case will become moot."], ["[22]", "I am satisfied that this application is moot. The underlying controversy between Mr. Spidel and the CSC related to whether or not Mr. Spidel could stand for election as a member of the Inmate Committee at Ferndale Institution. With his transfer out of Ferndale, Mr.Spidel is no longer eligible to serve on the Institution's Inmate Committee. Thus that controversy is no longer a live one."], ["[23]", "However, even if it is determined that a case is moot, it is open to the Court to exercise its discretion to hear the matter. In my view, this is an appropriate case for the exercise of that discretion."], ["[24]", "While it is not necessary for me to make an express finding in this regard, the uncontradicted affidavit evidence before me suggests that the involuntary transfer of Mr. Spidel out of Ferndale Institution may have been taken in retaliation for Mr. Spidel having used the grievance process to challenge management decisions."], ["[25]", "Moreover, I am satisfied that even if Mr. Spidel can no longer stand for election to a position on the Inmate Committee at Ferndale Institution, there may be collateral consequences arising out of both the Warden's decision and the decision under review that provides the necessary adversarial context for this proceeding."], ["[26]", "In this regard I note that in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court noted that one of the principles underlying the principle of mootness is that a court's competence to resolve legal disputes is rooted in the adversary system, which helps guarantee that issues are well and fully argued by parties who have a stake in the outcome."], ["[27]", "The Supreme Court went on to observe, however, that this requirement may be satisfied even where the live controversy has ceased to exist \"if, despite the cessation of a live controversy, the necessary adversarial relationships will nevertheless prevail\". As an example of where this will occur, the Court cited situations where \"although the litigant bringing the proceeding may no longer have a direct interest in the outcome,", "there may be collateral consequences of the outcome that will provide the necessary adversarial context", ".\" [Emphasis added, at para. 31]"], ["[28]", "In this case, the result of the third level grievance decision is that the Warden's December 29, 2009 decision remains on Mr. Spidel's correctional file. The Warden's letter makes negative comments about Mr. Spidel's conduct which, the respondent conceded, could potentially have negative consequences for him down the road."], ["[29]", "In these circumstances, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to exercise my discretion to deal with Mr. Spidel's application for judicial review on its merits.", "Standard of Review"], ["[30]", "There are two issues on the application for judicial review. The first is whether Mr. Spidel was treated fairly in the grievance process. Where an issue of procedural fairness arises, the task for the Court is to determine whether the process followed by the decision-maker satisfied the level of fairness required in all of the circumstances: see", "Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 43. In addition to Mr. Spidel's common law procedural fairness rights, consideration must be given in this case to the procedural rights afforded to inmates through the relevant legislative provisions."], ["[31]", "Insofar as the merits of the third level grievance decision are concerned, the decision should be reviewed against the standard of reasonableness. Such decisions are highly dependant on their facts, and CSC personnel are better situated than the Court to make and review decisions arising in the carceral setting."], ["[32]", "In reviewing a decision against the reasonableness standard, the Court must consider the justification, transparency and intelligibility of the decision-making process, and whether the decision falls within a range of possible acceptable outcomes which are defensible in light of the facts and the law: see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 47, and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para. 59.", "Was Mr. Spidel Treated Fairly?"], ["[33]", "Section 99 of the", "Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations", "provides that:", "99.

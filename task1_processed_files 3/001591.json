The Federal Court of Appeal endorsed the reasons of the trial judge that the amount of the fine should reflect 'the severity of the law and yet sufficiently moderate to show the temperance of justice'. The level of the fine, Urie, J.A., indicated, could not be a token fine because this would 'be inconsistent with the gravity of the contraventions and might serve to encourage others to flout the law if it is to their financial advantage to do so'.", "\"¶ 22 This last statement by Urie, J.A., echoes the words of Justice Rouleau of this Court in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.)

Dubé, J., of this Court in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , (F.C.T.D.), also stressed the importance of deterrence as the principal factor in ensuring that those orders will not be breached again because 'if those who get caught were to get away unscathed that would encourage such activities and consequently destroy the intended effect of the laws that have been passed' (page 13, line b). Dubé, J., in assessing a fine, took into account the value of the counterfeit goods sold. He also ordered solicitor-client costs capped to a maximum.", "\"¶ 23 To close off on the issue of first principles, other relevant factors to be taken into account are whether the contempt offence is a first offence (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)) and the presence of any mitigating factors such as good faith or apology (", "Baxter Travenol Laboratories", ", supra).\""], ["[16]", "To summarize, the factors relevant to determining a sentence in contempt proceedings are:", "i. The primary purpose of imposing sanctions is to ensure compliance with orders of the court. Specific and general deterrence are important to ensure continued public confidence in the administration of justice;", "ii. Proportionality of sentencing requires striking a balance between enforcing the law and what the Court has called \"temperance of justice\";", "iii. Aggravating factors include the objective gravity of the contemptuous conduct, the subjective gravity of the conduct (i.e. whether the conduct was a technical breach or a flagrant act with full knowledge of its unlawfulness), and whether the offender has repeatedly breached orders of the Court; and", "iv. Mitigating factors might include good faith attempts to comply (even after the breach), apologize or accept responsibility, or whether the breach is a first offence."], ["[17]", "This is a case where the respondent has ignored the RFIs.

Nor has the respondent appeared before this court to account for her failure to comply with Shore, J.'s, compliance order. Nor has the respondent indicated remorse for her conduct or given her undertaking to comply with the compliance order. I can only conclude that the respondent's conduct is attributable to ill will to the CRA or the Minister and/or a disregard for this Court's authority requiring her to provide the requested documents and information.

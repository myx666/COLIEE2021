After discovering that she was pregnant, the applicant claims he proposed to her in March 2004. She later gave birth to their daughter on July 30, 2004. The couple married on June 4, 2005, ten days before Ms. Antoine was removed from the country following a negative refugee claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The applicant applied to sponsor his wife, but this application was denied on July 10, 2006.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "While waiting for an appeal before the Board, the applicant visited his wife in December 2006 and again in December 2007. Following this visit, his wife gave birth to another daughter on September 7, 2007. Since his wife has been in Grenada, the applicant has regularly sent money to support her and their children.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The applicant also has a child born on January 1, 2005, that was, he claims, the result of a one-time sexual encounter with a neighbour. He has the support amounts for this child garnished from his wages.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Procedural History  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The applicant has a long history of litigation concerning the sponsorship of his wife.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "In July 10, 2006, a visa officer found that the couple's marriage was not genuine. The officer was concerned that Ms. Antoine lacked knowledge of her sponsor. The officer also found problems with the date of the marriage, as the couple married two weeks before Ms. Antoine was deported from Canada, the lack of evidence on cohabitation and the unconvincing nature of the documentary evidence supporting the relationship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "The applicant's appeal of the visa officer's decision was heard by the Board on April 15, 2008. The Board gave considerable weight to the fact that the couple have two children together. However, it found that this was not sufficient to discharge the onus of proving a genuine marriage. The Board found that the marriage was not genuine and was entered into primarily to assist Ms. Antoine in gaining status in Canada as a permanent resident. The Board highlighted the lack of documentary evidence supporting the claim of cohabitation, the evidence of communication between the couple was limited, the applicant's trips to Grenada were arranged only after the visa officer, during Ms. Antoine's interview, expressed concerns about the lack of visits, the applicant displayed a lack of knowledge about Ms. Antoine, the money sent by the applicant to Grenada \"could be for any number of reasons\", there is nothing in the immigration notes to show that the applicant attended any of Ms. Antoine's interviews with immigration officials prior to her removal and the couple married only days before her removal from Canada. The Board was not convinced the couple was in a committed and exclusive relationship because the applicant fathered a child with another woman at a time when he was in a relationship with Ms. Antoine.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The applicant appealed the Board decision and Mr. Justice James O'Reilly allowed the judicial review in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . He held that the Board's treatment of the evidence was unsatisfactory and therefore unreasonable. Mr. Justice O'Reilly found that the applicant attempted to address many of the Board's concerns in his testimony, but that these explanations were not considered. Specifically, the applicant explained the lack of evidence of cohabitation and the short duration of phone calls. He addressed the \"one-night stand\" he had with another woman, which produced a child. Mr. Justice O'Reilly found that the applicant had presented evidence supporting his continued relationship with Ms. Antoine and that there was no basis for the Board to suggest that the two relationships were the same. Mr. Justice O'Reilly concluded that the failure to consider the applicant's explanations for many of the issues and to mischaracterize other evidence went to the reasonableness of the decision. He found that while it was open to the Board to question the cogency of the applicant's explanations, it had a duty to at least consider them.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The Board's Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "The Board conducted a", "de novo", "appeal on January 14, 2010. Once again, the Board found that the marriage was not bona fide and was entered into primarily for the purpose of gaining status or privilege under the Act.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "The Board was concerned by the lack of additional evidence, other than the testimony of the applicant, demonstrating a genuine relationship from June 2002 to June 2005. There are no pictures from this time and no witnesses were called to confirm the relationship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "In response to this concern, the applicant claimed that any pictures he had of their time together in Canada were lost in the mail when he attempted to send them to the visa office. Ms. Antoine, however, claimed that these photos were lost in the move. The Board finds that this contradiction casts serious doubt on the evidence that these two individuals had a long term relationship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "With regards to the timing of the marriage, the Board questioned why the applicant had waited so long before marrying Ms. Antoine. The applicant claims that he proposed to Ms. Antoine in March 2004 and their daughter was born in July 2004, but the couple did not marry until June 2005. The Board found that logistical problems such as cost and location must not have been a problem, because they were married in a small ceremony at Ms. Antoine's apartment. Rather, the Board concludes that the parties delayed marriage until it was certain that the applicant would not be allowed to remain in Canada and as such, the marriage was directly related to the immigration problems faced by Ms. Antoine.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "The Board recognized that the applicant voluntarily sent money on a monthly basis to Ms. Antoine, but the Board did not believe that this led, on its own, to a finding of a bona fide marriage between the applicant and Ms. Antoine.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "The Board also took serious issue with the fact that the applicant fathered a child with another woman shortly after the birth of his first child with Ms. Antoine. He has support for this child garnished from his wages as result of a court order. The applicant testified that this child was as a result of a \"one-night stand\" and that Ms. Antoine was aware of the situation. The Board noted, however, that he failed to present any other evidence, such as his wife's testimony or the court order for his garnished child support to support his claims about the nature of the relationship with the other woman. The Board found that the evidence presented by the applicant lacked credibility.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "The Board was also not convinced of the bona fide nature of the marriage because of the applicant's infrequent visits to see his wife and children in Grenada. At the time of the Board hearing in November 2009, the last time he had visited Grenada was in January 2008. The applicant testified that he has not gone back since then because he could not afford to do so. The Board believed that if he was truly in a bona fide relationship, \"he would have done everything he possibly could\" to go back to Grenada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "Although the applicant submitted lengthy phone records to demonstrate contact with his wife, the Board was concerned that calls to Grenada usually lasted only one minute. The applicant testified that he would normally call to see if Ms. Antoine was home and then call her back using a calling card, which was much cheaper. The applicant did not, however, provide evidence of these calling cards or trace the numbers called using these cards. Therefore, the Board found that the applicant failed to adequately explain why the calls were short and why there was no other communication, other than the occasional letter or card.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "For the Board, however, the \"most telling evidence\" was that in response to Minister's counsel's questions, the applicant stated, \"I would not have gotten her [Ms. Antoine] pregnant if I did not love her.\" Minister's counsel pointed out that he also got the mother of his child born in January 2005 pregnant as well, but the applicant could not explain the difference between the two relationships. The Board believed that this comment undermined the applicant's claims that the marriage was genuine.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "Finally, the Board notes that the applicant did not accompany Ms. Antoine to any of her immigration interviews that immediately preceded her deportation. The Board would expect that in a bona fide relationship, the applicant would have been there to support his spouse.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "The Board concludes that although the fact that the couple has two children together is important, this does not necessarily lead to the finding of a bona fide marriage. The applicant did not fulfill his onus of providing enough evidence to convince the tribunal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "The issues are as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "1. What is the applicable standard of review?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "2. Did the Board exhibit a reasonable apprehension of bias?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "3. Did the Board err in its finding that the applicant's marriage was not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Applicant's Written Submissions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "The applicant submits the Board exhibited a reasonable apprehension of bias and failed to act impartially, have an open mind or provide a fair hearing by accepting into evidence material submitted in support of the earlier judicial review, including the transcript of the previous hearing. This was despite the fact that the first Board decision was remitted back by the Federal Court due to mischaracterizations of evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "The applicant further submits that the Board erred on several grounds failing to pay heed to Mr. Justice O'Reilly's decision and failing to correct the errors made in interpreting the evidence. As a result, the applicant submits that there are so many errors in the decision that it affected the outcome.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "Specifically, the applicant is concerned about the Board's findings pertaining to the following issues.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "The applicant submits that the Board erred in finding that there was a lack of evidence of a relationship from June 2002 to June 2005. The applicant included a sworn affidavit explaining both the relationship and the reasons for the lack of evidence of the relationship. The Board had a duty to analyze all the evidence and explain why it prefers to rely on other materials. Further, the fact that he did not call witnesses to confirm his relationship should not be fatal to his appeal. The Board had no real reason for rejecting his explanations in testimony and affidavits because there was no conflicting evidence, the explanations were not implausible and they were consistent with rationality and common sense.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "The applicant submits that he adequately explained the factors affecting the timing of the marriage and it was an error to draw a negative inference from the timing. He also explained the lack of evidence of communication between the applicant and his wife.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "The applicant submits that the Board's decision ignores the holding of Mr. Justice O'Reilly that there was no basis for characterizing the money sent as anything other than support for his wife and children.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "The applicant submits that the finding concerning his \"one-night stand\" ignores Mr. Justice O'Reilly's statements that there was no basis to suggest that the two relationships were the same.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "The applicant further submits that it was unreasonable for the Board to find that the applicant's claims of financial restraints were not enough to justify the infrequency of his visits to his wife and children.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[32]", "The applicant submits that the Board erroneously relied on documents concerning his wife's sister and not his wife in finding that the applicant did not support his wife in the immigration process. The applicant's affidavit makes it clear that he understood his wife's immigration status and the possibility of her removal early in his relationship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Respondent's Submissions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[33]", "The respondent submits that the applicant failed to show that an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, would conclude that it is more likely than not that the decision maker would not decide fairly, which is the test set out by the Supreme Court for the reasonable apprehension of bias (see", "Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 394). The applicant has not provided any concrete examples to support his allegation that the Board was biased.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[34]", "The respondent submits that none of the errors alleged by the applicant give rise to an arguable case for judicial review when analyzed either individually or as a whole.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[35]", "The respondent submits that the Board did not ignore the applicant's testimony about his contact with his wife, but that there was no other evidence to demonstrate their relationship before their marriage. Furthermore, the applicant gave contradictory evidence and it was reasonable for the Board to conclude that these contradictions undermined the applicant's credibility on this issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[36]", "The respondent submits that the Board's concerns about the timing of the applicant's marriage are reasonable and were not adequately addressed by the applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[37]", "The respondent submits that the Board's conclusion that the support is only for the support of the children is reasonable, particularly considering that the applicant is also paying child support to his child born to another woman.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[38]", "The respondent submits that it was reasonable for the Board to have concerns about the applicant's relationship with another woman with whom he had a child. The applicant failed to provide evidence other than his own testimony and where credibility is a concern, it is not unreasonable for the Board to require corroborating evidence (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[39]", "The respondent calculated that the applicant had sufficient funds to visit his wife and children and it was reasonable for the Board to state that if there was a genuine relationship, he would have done so.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[40]", "Ultimately, the respondent submits that it is up to the applicant to provide evidence that he was communicating with his wife. His failure to provide convincing evidence that explained the brevity of phone calls and lack of mail or e-mails meant that the Board's findings that this evidence indicated a lack of genuineness in the relationship was reasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[41]", "In conclusion, the respondent highlights that the Board is entitled to make credibility findings based on contradictions in the evidence. The applicant's claim to a genuine marriage with his spouse was seriously undermined by the contradictions and lack of corroborating evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Analysis and Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[42]", "Issue 1  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "What is the appropriate standard of review?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Where previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 57).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[43]", "Assessments of applications for permanent residence under the family class and genuineness of the marriage in particular, involve questions of mixed fact and law and the established standard of review is reasonableness (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 80 at paragraph 12).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[44]", "I wish to first deal with Issue 3.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[45]", "Issue 3  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Did the Board err in its finding that the applicant's marriage was not genuine and entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "I have reviewed the Board's decision that the applicant's and Ms. Antoine's marriage was not bona fide and was entered into primarily for the purpose of getting status or privilege under the Act. I do not agree that the Board's decision was reasonable for the reasons that follow.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[46]", "The Board found that the applicant's and Mrs. Antoine's decision to get married just before she was removed to Grenada led to the conclusion that the marriage was because of Ms. Antoine's immigration problems. However, the applicant explained to the Board that he had proposed in March 2004 and that he and Ms. Antoine had been preparing for the wedding since before she received her notice of removal and her negative PRRA decision. I find the Board's handling of this explanation to be based on speculation that the delay could not have been about financial issues because Ms. Antoine quit her job after she became pregnant. However, the applicant testified throughout the hearing that he had financial difficulties. Ms. Antoine's leaving her job because of pregnancy does not imply that the applicant did not have financial concerns.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[47]", "Further, the Board's decision seemed to say that the support payments made by the applicant to his family in Grenada did not necessarily demonstrate a bona fide marriage because he also made Court ordered support payments to the mother of his child through the \"one night stand.\" I do not accept that these two situations can be analogized. For example, the payments made to the applicant's wife and children in Grenada were voluntary. Further, I do not believe that the Court ordered support payments can have any impact on the assessment of the", "bona fides", "of the applicant's marriage. As such, I find this aspect of the decision to be unreasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[48]", "I do not accept that simply because the applicant had what he called a \"one night stand\" would support a conclusion that the marriage was not valid.

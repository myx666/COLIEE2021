The Board gave little weight to the birth certificate because \"a fraudulent birth certificate is an easily obtained document\". In the Applicant's view, the Board ought to have submitted the document for forensic testing before dismissing it as fraudulent. I do not agree. In spite of claiming to have been in China for two years, the Applicant had absolutely no other documents to prove his identity or presence in China. In light of the lack of any corroborating documents, it was not unreasonable for the Board to conclude that the birth certificate - a document that could easily be fraudulent - was not determinative of his identity."], ["[13]", "In sum, I am satisfied that the Board reached a reasonable conclusion based on the limited number of identity documents that had been submitted by the Applicant and the problems with those that he did produce."], ["[14]", "Where identity is not established, it is unnecessary to further analyze the evidence and the claim must fail (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J.

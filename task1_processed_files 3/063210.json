The applicants sought relief in the form of an order setting aside the decision under review, a declaration regarding the validity of sections 48 and 52 of the", "Immigration Act", "(the \"", "Act", "\") [see footnote 2] in the circumstances of the applicants, and an order enjoining the respondent from removing the applicants to their country of nationality, Chile \"... until such time as they no longer face a risk of cruel and unusual treatment in Chile.\""], ["[4]", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED concluded at FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED of his reasons, in the following terms:", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED"], ["[5]", "The applicants submitted an application for landing from within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, referred to by Mr. Justice Cullen as a \"s. 114(2) application[s]\" within the time provided by Mr. Justice Cullen. That application for landing from within Canada was rejected by decision dated the 5th of August, 1999. It is that decision that is here under review.", "Background"], ["[6]", "As earlier indicated, the applicants are husband and wife and citizens of Chile. During the Pinochet Regime, the male applicant worked with the Chilean secret police in its Department of Clandestine Operations (\"Dicar\"). He left Dicar sometime in the spring or summer of 1977 when he alleges he was expelled. He has acknowledged that, while he was working with Dicar, its purpose was \"to persecute people who were opposed to the government\". He is alleged to have described the types of activities he was associated with as \"rapes, kidnaps, kidnappings, a person was buried - a person that died while he'd been interrogated, interrogation - tortures\". He apparently acknowledged participating in raids where he would knock down doors and place people in a corner and point a firearm at them while the premises were searched. He was apparently present at interrogations where torture took place, albeit that he described his role at such interrogations as that of a guard and note-taker. He infiltrated youth groups at churches."], ["[7]", "The female applicant joined the Chilean police in 1975. She acknowledged herself to be a firm supporter of the Pinochet Regime. Sometime in 1975, she too joined Dicar. After training, she worked with Dicar from January in 1976 to mid-April, 1977 when she resigned. She was present at \"violent questionings\" and described her specialty as \"... make-up, transfiguring and make-up detentions, surveillance, office work like to read reports\". She too took notes during interrogations involving torture."], ["[8]", "After leaving Dicar, both of the applicants cooperated with Amnesty International and with post-Pinochet Regime police who were investigating atrocities committed during the Pinochet Regime."], ["[9]", "Since coming to Canada, the applicants have apparently led exemplary lives. They have, together with their sons, substantially integrated into the Canadian community.", "The Decision Under Review"], ["[10]", "The decision under review denies the applicants the privilege of applying for landed status in Canada from within Canada. In essence, assuming they wish to remain in Canada, and that appears beyond doubt, it would require them to leave Canada and to apply from outside Canada for leave to return. In support of the decision under review, an immigration officer wrote [see footnote 3]:", "\"DECISION FOR FOSS.", "Fernando Alfonso Arduengo Naredo was interviewed on 30 October 1997 at CIC Mississauga. He has submitted an independent application under section 114(2) of the", "Immigration Act", ". He is requesting an exemption to section 9(1) of the", "Immigration Act", ". This includes his spouse, Nieves Del Carmen San Martin Salazar Arduengo.", "I have reviewed the application under all relevant guidelines.", "Mr. Arduengo has demonstrated his ability to integrate and become established in Canada. Mr. Arduengo has two Canadian born children, aged 22 and 18 years. I recognize his sons willingness to submit a family class appliction (sic). Having children born in Canada while their immigration status was undetermined and they possibly faced the requirement of having to leave Canada was a decision Mr. Arduengo took. It would also be their own decision if they were to leave their children, aged 22 and 18, in Canada. The parents are free to decide what would be in the best interests of the children. The children will retain their Canadian citizenship no matter where they reside.", "It is noted that the applicant has family in Chile. Mr. Arduengo has a widowed mother, a brother and two step-siblings, Mrs. Arduengo has a widowed mother, and two siblings in Chile.", "I have considered the letters of support on behalf of the applicant and family, and find them commendable. It is noted that the writers appear to be persons who have known the Arduengo's only since their arrival in Canada. However, there is no reference made in these letters to the Arduengo's activities prior to their entry to Canada.", "On 15TH January 1999 Mr. Arduengo received a positive risk opinion. I have reviewed the risk opinion by Jim Graham, PCDO Officer, GTEC, dated 15TH January 1999. In his summary he stated that risk exists as the Chilean Government hired a law firm to follow the Arduengo's case. The Chilean Government were willing to send officers to Canada to escort the Arduento's (sic) back to Chile.", "I have reviewed the following two articles: (1) Wall Street Journal, page A23, Thursday, July 22, 1999, entitled: \"International: Chilean Ruling Could Hurt Pinochet - Court Says Military Officials Can Face Prosecution\", and, (2) Financial Times, page 05, Thursday, July 22, 1999 - entitled \"Retired Chilean Offices (sic) to Face Kidnap Trial\".", "It would appear that while the Arduengo's might be escorted back to Chile, and may face charges, the Amnesty Laws would ensure that due process of law would be applied in their case, and there would be no or little risk of inhumane treatment, torture, or death.", "I accept the positive factors in this case. However, after considering the actions of Mr. and Mrs. Arduengo while they were members of the Dicar in Chile, an organization which can be considered one with a single, limited brutal purpose, and, considering the objectives of the", "Immigration Act", ", I am not satisfied that the H & C grounds in this case are sufficient to warrant processing this application from within Canada on an exceptional basis.\""], ["[11]", "The \"risk opinion\" referred to in the foregoing notes, which I take to be the reasons for the immigration officer's decision, appears at pages 46 to 49 of Volume 1 of the Tribunal Record. It would appear to sustain the applicants' fears on the basis of risk of reprisals against them by reason of their cooperation with Amnesty International and law enforcement agencies following their termination of their involvement with Dicar but to discount any fear by reason of actions against them to preclude any further disclosures. The officer providing the opinion writes:", "\"There (sic) fear now is reprisals for what they knew and divulged not what they know and remain mum about Their voice can no longer be silenced.\" [see footnote 4]"], ["[12]", "The officer further concludes that the applicants would face a risk if returned to Chile by reason of the \"crumbling\" of legal protections. He concludes in the following terms at page 49 in Volume 1 of the Tribunal Record:", "\"The fact that the Chilean Government would hire a law firm to track the outcome of this case in Canada, and be willing to send officers to Canada to escort this couple back to Chile suggest to me that a risk does exist. I had previously relied on the fact that the Amnesty Law protected human rights abusers from prosecution in Chile. This fact appears to be crumbling as the British Courts are entertaining the extradition of General Pinochet back to Chile to face charges. After considering this new information I am of the opinion that there is more than a mere possibility that a risk does exist to the Arduengos if returned to Chile.\" [see footnote 5]", "The Positions of the Parties"], ["[13]", "Counsel for the applicants urged with eloquence and at considerable length that the immigration officer erred in law in misapprehending the facts of the case, in ignoring evidence and in reaching conclusions unsupported by the evidence; erred in law in reaching an unreasonable decision, breached the duty of fairness in considering extrinsic evidence without advising the applicants or providing them an opportunity to reply to that evidence and further erred in law in rejecting the risk assessment, prepared by one presumably more expert than she in such matters, in reaching her decision."], ["[14]", "By contrast, counsel for the respondent urged that the immigration officer made no reviewable error. Counsel urged that, faced with a clear conflict between immigration objectives reflected in section 3 of the", "Act", ", against the standard of reasonableness simpliciter, the decision was reasonably open."], ["[15]", "The relevant portions of section 3 of the", "Act", "read as follows:", "\"3. It is hereby declared that Canadian immigration policy and the rules and regulations made under this Act shall be designed and administered in such a manner as to promote the domestic and international interests of Canada recognizing the need", ". . . . .", "(c) to facilitate the reunion in Canada of Canadian citizens and permanent residents with their close relatives from abroad;", ". . . . .", "(j) to promote international order and justice by denying the use of Canadian territory to persons who are likely to engage in criminal activity.", "\"3.

While to so interpret paragraph 3(j) is a stretch of the plain meaning of the words of that paragraph, I accept the position of counsel in the same manner in which I accept that paragraph 3(c) is broad enough to encompass the circumstances here before the Court.

In reaching that conclusion, I find it unnecessary to traverse the substantial range of issues placed before me on behalf of the applicants."], ["[18]", "On a review of the Tribunal Record, particularly those pages that appear to reflect the careful notes of the immigration officer making the decision, it is evident that the officer went to considerable trouble to comprehend the totality of the extensive material relating to these two applicants that was before her.

Indeed, at that time, he was very close to 19 years of age. The two sons of the applicants, whatever their ages, remained \"children\" of the applicants who could reasonably be expected to be dramatically affected by the removal from Canada of their parents."], ["[21]", "I repeat here from what I regard to be the reasons for decision, the comments of the immigration officer with respect to the children:", "\"Mr. Arduengo [and indeed, Ms. Arduengo as well] has two Canadian born children, aged 22 and 18 years.

It was not open to the immigration officer, against the guidance provided by", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", ", to simply leave the issue of what is in the best interests of the applicants' children to the applicants in circumstances where the applicants were about to be required to leave Canada to an uncertain fate in Chile. To do so, as was done here, was to be \"completely dismissive\" of the interests of the children. The immigration officer did not, herself, give \"serious weight and consideration to the interests of the children ...\".

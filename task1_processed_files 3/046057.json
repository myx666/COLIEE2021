The decision had apparently been made pursuant to the expedited hearing process. The CRDD panel at the hearing of 15 November 1993 (the \"15 November panel\") adjourned the matter pending an inquiry to the office of the CRDD Registrar.

Put another way, can the Board question or investigate the making of a decision which, on its face, appears to be valid? As noted above, the decision was properly signed, and stated that the matter was decided \"without a hearing\". The governing statute enables the CRDD to make decisions without hearings. It appears that a decision in the applicant's case was made without a hearing. A Notice of Decision was duly signed by the Registrar indicating that the claim was determined without a hearing on the 10th day of May 1993, and that the applicant was determined to be a Convention refugee.

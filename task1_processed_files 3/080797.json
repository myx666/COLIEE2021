In argument before me, counsel for CanWest attempted to argue that a positive ruling from this Court on the Application would have positive financial implications for CanWest. It argues that, if U.S. entities are prevented from publishing DTCA in U.S. media that now finds its way into Canada, pharmaceutical companies who wish to advertise in Canada would then choose to advertise, in legally permissible ways,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's media enterprises. In other words, they submit, the playing field would be levelled. The problem with this assertion is that it is based on pure speculation. There is nothing before me to indicate that CanWest would be the beneficiary of additional advertising revenue if investigations and prosecutions against U.S. media were pursued."], ["[17]", "Even if I were to assume that CanWest has a commercial interest in the outcome of the Application, I am still not persuaded that this would be enough to make it a party \"directly affected\". A commercial interest in the issues in a judicial review application, in and of itself, is not a sufficient basis for standing (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. (4th) 6 at para. 19, 143 A.C.W.S. (3d) 350).", "(b) Public Interest Standing"], ["[18]", "In cases where no direct standing can be established, the Courts have allowed, as a matter of judicial discretion, intervention by parties asserting a public interest. One of the clearest expressions of the policy reasons for when and where to allow public interest standing was that of Justice Cory in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 252 - 253, where he stated:", "The increasing recognition of the importance of public rights in our society confirms the need to extend the right to standing from the private law tradition which limited party status to those who possessed a private interest. In addition some extension of standing beyond the traditional parties accords with the provisions of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, I would stress that the recognition of the need to grant public interest standing in some circumstances does not amount to a blanket approval to grant standing to all who wish to litigate an issue. It is essential that a balance be struck between ensuring access to the courts and preserving judicial resources. It would be disastrous if the courts were allowed to become hopelessly overburdened as a result of the unnecessary proliferation of marginal or redundant suits brought by a well-meaning organizations pursuing their own particular cases certain in the knowledge that their cause is all important. It would be detrimental, if not devastating, to our system of justice and unfair to private litigants.", "The whole purpose of granting status is to prevent the immunization of legislation or public acts from any challenge. The granting of public interest standing is not required when, on a balance of probabilities, it can be shown that the measure will be subject to attack by a private litigant. The principles for granting public standing set forth by this Court need not and should not be expanded. The [page253] decision whether to grant status is a discretionary one with all that that designation implies. Thus undeserving applications may be refused. Nonetheless, when exercising the discretion the applicable principles should be interpreted in a liberal and generous manner."], ["[19]", "Acknowledging these principles, Justice Cory in", "Canadian Council of Churches", "applied a tri-partite test, which has been followed in other case (see, for example,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 33;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 51 (Ont.

In", "Canadian Council of Churches", ", Justice Cory accepted the genuine interest of the Council which, in his words, \"demonstrated a real and continuing interest in the problems of the refugees and immigrants\". It appears to me that an examination of this aspect of the test requires me to review the nature of CanWest's interest in this Application. In other words, does CanWest have a \"real and continuing interest\" in the maintenance and enforcement of the DTCA legislative scheme? In my view, the answer to this question is far from clear. The instigation of a proceeding in another Court to strike down the impugned provisions seems to be a strong statement that the continuing interest of CanWest is not to maintain the existing legislation but to remove barriers to its participation in the DTCA market."], ["[22]", "CanWest argues that the unfairness of the present situation, where it is forced to comply with the statutory scheme while U.S. entities are not, gives it a genuine interest in the outcome of the Application for judicial review. While CanWest may have a \"real\" interest at this time in trying to create a level playing field, I do not see this as sufficient, on these facts, to grant CanWest standing."], ["[23]", "Finally, CanWest argues that there is no reasonable and effective manner for the issue of the Respondents' failure to enforce its own laws to come to Court. If CanWest does not bring this application, it asserts, who will? CanWest contends that this is a situation, as described in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 449 (F.C.A.), where the matter raised by CanWest is one of \"strong public interest\" and \"there may be no other way such an issue could be brought to the attention of the court\" and, as such, standing should be granted to CanWest. I do not agree."], ["[24]", "The fact is that a coalition of a number of interested parties has already successfully sought intervener status  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's Charter challenge in opposition to CanWest. It seems evident that there are individuals and groups in Canada who are supportive of the DTCA prohibitions and who may have public interest standing to bring an application for judicial review in this Court to determine the issues (assuming that there are reviewable issues). There may be many reasons why there has been no pursuit of an order of", "mandamus", "in our Court by any other party. Failure, to date, by other parties (with, for example, no commercial interest or with broader health concerns) to seek", "mandamus", "does not elevate CanWest's interest to one of \"public interest\"."], ["[25]", "In sum, I am not persuaded that CanWest can meet any one of the aspects for public interest standing."], ["[26]", "However, even assuming that there are some arguments that CanWest meets the three criteria, the granting of public interest standing is a matter of judicial discretion. As stated by Justice Cory in", "Canadian Council of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 252-253. \"The decision whether to grant status is a discretionary one with all that that designation implies. Thus undeserving applications may be refused.\" In this case, there are strong reasons why I should not exercise my discretion. This is particularly so where the very party bringing the Application for judicial review is the same party that commenced the Charter challenge in a different Court. It is also difficult to understand how an interest in levelling the playing field is anything more than a private concern."], ["[27]", "Further, resolution of the CanWest Charter challenge would greatly enhance the ability of this Court to deal with the issues underlying the Application for judicial review. That is, knowing that the impugned provisions are not in violation of the Charter (if that is the outcome of the Charter challenge) would provide the Court with a proper legal foundation to assess submissions in an Application for judicial review. Such a conclusion could also provide other stakeholders (such as concerned individuals or public interest groups), who do not hold a possible commercial interest in the outcome, with an informed opportunity to seek", "mandamus", "through an Application for judicial review in the Federal Court. On the other hand, a finding by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice that the impugned provisions are contrary to the Charter could obviate the need for any judicial review. Although this argument could support an application for a stay of this Application, it also, in my view, goes to the question of standing and whether judicial discretion should be exercised. On the record before me, CanWest's standing and possible interest in the outcome of the judicial review is not likely to change as a result of its Charter challenge. Accordingly, rather than stay the Application for judicial review, the better option is to dismiss this Application for judicial review.", "Conclusion"], ["[28]", "In conclusion, I am not persuaded that CanWest has the requisite standing to bring this Application for judicial review.

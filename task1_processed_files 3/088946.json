This is the essence of the definition of \"threat to the security of Canada\" found in s. 2 of the", "Canadian Security Intelligence Service", "Act", "and reflects the comment previously cited in these reasons made by the Supreme Court of Canada in", "Suresh", ", above, on the meaning of \"danger to the security of Canada\" at paragraph 90 as follows:", "These considerations lead us to conclude that a person constitutes a 'danger to the security of Canada' if he or she poses a serious threat to the security of Canada, whether direct or indirect, and bearing in mind the fact that the security of one country is often dependent on the security of other nations. The threat must be 'serious', in the sense that it must be grounded on objectively reasonable suspicion based on evidence and in the sense that the threatened harm must be substantial rather than negligible.", "\" (Emphasis mine)", "and what constitutes \"terrorism\" at paragraph 98 of that same case where the Supreme Court of Canada wrote:", "\"In our view, it may safely be concluded, following the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, that", "'terrorism' in s. 19 of the", "Act", "includes any 'act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act'", ". This definition catches the essence of what the world understands by 'terrorism'. Particular cases on the fringes of terrorist activity will inevitably provoke disagreement. Parliament is not prevented from adopting more detailed or different definitions of terrorism. The issue here is whether the term as used in the", "Immigration Act", "is sufficiently [page 56] certain to be workable, fair and constitutional. We believe that it is.\" (Emphasis mine)"], ["[43]", "In particular, the Ministers' concern is that as a member of the Osama Bin Laden Network (the Network), if released, Mr. Almrei will be able to reconnect with his former associates thus enabling him to promote terrorism, and, specifically, the facilitation of the movement of Islamic extremists through the use of falsified documents.", "(1) The relevant detention review considerations"], ["[44]", "The point of departure in the analysis is a consideration and weighing of the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in", "Charkaoui, Re", ", above as necessary to justify extended periods of detention."], ["[45]", "As indicated above, five relevant factors were suggested. The dispute between the parties centers on the factors of reasons for detention and availability of alternatives to detention. My assessment of the relevant factors is as follows:", "(a)", "Reasons for Detention"], ["[46]", "Mr. Almrei's detention is justified by the Service in part on the basis he is a continuing threat to Canada's national security. The other aspect is that he is a flight risk. He would go underground, be a sleeper and resume terrorist-related activities, but not commit acts of violence in Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada indicated a threat to national security is an important factor for the purpose of justifying continued detention. It added \"the more serious the threat, the greater will be the justification for detention\"."], ["[47]", "The Ministers say Mr. Almrei represents a substantial threat to Canada's national security. Mr. Almrei argues he represents no such threat because he does not espouse the violent philosophy of Al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden which is the basis for the Ministers' case against him. For reasons discussed below under the heading \"Is Mr. Almrei a continuing danger to the security of Canada?\". I find that he represents a substantial continued threat to Canada's national security.", "(b) Length of Detention"], ["[48]", "The Supreme Court of Canada indicates length of detention to date is an important factor both from the perspective of the individual and from the perspective of national security. Mr. Almrei has been in detention for over six years now. The Ministers agree this factor weighs in favour of Mr. Almrei's release. They also recognize that his detention may have diminished the severity of the threat he poses but has not negated it.", "(c) Reasons for delay in deportation"], ["[49]", "Since Mr. Almrei has been found to be inadmissible to be in Canada and a removal order has been made against him, he is being detained by Canada pending his deportation. In its reasons, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that \"recourse by the government or the individual to applicable provisions of", "IRPA", "that are reasonable in the circumstances and recourse by the individual to reasonable", "Charter", "challenges should not count against either party. On the other hand, an unexplained delay or lack of diligence should count against the offending party\". Justice Layden-Stevenson found, in 2005, that Mr. Almrei's deportation from Canada was not a \"done deal\". She made that finding in the context of the process initiated by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the Minister) to obtain an opinion from a Minister's delegate that he could be deported to Syria, a country which the Immigration and Refugee Board had found in 2001 that he had a legitimate fear of persecution."], ["[50]", "The Canadian government previously had obtained two such opinions from two different Minister's delegates but those opinions were quashed by Judges of this Court on judicial review initiated by Mr. Almrei. One such opinion was set aside on consent. A third opinion, favourable to the government, has now been obtained but is the subject of judicial review proceedings, leave having been granted."], ["[51]", "As we also know, Mr. Almrei was one of the three appellants challenging the constitutionality of the security certificate scheme before the Supreme Court of Canada."], ["[52]", "I find that Mr. Almrei's challenges were reasonable and pursued with diligence as was the Ministers' defence of the statutory scheme. I do not find favour with counsel for Mr. Almrei's argument that some undue delay could be attributable to the Ministers because of its opposition to the appointment of an amicus curiae. I conclude this factor is neutral.", "(d) Anticipated future length"], ["[53]", "The Supreme Court of Canada held if future detention time cannot be ascertained this factor weighed in favour for release. The Ministers agree this factor favours Mr. Almrei. They conceded the time of his deportation cannot be ascertained. This is because of his judicial review of the Minister's delegate's opinion he should not be allowed to remain in Canada and may be deported to Syria. The Minister's delegate's opinion raises delicate questions in light of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in", "Suresh", ", above. The second reason the time of his deportation cannot be ascertained is because of the fallout from the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in", "Charkaoui, Re", ", above, particularly with reference to paragraph 140 of the reasons of that Court.", "(e) Availability of alternatives to deportation"], ["[54]", "In its judgment, the Supreme Court of Canada stated \"stringent release conditions, such as those imposed on Mr. Charkaoui and Harkat seriously limit individual liberty. However, they are less severe than incarceration. Alternatives to lengthy detention pursuant to a certificate, such as stringent release conditions, must not be a disproportionate response to the nature of the threat\". The Ministers' argue the conditions of release proposed by Mr. Almrei are inadequate and, indeed are the weakest release conditions ever presented to the Court for approval. On the other hand, Mr. Almrei argues the release conditions will be effective to contain the low level of threat he represents to national security and that it is impossible for him to put together a better package. For the reasons explained below, I find the conditions of release proposed by Mr. Almrei to be wholly inadequate.", "(f) Other factors"], ["[55]", "These five factors are non-exclusive. During his testimony Mr. Almrei referred to the difficult conditions of detention when he was incarcerated at the Metro-West Detention Centre (Metro-West) from October, 2001 to April, 2006. He makes no such claim about the conditions at the KIHC, particularly after the Chief Justice of this Court mediated a settlement of litigation initiated by the detainees concerning the conditions of detention there. I am prepared to recognize the difficult conditions of his past detention at Metro-West as a relevant factor favouring his release.", "(g) Conclusion"], ["[56]", "The weighing and balancing of all of these factors suggests that Mr. Almrei should be released from detention. The length of his detention he has now incurred and indeterminate future length of his detention in the future favour his release but for my finding the proposed conditions of his release will not, on a balance of probabilities, contain or diminish the risk he represents. Therefore, he cannot be released.", "(2) The standard of proof"], ["[57]", "The one area where counsel diverged on issues of law is on question of the applicable standard of proof required to enable the Ministers to discharge their burden of initially establishing Mr. Almrei continues to be a danger to Canada's security."], ["[58]", "Counsel for Mr. Almrei submits that each underlying fact or element that underpins the Ministers' view he remains a danger to national security must be established on a balance of probabilities.

But for the Ministers' belief that Mr. Jaballah is a danger to national security, there would be neither a security certificate nor detention. Mr. Jaballah's concession that he constitutes a danger to national security certainly expedited the detention review hearing. However, it is important to state that, if Mr. Jaballah had not conceded this point, I would have concluded that he is a danger to national security in any event. I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is sufficient credible and compelling information before me to found an objective basis that provides reasonable grounds to believe that he is such a danger.\""], ["[59]", "Counsel for the Ministers argue the test for the underlying facts is not on the balance of probabilities but on what Justice Layden-Stevenson stated in her reasons at paragraph 382 in", "Almrei", ", above:", "\"In the circumstances as I have described them and in view of the findings that I have made,", "I conclude that Mr. Almrei's participation in jihad (specific to him) gives rise to an objectively reasonable suspicion that Mr. Almrei did adopt the Islamic extremist ideology espoused by Osama bin Laden. This standard does not require proof of the existence of the facts. It requires reasonable grounds to believe. There must be a serious possibility that the facts exist based on reliable, credible evidence. However, I arrive at the same result on a balance of probabilities standard.", "My conclusion is reinforced by reference to evidence contained in the confidential information, a copy of which is attached as Schedule 'A' to an order signed contemporaneously with these reasons and order (the confidential order).\" (Emphasis mine)"], ["[60]", "Counsel for Mr. Almrei's reliance on", "Jaballah", ", above is, with respect, misplaced. In that case, Mr. Jaballah had conceded he was a danger to Canada's national security. What my colleague stated in", "Jaballah", "above, as she did in", "Almrei", ", at paragraph 382, is that she was satisfied there was sufficient credible and compelling information before her to have found an objective basis that provides reasonable grounds to believe that he is such a danger. Nowhere in her comment does Justice Layden-Stevenson say that the underlying facts must be established on the basis of a balance of probabilities. She stated the opposite. Moreover, in addition to applying the reasonable grounds to believe standard, looking at the totality of the evidence, she went on to express the view that the evidence disclosed Mr. Almrei was a danger to national security on the higher threshold of balance of probabilities. In other words, she found him to be a danger to national security on both standards.

My reasons for coming to this conclusion are as follows:", "- Erma Wolfe works full time on shift-work as a nurse. Currently, she works from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., working 75 hours during a two-week period on scattered days which may be two, three, or four days a week in a six-week rotating schedule.

She has never met Mr. Almrei personally although she attempted once to visit him when he was detained at Metro-West but failed. She has written him a few letters and communicates principally with him by telephone. In my view, she is not in a position to exercise a controlling influence over him. Moreover, the age gap between them is considerable;", "- She travels to Alberta to visit her grandchildren a couple of times a year. She has grandchildren in Metro-Toronto she visits often. This again creates an away-from-home situation although, it is true, Doctor Ralph said she and Jean Hansen would cover for her when she took holidays and would visit Toronto as often as they could which she said might be every month and half or two months. For his part, Mr. Ahmed testified he would visit Mr. Almrei three times a week for a couple of hours in the afternoon;", "- With respect, I do not believe Erma Wolfe really understands the onerous duties of being a principal supervisory surety. She must exercise effective supervision over Mr. Almrei which means a substantial commitment of time when she is at home. I did not hear that commitment from her when she testified. What I heard was that, except to do her laundry in the laundry room located in the basement of her house, she would keep locked the access door from the basement to the rest of her house where she lives. The effect is that, even if she is at home, Mr. Almrei would be alone in the basement apartment which has a separate side entrance.

In the circumstances of this case, I did not deem necessary to call CBSA officials because I considered the supervisory plan to be fundamentally flawed. The gaps it contained were too large to fill. I also had in mind two findings made by my colleagues. The first one is by Justice Dawson in connection with modifying the terms of his release. Justice Noël in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, indicated that Justice Dawson, in her September 26, 2006, order had expressly rejected the argument that since CBSA was monitoring Mr. Harkat there was no need for him to be with his supervising sureties while on approved outings. (See Justice Noël's decision reported at 2007 FC 416). Second, I have in mind Justice Layden-Stevenson's comment at paragraph 425 of her reasons that she was not convinced that law enforcement personnel, in the absence of an appropriate surety, can ensure compliance with the Court's order."], ["[97]", "Finally, I do not accept the argument put forward by his counsel that the supervisory plan offered by Mr. Almrei is the best possible that can be devised, given his particular circumstances. During the hearing, I made one suggestion which did not meet favour on possible legal or practical grounds. That option, perhaps may be worthy of exploration."], ["[98]", "I am far from being convinced that a supervisory plan cannot be put into place which minimizes or contains Mr. Almrei's risk of flight and risk to national security other than the plan which has been presented to the Court which, as I have said, fails to do either."], ["[99]", "Based on the continuum of the evidence described above and considering the evidence as a whole, I find the totality of that evidence grounds an objectively reasonable suspicion Mr. Almrei did adopt and has not renounced the ideology espoused by Osama Bind Laden and Al-Qaeda which constitutes a substantial threat to Canada's national security."], ["[100]", "The case before me is not substantially different than the one put before Justice Blanchard and more recently before Justice Layden-Stevenson. Indeed, when Mr. Almrei testified before her on July 20, 2005, Mr. Almrei denied sharing Osama Bin Laden's ideology, indicated he believed in the struggle in Afghanistan against the Soviet occupiers and their surrogate Afghan government and that the Al-Qaeda jihad of violence against civilians was contrary to Islam."], ["[101]", "There is no need for me to review the findings of Justice Blanchard and Layden-Stevenson. In particular, at paragraphs 347 to 402 she analysed and clearly expressed her findings in respect of Mr. Almrei's participation in jihad, his association with Arab-Afghans and his participation in document forgery which the evidence shows is a main tool used to cover up the travels of persons involved in international terrorism."], ["[102]", "I find that substantially the same evidence and arguments were made before me. Judicial comity mandates support of both Justice Blanchard and Justice Layden-Stevenson's findings. Moreover, my review of the entire evidentiary record shows that their conclusions were sound and unimpeachable when read in their totality."], ["[103]", "I conclude by saying that after scrutinizing the confidential information in the manner that I described, I then turned to Justice Layden-Stevenson's confidential order dated December 5, 2005 where she compiled an extensive list of reliable confidential information from various sources which were corroborated and upon which she relied to come to her conclusions. I am in complete agreement with the confidential information compiled in her confidential order in terms of both Schedule \"A\" and Schedule \"B\" to that order and make mine those schedules of her confidential order."], ["[104]", "I conclude the analysis of this item by stating that I do not find Mr. Almrei's testimony to be credible for the following reasons."], ["[105]", "First, he constantly lied or failed to disclose material information to Canadian officials or government agencies about his past activities."], ["[106]", "Second, the manner he testified before me was not reassuring. His curt and sharp answers suggested to me he was not truly forthcoming in his answers and was holding back. Justice Layden-Stevenson reached the same conclusion. My reading of Mr. Almrei's testimony before her supports my conclusion and hers. Mr. Almrei only revealed his true activities when he felt trapped. He economized the truth."], ["[107]", "Third, a comparison of the confidential information with his testimony demonstrates he continues to hide truth."], ["[108]", "Fourth, even on the public record, contradictions arise between his testimony and the previous testimony he gave on his earlier detention reviews. I cite in particular when and where he first met ibn-Khattab and how he obtained a photo of Mr. Bin Laden discovered when his computer was seized. He denied the guest house was controlled by Al-Qaeda yet he stated Osama Bin Laden may have financed it. The same can be said whether he had a reputation in the community as a person who knew how to obtain false documents."], ["[109]", "His testimony is not plausible in many respects. I cite as an example his testimony before Justice Layden-Stevenson that he did not fight in Afghanistan and his purported role during the scouting missions. The same may be said of his explanation why he had certain photos of personages on his computer. He minimized the importance of being able to communicate via satellite with ibn-Khattab. He also minimized the fact that he had been trained by Sayyaf may have been a factor which impressed Mr. Khattab when he asked him to join jihad in Tajikistan."], ["[110]", "His testimony whether and when he heard of Osama bin Laden is confusing when contrasted with his previous testimony, as is his testimony as to how many times he stayed at or visited Bait-al Ansar, the guest house he first stayed at in Peshawar in 1990.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[111]", "THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that:", "Mr. Hassan Almrei's application for release from detention is dismissed.", "Application dismissed.", "Editor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/gs", "[End of document]"]]}

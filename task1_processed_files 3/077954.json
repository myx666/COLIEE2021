It is very difficult for a trial judge to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events.

Even if the new evidence contradicts the facts as found, the decision maker sitting in appeal is still free to sustain the original decision.

Second, the Board noted that although the Appellant was convicted of assault for that same prior misconduct, nonetheless he failed to accept that he had a criminal record for it (Decision, p. 21).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The Board also noted that four witnesses (the DC, the potential supervisor, Cst. X and her fiancé) described the Appellant's loss of control or anger or rage, and that even the Appellant's mother testified that she had to admonish the Appellant for raising his voice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[62]", "Several observations emerge from this review of the allegations and the evidence on which they were based.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[63]", "First, Cst. Elhatton was the only witness to the allegations at issue (4, 5 and 6) for this judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[64]", "Second, because the evidence of Cst. Elhatton was accepted in respect of Allegation 1 (Mitten Incident), the Board concluded she was probably truthful in respect of the later incidents. There was thus an initial finding on credibility which cascaded through the later allegations. This reasoning is central to the Board's analysis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  on the perils inherent in making credibility findings in these circumstances:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The credibility of interested witnesses, particularly in cases of conflict of evidence, cannot be gauged solely by the test of whether the personal demeanour of the particular witness carried conviction of the truth. The test must reasonably subject his story to an examination of its consistency with the probabilities that surround the currently existing conditions. In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions. [...] Again a witness may testify what he sincerely believes to be true, but he may be quite honestly mistaken. For a trial Judge to say \"I believe him because I judge him to be telling the truth\", is to come to a conclusion on consideration of only half the problem. In truth it may easily be self-direction of a dangerous kind.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[65]", "Third, the evidence was given in the context of what was obviously a deteriorating marriage, which necessitates a certain caution or scepticism in assessing the evidence of each spouse.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[66]", "In sum, Allegations 1 (Mitten Incident) and 2 (Office Incident) were not appealed. The Commissioner allowed the appeal on Allegation 3 (Disobeying a Lawful Order). Allegation 4 (Car Wash Incident) and Allegation 5 (Gun Incident) and Allegation 6 (Vacation Incident) were sustained, but only on the sole evidence of Cst. Elhatton.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[67]", "The net effect of this is that Allegations 4, 5 and 6 were sustained on the testimony of a single witness; the applicant's ex-spouse. Her testimony was essential to the findings. In the circumstances of conflicting testimony between estranged spouses, in the absence of independent corroborative evidence, it was unreasonable to conclude that Cst. Elhatton's credibility would be unaffected by the new evidence. Cst. Elhatton was not cross-examined on the alleged perjury. There is no basis upon which the conclusion that her credibility would be unaffected could be reasonably predicated, and to do so amounted to unsubstantiated speculation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[68]", "This rendered the decision unreasonable according to the standard of", "Dunsmuir", ". There is no clear, intelligible line of reasoning which supports the conclusion that Cst. Elhatton's credibility would not be affected by cross-examination and that this would not have a material impact on the assessment of the merits of Allegations 4, 5 and 6.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[69]", "The decision cannot be deemed reasonable by reference to the credibility findings in respect of Allegation 1 (Mitten Incident). The ERC summarized the evidence in respect this allegation:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The Board found the testimony of Cst. X and her fiancé to be credible because they confirmed each other's testimony harmoniously and without hesitation, and because Cst. P. corroborated their evidence by testifying that they had related the incident to others shortly after it happened. In addition, the Board found that the fiancé's credibility was enhanced because he had apologized immediately when he previously played a prank on Cst. P's husband.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[70]", "This is, in my view, a precarious foundation from which it can be extrapolated that Cst. Elhatton's credibility would have been unaffected. Given the shaky platform on which the determination of credibility rests, the decision of the Commissioner that the critical witness' credibility would be unaffected is, all the more, unsustainable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[71]", "Before concluding, it should be noted that the question whether Cst. Elhatton in fact gave perjured testimony remains unproven. The applicant was denied a chance to establish that point. The fact that no criminal charges were laid is not determinative. The dual prosecutorial test of a reasonable prospect of conviction and it being in the public interest to prosecute have no bearing on whether the credibility of Cst. Elhatton, when confronted with the contradictory evidence, remained intact.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[72]", "Secondly, the Commissioner received as fresh evidence a \"joint affidavit\", signed by Cst. Elhatton and her fiancé. Joint affidavits are unknown to our legal system. There are many good reasons for this; they inherently reflect a collusion between two separate and distinct witnesses and interfere with the truth-seeking function of cross-examination. In respect of this particular affidavit, the affiant deposes that it was based on personal knowledge when it is manifestly not; rather it is replete with egregious hearsay.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[73]", "The evidence in the joint affidavit was relied on to explain the outcome of the perjury investigation, and to support the conclusion that the credibility of Cst. Elhatton would be unaffected. While the Commissioner is not bound by strict rules of evidence, reliance on the joint affidavit to conclude that her credibility would be unaffected falls short of the", "Dunsmuir", "standard of cogency. It does not follow that because no charges were laid her credibility in respect of her testimony before the Board would be unaffected.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[74]", "The Commissioner, may, in the exercise of the powers available to him under subsection 45.16(2) and paragraph 45.16(3)(b) of the Act, remit Allegations 4, 5 and 6 to a newly constituted Board. The Commissioner may also reconsider and vary his decision in respect of sanctions on the basis that Allegations 3, 4, 5 and 6 have not been established.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "JUDGMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[75]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "the application for judicial review is granted.

He claimed refugee protection in 2004 on the grounds that as a Muslim apostate, he was at risk of persecution in his country of nationality. The Immigration and Refugee Board (the \"Board\") found that the Applicant had failed to establish that there was a serious possibility that he would experience the serious harm of persecution if returned to Egypt. The Board made no negative credibility findings.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "The Applicant submitted a PRRA application on or about November 8, 2006.

Caden, an immigration consultant with Immigration Partners International.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "In the decision dated March 16, 2009, the PRRA Officer noted that the Applicant had identified the same risks in his PRRA application that had been considered by the Board upon the hearing of his refugee claim and further, that insufficient evidence had been submitted to \"persuade me to come to a conclusion different than that of the RPD\". The Officer noted that country conditions in Egypt had not deteriorated significantly since the RPD decision and referred to U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2004 and 2007.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The Applicant now challenges the Officer's decision on the grounds that his Counsel upon the PRRA application failed to adequately and professionally make submissions on his behalf and that the professional incompetence in that regard gave rise to a breach of natural justice that merits judicial intervention.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "The appropriate standard of review when an alleged breach of natural justice is in issue is that of correctness; see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Denault reviewed the jurisprudence relative to incompetent counsel in the immigration context. Following his review of the jurisprudence, Justice Denault set out a summary of relevant principles at paras. 11 and 12 as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "11 While each of the foregoing cases involve a different type of misconduct on the part of counsel, it seems clear that the incompetence of counsel in the context of a refugee hearing provides grounds for review of the tribunal's decision on the basis of a breach of natural justice. The criteria for reviewing such a decision are not as clear, but it is possible to derive a number of principles from these cases. In a situation where through no fault of the applicant the effect of counsel's misconduct is to completely deny the applicant the opportunity of a hearing, a reviewable breach of fundamental justice has occurred (Mathon).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "a. In other circumstances where a hearing does occur, the decision can only be reviewed in \"extraordinary circumstances\", where there is sufficient evidence to establish the \"exact dimensions of the problem\" and where the review is based on a \"precise factual foundation.\" These latter limitations are necessary, in my opinion, to heed the concerns expressed by Justices MacGuigan and Rothstein that general dissatisfaction with the quality of representation freely chosen by the applicant should not provide grounds for judicial review of a negative decision. However, where the incompetence or negligence of the applicant's representative is sufficiently specific and clearly supported by the evidence such negligence or incompetence is inherently prejudicial to the applicant and will warrant overturning the decision, notwithstanding the lack of bad faith or absence of a failure to do anything on the part of the tribunal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "It is clear that in order for an applicant to establish that representation by incompetent counsel gave rise to a breach of natural justice, he must first adduce sufficient evidence to identify the problem and the scope of that problem.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "In the present case, the Applicant produced a complaint form that he had sent to the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants (\"CSIC\"), dated April 15, 2009.

In this case, there was ample opportunity to do one or the other but neither was done. The failure to do so is inconsistent with the gravity of the allegations made. This is not a question of being solicitous of lawyers' interests at the expense of their clients. It is a question of recognizing that allegations of professional negligence are easily made and, if accepted, generally result in the relief sought being granted. The proof offered in support of such an allegation should be commensurate with the serious nature of the consequences for all concerned.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "The principle stated here is equally applicable to an applicant who is casting doubt on his representation by an immigration consultant who is subject to regulation by the CSIC.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "In the result, this application for judicial review is dismissed.

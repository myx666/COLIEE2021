Moreover, the refusal of the receiving office to correct the application had the effect of refusing to accord an international filing date in relation to Canada, an effect included within the type of decision found to be in error by, and subject to correction by, a designated office under art. 25. The second method would be to construe s. 8 of the", "Act", "and art. 26", "PCT", "so that the benefit of the broader standard for correction of error under s. 8 is made available for an international application, thus interpreting the", "Act", "in a manner consistent with that article, with the result that Canada would be a designated state.

On this ground there is no basis for finding any error in law in the decision of the Commissioner, even if it be considered that his decision was reached for other reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[34]", "If I am wrong in this conclusion and the", "Treaty", "and the", "Act", "are considered applicable to the international Application as submitted by Celltech, then I reach the same conclusion, that the Commissioner did not err in law, after construing the", "PCT", "and s. 8 of the", "Act", ".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[35]", "Without finally determining the matter, I accept for purposes of examining the issues raised by the applicant, that the meaning ascribed by Aldous, J., supra, to \"obvious errors\" under rule 91.1 of the", "PCT Regulations", "is narrower in scope than the meaning of \"clerical errors\" in s. 8 of the", "Patent Act", ". As the latter has been defined by Mr. Justice Mahoney in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 73-74 (T.D.), a \"clerical error\" within s. 8 of one \"that arises in the mechanical process of writing or transcribing\"; its origin is clerical, and it does not depend on its relative obviousness or the gravity or triviality of its consequences. Extrinsic evidence is admissible to establish a clerical error, within s. 8, and the error need not be one obvious from the face of the document. The fact that there may be two bases for rectification of errors, under the", "Treaty", "and under the", "Patent Act", ", at first glance may appear to lend weight to the applicant's claim that art. 26 of the", "Treaty", "should be considered as a means of ensuring that national applications in Canada and international applications originating abroad are treated on the same basis by extending to the latter the benefit of the wider opportunity for correction of error under the", "Patent Act", ". Yet, I point out that this would presumably be the result for an international application in which Canada is a designated country, just as in a national application, if the former were filed with the Canadian Patent Office for entry into the national phase. In other words, the fact that the Celltech Application does not meet requirements of an international application with respect to Canada as a designated state has no significance for the application of Canadian law, including s. 8 of the", "Act", ", for other applications that do meet those requirements. Nor is it a reason, despite the original and continuing intentions of Celltech, to treat the application in the same way as if it did meet those requirements.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[36]", "Counsel for the parties agree on the general principles applicable in interpreting and applying the terms of the", "Treaty", ". These may be expressed in the general principle of statutory construction applicable under Canadian domestic law, that legislation should be interpreted and applied, unless by its clear terms this is impossible, in a manner consistent with international obligations, and further, in accord with the general rule for interpretation of treaties that \"a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". The latter general rule is included in the", "Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties", "(1969, Vienna; in force in Canada 1980; Canada Treaty Series 1980, No. 37).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[37]", "For Celltech it is urged that the primary end of treaty interpretation is to give effect to the intentions of the parties, and not frustrate them. This \"effectiveness principle\" requires courts to read a treaty as a whole to ascertain its purpose and intent and to give effect thereto rather than to rely on a literal interpretation of some articles which might produce results contrary to the aims of the treaty. The respondent urges that in circumstances where the plain meaning of the words of the treaty is clear, where no ambiguity arises, then the general objectives of the treaty are to be interpreted in light of its terms as used and there is no justification for departing from the application of the plain meaning.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[38]", "In my view the general rule for construction of treaties requires appropriate attention to both the terms of the treaty in their context, that is the words as used in the treaty, and its objects and purpose.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 721, at p. 679 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Cattanach of this court said:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Counsel for the appellant submitted that a treaty must be interpreted so as to give effect to the rule of effectiveness and the rule of liberal interpretation. I fail to follow how the rule of effectiveness can mean any more than the obvious duty of the court to give effect to the treaty. That duty is, as I conceive it, to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the contracting states as expressed in the words used by them.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Similarly I find little help in the statement that a treaty shall receive a liberal or extensive construction rather than a strict one. The consensus of all writers is that treaties are to be construed in the most liberal spirit provided that the sense is not wrested from its plain and obvious meaning.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"In my view the duty of the court is to construe a treaty as it would construe any other instrument public or private, that is to ascertain the true intent and meaning of the contracting states collected from the subject matter and from the words employed by them in their context. ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[39]", "It seems to me that art. 25 cannot appropriately be construed as Celltech argues. Article 25 does recognize authority of a designated office to review certain decisions of the receiving office, namely where the latter has refused to accord an international filing date or has declared an international application withdrawn, including the decision that the designation of any given state has been withdrawn. The decision here by the receiving office, not to rectify the international Application by adding a designation for Canada, does not fall within either category. Canada was not designated and the Canadian Patent Office has no authority under art. 25(2)(a) to review the decision of the receiving office and thus no authority from the", "Treaty", "itself to treat the international application as if the refusal, should it find that to be the result of error, had not occurred. I do not accept counsel's submission that the effect of the refusal by the U.K. office to rectify the request, thus refusing an international filing date in relation to Canada, constituted a decision within the terms of art. 25, for the decision here, by the receiving office, related to designation of a state originally omitted, not to refusing to accord an international filing date to the Application. That date was in fact accorded by the U.K. office to the international Application of Celltech.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[40]", "Further, it is my view that art. 26 of the", "Treaty", "cannot be appropriately interpreted as authority for the Canadian Patent Office to resort to s. 8 of the", "Patent Act", "to correct the error here even if that error be determined to be a clerical error. That article speaks to responsibilities of a designated office, that is a national office designated by the applicant in its request to a receiving office that an international application be processed according to the", "Treaty", "PCT", ", art. 2(xiii) and art. 4(1)(ii)). The Canadian Patent Office, which is not a designated office under the", "Treaty", ", could not claim authority under art. 26 to amend or rectify the omission of Canada as a designated state. Moreover, the error in this case could not be said, in the terms of art. 26, to be one that is the same or comparable to an error capable of being remedied under s. 8 of the", "Patent Act", ", for the failure to designate Canada is comparable, in the case of a national application, to a failure to file the Application. Moreover, I am not persuaded, as the applicant urged, that s. 8 of the", "Patent Act", "should be construed since the coming into force of the", "Patent Cooperation Treaty Regulations", ", in light of art. 26 of the", "PCT", "to permit correction of errors where authority so to do is not itself based in the provisions of the", "Treaty", ", which upon examination, has numerous provisions for correction of particular forms of errors by various offices, and which provides for rectification of obvious errors made in the request by the receiving office (rule 91.1(e),", "PCT", ").  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[41]", "Finally, I am not persuaded that authority for rectifying the Application by the Canadian Patent Office can be based on s. 8 of the", "Patent Act", ". It is true that art. 13(2)(a) of the", "Treaty", "provides that \"the applicant may, at any time transmit a copy of his international application to any designated office\", but I note again that Canada was not designated and the international Application is not before the Canadian office in the manner envisaged by the", "Treaty", ". The applicant's conception of a connection between the receiving office and the Canadian Patent Office may have some merit in a case where Canada is designated in the request filed in the receiving office but it cannot have any significance for situations involving states which are not designated and it cannot be deemed that an international application in which Canada is not designated can be considered \"an instrument of record\" in the Canadian Patent Office within the meaning of those words in s. 8 of the", "Patent Act", ". The", "Treaty", "and the", "Act", "and", "Regulations", "when read together provide no basis for the Commissioner of Patents to consider the Application submitted by Celltech as one formally before the Canadian Patent Office for entry into the national phase under the", "Treaty", ". It was not here argued that Celltech's submission might constitute an appropriate application under the", "Patent Act", ", aside from the", "Treaty", ", and I make no finding on that question. As noted earlier Celltech had already submitted an application under the", "Patent Act", ", before submission of the international Application, but that national application would not provide the advantage of the early priority date that would have been applicable under an international application that designated Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[42]", "This result may appear to the applicant to be based on a literal reading of the", "Treaty", "provisions.

The objectives are to be met through those processes as set out in the words of the", "Treaty", "itself, not by ignoring those words. The result, in my view, does not denigrate from the effectiveness of the", "Treaty", ", indeed it respects the effectiveness by taking into account the processes to be followed under the", "PCT", ", in particular in relation to the rectification of errors or review of decisions made at various stages in the processing of applications under the", "Treaty", ".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"]]}

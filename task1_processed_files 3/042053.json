However, immediately prior to the hearing, defendant Ko, claiming to speak on behalf of himself, Lam and Singga Enterprises, wrote to the Court to request an indefinite adjournment of the hearing for alleged health and injury reasons. Nothing in Ko's request was substantiated, his communication with the Court were inconsistent, and evidence obtained by the Plaintiffs strongly suggested that Ko was not being entirely honest with the Court about his alleged injuries and their impact upon his ability to attend the hearing. In the end, the Court decided that Ko had not provided sufficient explanation or substantiation to warrant an adjournment. In fact, the Court concluded that, on the eve of the hearing, Ko was attempting to thwart the proceedings by seeking an adjournment on grounds that he was not prepared to substantiate."], ["[4]", "At the commencement of the hearing on March 8, 2011, Mr. Tak Chan, a paralegal in Toronto, appeared before the Court and asked for an indefinite adjournment on behalf of M.Mac, Liang and Chan. Once again, nothing was presented to the Court to substantiate anything Mr. Tak Chan said or to explain why, given the history of this dispute and previous directions given to the Altec Defendants by the Court, these particular defendants had waited until the hearing to request an adjournment. As with Ko and Lam, no motion record or materials was filed and there was insufficient evidence before the Court to allow the Court to determine whether anything that was said as part of the request bore any relationship to reality. In the end, there was insufficient information and explanation to warrant an adjournment. All Defendants have been given ample time to file materials and to make themselves available. These defendants have simply ignored Court procedure and directions and have attempted at the last minute to derail the hearing for no reason that they have thought it worthwhile to substantiate.

The evidence reveals that the Singga Defendants and the Altec Defendants are sophisticated operators and the evidence against them took a significant amount of time and resources to gather.

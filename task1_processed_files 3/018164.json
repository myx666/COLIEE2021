Thus, if Ms. Hawthorne's H & C application is unsuccessful, she will almost certainly be removed from Canada. If she were then to apply from outside Canada for a visa to enter as a permanent resident in the independent category, a visa would likely be refused because she lacks the educational qualifications and job skills required to meet the selection criteria. However, if her H & C application succeeds, she will be granted permanent residence status in Canada on satisfying health and security requirements.\""], ["[63]", "However, Justice Evans' comments were made in the context of a particular factual case and cannot simply be transposed in this case.

However, the correspondence between the applicant and the Officer suggests that the applicant's relationship with Mr. Chamas was considered. In a letter addressed to the Officer, dated January 10, 2010, the applicant's lawyer indicated that the inquiries regarding Mr. Chamas were excessive. She said she did \"not understand the emphasis on the \"sponsor\" and suggested to the Officer that her focus should be on the other aspects of the application; that the sponsorship form provided was merely facilitative."], ["[66]", "In any event, it is clear that the Officer did consider the applicant's common law relationship with Mr. Chamas. It was mentioned at a number of points in the Officer's reasons. Specifically, the Officer made reference to Mr. Chamas' precarious tax situation, as well as the mobile nature of his work.

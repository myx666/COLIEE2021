A panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) denied her claim; this Court then denied her leave to seek judicial review. Ms. Ratnarajah also applied for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) and made a request for a humanitarian and compassionate exemption (H&C) from the usual requirement that applicants for permanent residence apply from outside Canada."], ["[3]", "An immigration officer dealt with both the PRRA and the H&C, and dismissed both applications. Ms. Ratnarajah returned to Sri Lanka after making an unsuccessful request for a stay of removal. As she has left Canada, her PRRA application is moot (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Her H&C is not."], ["[4]", "The officer dismissed the H&C because Ms. Ratnarajah had failed to show that she would suffer unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if she were required to apply for permanent residence from Sri Lanka instead of within Canada.

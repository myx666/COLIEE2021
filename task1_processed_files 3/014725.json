It must be emphasized that, as he remained under sentence, the quality of freedom he enjoyed was not the same as that possessed by a person not under sentence. Its limits were demarcated by federal statutes. If the torts of false arrest and imprisonment were committed as alleged, they were committed because his right to remain free thus delineated was interfered with. I do not think that law need expressly provide a remedy for such interference for the claims to be governed by it. These torts, in my view, depend for their existence upon federal law; any provable damages resulting from their commission are recoverable in the Trial Division.

The fact that the defendant Outerbridge was the chief executive officer charged with general supervision over the work and affairs of the National Parole Board is far too fragile a link on which to found jurisdiction against him in his individual capacity. Under the circumstances, I find that the causes of action asserted against the individual defendants are not attributable to any fountainhead source of federal law but rather, if they exist at all, are the emanations of provincial law relating to tortious liability.

As indicated, she supports this submission by citing the case of Stephens' Estate, supra, and makes reference to the statutory provisions alluded to therein, namely, paragraph 3(1)(a) and subsection 4(2) of the Crown Liability Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.

The very point was decided in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Trial Division allowed the Crown's application on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the claims for damages against it.

Thus, the statement of claim is rendered innocuous and ineffective with respect to its capability for sustaining any basis of personal liability on the part of anyone but the Crown. In my view, the allegations pleaded in paragraphs 3, 15, 21 and 22 of the statement of claim raise a reasonably arguable case that the Solicitor General may well be vicariously liable for the actions of Outerbridge as an officer or servant of the Crown. Amended paragraph 4 serves no practical purpose in substantiating the plea of vicarious liability and is therefore disallowed.

The remaining paragraphs of the statement of claim can be renumbered accordingly. Plaintiff's counsel may wish to consider adding a further paragraph by way of pleading the particular sections of the Crown Liability Act relied on and any additional facts deemed requisite for bringing the case within the purview of the statutory provisions. In any event, particulars can always be utilized for narrowing or bringing into clearer focus the issue of vicarious liability.

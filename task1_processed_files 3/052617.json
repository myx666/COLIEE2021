More importantly, the Board reached no conclusion with respect to the inclusion issue. There may well be an intimate relationship between a conclusion of absence of credibility and a conclusion that an applicant is not a refugee, however such a relationship does not absolve a tribunal from stating in clear terms its ultimate conclusion of such an important issue. Such a conclusion should not be inferred from the tribunal's reasons. I therefore conclude that the Board did not make a finding with respect to the inclusion aspect of the applicant's refugee claim.

They are of essentially two types; water-based muds and oil-based muds. The 884 patent relates to an oil-based mud."], ["[14]", "In drilling operations, oil-based muds are used to aid in removal of cuttings made by the drill bit from the borehole to the surface. They also aid in the control of subsurface pressures, in the prevention of hydration of absorbent strata such as shales, clays, salts and gypsums through which the borehole is drilled and more generally provide a protective and stabilizing coating to permeable formations. Traditionally, and to a large extent to this day, calcium chloride or sodium chloride is used in the aqueous phase of an oil-based mud in a solution that produces a water-activity level equivalent to that in the shales through which the borehole is drilled. It is this balancing of water activity levels that prevents hydration of the shales which is a highly desirable result contributing to the protection of the integrity of the drill hole."], ["[15]", "If the drilling mud effectively performs its functions, the cuttings that are produced by the drilling and brought to the surface in the drilling mud are individually of significant size and collectively represent a large volume. One of the challenges faced in a drilling operation is the disposal of the cuttings which, when they arrive at the surface, particularly where an invert or oil-based drilling mud is used, are coated by oil and a significant amount of the salt that is comprised within the drilling mud. The oil is not environmentally friendly. Similarly, where the salt is calcium chloride or sodium chloride, the salt itself is not environmentally friendly."], ["[16]", "One of the means of disposal of cuttings is what is referred to in the industry as \"land farming\". Land farming involves removing the top soil from an area surrounding the drilling operation, spreading the cuttings over that area and subsequently replacing the top soil over the area covered by the cuttings."], ["[17]", "During the 1980s, environmental concerns with the practice of land farming increased. In the same period, Fleming Oil Field Services Ltd., which, through its Reef Mud Division, formulated and supplied drilling muds to the industry, began to use a \"fertilizer\" grade or \"commercial\" grade calcium nitrate, first as a \"tracer\" and later as a flocculent in water muds. The product was obtained from its supplier to the Canadian west and American northwest, Norske Hydro. The product was marketed by Norske Hydro as \"Calcium Nitrate\". In fact, the product was more accurately described as ammonium calcium nitrate decahydrate (5Ca(NO", ".NH", "NO", ".10H", "O)."], ["[18]", "Harold Fleming, a witness at the trial and one of the controlling shareholders of Fleming Oil Field Services Ltd. at the relevant time, attested that he recognized that ACND was capable of contributing to the biodegradation of the oil that coated cuttings and at the same time was a fertilizer capable of contributing to re-vegetation following land farming. He testified that he instructed Richard (Rick) Smith, who was employed by the Reef Mud Division of Fleming Oil Field Services Ltd. from June of 1987 to December of 1992 in roles as laboratory manager and client liaison and products sale manager, to conduct tests to determine whether or not ACND was a viable alternative salt in the formulation of invert emulsion drilling muds. This testimony was not consistent with that of Rick Smith himself. More will be said of this shortly."], ["[19]", "In 1989, Mr. Smith conducted laboratory tests and literature reviews with positive results.

Mr. Harold Fleming, one of the owners of Fleming Oil Field Services Ltd. who was at all relevant times active in the management and operations of the company, testified that the impetus for development of a more environmentally friendly invert emulsion drilling mud than those which employed calcium chloride or sodium chloride was his and that he instructed Rick Smith in the work that he did. [see footnote 3]"], ["[23]", "Rick Smith testified that the initiative was his and that, while at all times in the environment of a relatively small corporate office he kept Harold Fleming informed, the inventive ingenuity, if such there was, was his. [see footnote 4]"], ["[24]", "I prefer the version of events provided by Rick Smith to that provided by Harold Fleming. While Mr. Fleming's testimony was, in general terms, very helpful, it was decidedly lacking in detail. He acknowledged in the course of his testimony that his recollection of dates and of the sequence of events was not good. By contrast, I found the testimony of Rick Smith to be more direct, detailed and precise. On the basis of my preference, the following is a summary of events leading up to the application for the 884 patent."], ["[25]", "In the autumn of 1988, Rick Smith and a representative of a chemical supplier met. In the course of the meeting, Mr. Smith learned that another organization had tested the use of calcium nitrate in an invert mud, with some success and with the approval or support of an environmental authority."], ["[26]", "Further, in the autumn of 1988, Fleming Oil Field Services Ltd. received an inquiry regarding supply of calcium nitrate. Mr. Smith was tasked with finding an economically viable source of adequate quantities of calcium nitrate. He identified Norske Hydro. Based on the information obtained by Mr. Smith, Harold Fleming and his brother James secured a contract with Norske Hydro under which Fleming Oil Field Services Ltd. obtained the right to purchase fertilizer grade calcium nitrate and to repackage it using its own trade name. As earlier indicated in these reasons, the early uses for the calcium nitrate were as a flocculent and a tracer. Mr. Smith set out to identify other possible uses."], ["[27]", "At least partially based on information that he had earlier obtained, Mr. Smith undertook to carry out testing regarding the viability of using the fertilizer grade calcium nitrate, in fact, ACND, as a component of invert emulsion drilling muds. Initial laboratory tests were done using a mineral oil base. The tests showed promise. In the result, Mr. Smith followed up with literature-based research that confirmed the potential. Further consultation in April of 1989 also provided support for the technical and commercial viability of an invert emulsion drilling mud employing calcium nitrate in the water phase."], ["[28]", "Little transpired on the project between the spring of 1989 and the summer and autumn of 1992 except that environmental concerns matured and thus rendered the project more attractive. The field testing at the Morrison Well followed, once again with positive results. According to Mr. Smith's testimony, no testing was done in relation to the presumed environmental advantages in land farming flowing from the use of commercial or fertilizer grade calcium nitrate."], ["[29]", "In December, 1992, Mr. Smith's employment with Fleming Oil Field Services Ltd. ended although Mr. Smith was briefly retained on contract in the early months of 1993 to organize his research and development materials relating to an invert emulsion drilling mud made with commercial grade calcium nitrate. He testified that he was not advised that Fleming Oil Field Services Ltd. or Harold Fleming and his brother contemplated patenting the product."], ["[30]", "In the early months of 1993, Mr. Smith's replacement at Fleming Oil Field Services Ltd. prepared or oversaw the preparation of the application for the 884 patent. On the 4", "th", "of August, 1993, the application was filed naming Harold C. Fleming and his brother James K. Fleming as the inventors.", "OTHER ISSUES IN THE TESTIMONY"], ["[31]", "There was some debate as to whether ACND is \"calcium nitrate\". The witnesses who addressed the issue were, I am satisfied, unanimous in their view that ACND is not a \"reagent grade\" of calcium nitrate that would be used in a laboratory environment as \"calcium nitrate\". That being said, I am satisfied on the testimony before me that ACND is a \"commercial grade\" of calcium nitrate and would be generally known in the trade as such. The product obtained by Fleming Oil Field Services Ltd. from Norske Hydro was marketed by Norske Hydro as \"calcium nitrate\", notwithstanding the fact that it was generally acknowledged by the witnesses before me to be ACND. Harold Fleming in his testimony, clearly identified the product obtained from Norske Hydro, re-bagged and marketed by Fleming Oil Field Services Ltd., as \"Envirofloc, calcium nitrate\". He testified:", "\"The calcium nitrate was the product that we called Envirofloc and it came from Norsk Hydro, a regular bag of fertilizer that we had been using which we called Envirofloc.\" [see footnote 5]", "Later in his testimony, Mr. Fleming stated:", "\"The Envirofloc and the calcium nitrate are one and the same product because that is the product that we bought from Hydro. That was Envirofloc, calcium nitrate.\" [see footnote 6]", "The testimony of other fact witnesses before the Court was generally to the same effect, as was the testimony of certain of the expert witnesses. I am satisfied that, in this action, nothing turns on the fact that ACND is a commercial grade of calcium nitrate and not a pure or reagent grade."], ["[32]", "Some controversy also surrounded the question of whether or not ammonium nitrate remained in the aqueous phase of an invert emulsion drilling mud after mixing. The witness Darrel Nagel testified to \"... a very strong odour of ammonium breaking out\" when fresh invert emulsion drilling mud was pumped into storage tanks at a particular drill site and a \"stronger\" odour when the mud, having gone down the well, returned to the surface [see footnote 7]. By contrast, the general burden of the expert testimony before me was to the effect that the ammonium nitrate comprised within ACND would be instantaneously transformed into an unstable hydrated form of ammonia gas during the mixing of the aqueous phase of the invert emulsion drilling mud. [see footnote 8] I accept the testimony of the defendant's experts in this regard and refuse to be drawn into the speculation regarding the presence of ammonium, or an ammonia smell, in relation to fresh invert emulsion drilling mud at a particular site. Once again, I am satisfied that nothing turns on this aspect of the testimony.", "THE ISSUES"], ["[33]", "Counsel for the plaintiffs asserts that the issues in this action are the following [see footnote 9]:", "\"1.

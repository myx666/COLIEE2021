In response to question 9-B, the Applicant failed to mention his seven-day detention by the EPDP.", "The Applicant explained that the omissions can be attributed to errors by the interpreters who assisted him in his claim. The RPD rejected the Applicant's explanations and found that the Applicant's alleged three-month detention by the SLA was a fabrication.", "ii)", "The Applicant's alleged fear of the SLA:", "In his PIF, in response to questions 9-B and 31, the Applicant stated that he was arrested by the SLA and detained for three months, in June 2010.

The RPD also considered the fact that the Applicant legally left Sri Lanka with his own passport, and that he had neither a criminal record or an outstanding arrest warrant, nor a record of his detention in Sri Lanka, to conclude that the Applicant possessed none of the additional factors linking him to the LTTE which would expose him to treatment giving rise to the need for refugee protection."], ["[15]", "Relying on the evidence, the RPD thus found that the Applicant does not fit the profile of one who would be perceived as a threat by the Sri Lankan government and that he does not face a risk upon return to Sri Lanka as a failed refugee claimant.

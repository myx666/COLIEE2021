These communities are represented by the respondent, the Dehcho First Nations."], ["[6]", "Pursuant to the first four steps of the NWT PAS process, the Edéhzhíe Candidate Protected Area (the Candidate Area) has been protected since June 2002 through successive OICs that have provided interim withdrawals of surface and subsurface right dispositions in the area."], ["[7]", "To implement the fifth step of the NWT PAS process, an Edéhzhíe Working Group comprising, amongst others, representatives of the applicants, Indian and Northern Affairs and the Government of Northwest Territories was established to assess the ecological, cultural and economic values of the area. After completing several ecological and non-renewable resource assessments, the Edéhzhíe Working Group made a joint recommendation that an area covering 57% of the original Candidate Area, referred to as the Edéhzhíe Recommended Boundary Area (the Recommended Area), be established as the permanent protected area. However, agreement was not reached on how subsurface protection would be achieved."], ["[8]", "Based on the Edéhzhíe Working Group's joint recommendation and pursuant to the sixth step of the NWT PAS, the applicant Dehcho Grand Chief Sam Gargan and the Tlicho Government Grand Chief Joe Rabesca submitted a formal request to the respondent, the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, for a designation of the Edéhzhíe National Wildlife Area with a permanent subsurface land withdrawal in the Recommended Area."], ["[9]", "Following receipt of this request, the respondents adopted OIC SI/2010-84, which came into force on October 31, 2010 for a two year period. Under this OIC, the surface rights for the Candidate Area as a whole were withdrawn from disposition. However, the underlying subsurface rights were not withdrawn and were therefore available for disposition. This differed from previous interim OICs over the Candidate Area, all of which had withdrawn both surface and subsurface rights from disposition.

The controversy must be live both when the proceedings are first brought, as well as when the Court is called on to decide the case (see", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[36]", "In this case, there was clearly a controversy when the applicants first brought their judicial review application. This controversy arose from the respondents' early adoption of OIC SI/2010-84, which rendered subsurface rights available for disposition in the Candidate Area prior to the completion of the agreed upon NWT PAS eight step process. Nevertheless, the respondents argue that the repeal of OIC SI/2010-84 by OIC SI/2011-111 has eliminated this controversy and there is thus no live controversy currently before the Court."], ["[37]", "Although OIC SI/2011-111 removes both surface and subsurface rights from disposition, it does so only in a portion of the Candidate Area; namely, in the Recommended Area. Surface and subsurface rights are still available for disposition on the lands contained within the Candidate Area, but outside the Recommended Area boundaries. This is not insignificant, as the Recommended Area only comprises 57%, or just over half, of the territorial lands covered by the Candidate Area."], ["[38]", "Further, although the Edéhzhíe Working Group's recommendation only pertained to the Recommended Area, the last steps of the NWT PAS process remain incomplete. Until the entire eight step NWT PAS process is complete, interim protection to the entire Candidate Area should remain in place. The seventh step of the NWT PAS requires that \"appropriate regional bodies co-sign and announce protected area establishment agreement\". The eighth and final step in the NWT PAS process is to manage, monitor and review the protected area. If surface and subsurface rights on the lands outside the Recommended Area, but within the Candidate Area, are available for disposition during this important review stage, it will be more difficult to incorporate all or portions of these lands at a later stage if the need is identified during the final stage.

As I found in", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, a live controversy can exist where a question arises as to the Minister's lawful exercise of its power (at FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED). In this case, the respondents' action in enacting OIC SI/2010-84 was clearly questionable, particularly in light of the applicants' asserted Aboriginal and treaty rights and title to the Edéhzhíe area, which attracts the honour of the Crown. The fact that the respondents have repealed and replaced OIC SI/2010-84 enforces this finding."], ["[41]", "In addition, this is an important issue to address at this point, as the Edéhzhíe Candidate Area is only one of the first few areas to be protected under the NWT PAS process. The treatment of this area will therefore serve as an important precedent for the future protection of other unique and important ecological areas across the Northwest Territories."], ["[42]", "For these collective reasons, I find that a live controversy does still exist.

Continued adversarial relationship;", "2. Judicial economy; and", "3. Court's role as the adjudicative branch."], ["[44]", "Although all three factors are relevant, Mr. Justice Sopinka acknowledged that \"[t]he presence of one or two of the factors may be overborne by the absence of the third, and vice versa\" (see", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[45]", "With regards to the first criteria, Mr. Justice Sopinka explained that (see", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED):", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED"], ["[46]", "In this case, there are clearly possibilities of collateral consequences. As mentioned above, the new OIC SI/2011-111 does address the disposition of subsurface rights in the Recommended Area, but does not provide interim protection to the lands located outside the Recommended Area boundaries, but within the Candidate Area boundaries. It is thus likely that if this judicial review application is not heard, the applicants will bring a judicial review application of OIC SI/2011-111. In addition, the Edéhzhíe Candidate Area is only one of the first areas to be protected under the NWT PAS process. Thus, the manner in which the different parties treat the NWT PAS process for this area will likely have an important impact on the success or failure of future efforts made within this process. Finally, during the time that OIC SI/2010-84 was in effect, prior to its repeal by OIC SI/2011-111, it is possible that subsurface rights were claimed throughout the entire Candidate Area. These potential collateral consequences provide the necessary adversarial context favouring this Court's exercise of its discretion to hear the applicants' judicial review application."], ["[47]", "Turning to the second criteria, Mr. Justice Sopinka explained in", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED"], ["[48]", "In this case, there are several factors that justify the use of judicial resources to hear the applicants' judicial review application. Again, this is one of the first implementation efforts of the NWT PAS process; a process produced from collective multi-stakeholder efforts and intended for recurring and wide use to protect ecologically sensitive lands across the Territory.

Else, \"[p]ronouncing judgments in the absence of a dispute affecting the rights of the parties may be viewed as intruding into the role of the legislative branch\" (see", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED). As mentioned above, although OIC SI/2011-111 provides a greater level of protection within the Recommended Area, it leaves a large portion of land outside these boundaries unprotected from surface and subsurface claims while the final steps of the NWT PAS process remain incomplete. I therefore do not find that this Court will be intruding into the role of the legislative branch by hearing the applicants' application."], ["[52]", "Further, this issue should be decided at this time, because until it does, the lands outside the Recommended Area, but within the Candidate Area, continue to be available for resource staking and claiming. Such staking or claiming raises the potential concerns from the effects of mining on ecologically sensitive lands that the NWT PAS was intended to address. Such effects, although local in the short-term, raise potential long-term environmental impacts with broad social costs affecting Canadians across the country."], ["[53]", "In summary, even if the applicants' judicial review application is considered moot, I find that this Court should exercise its discretion and hear the application due to the special circumstances that it presents."], ["[54]", "The motion of the respondents is dismissed with costs to the applicants and Tlicho Government.", "ORDER"], ["[55]", "THIS COURT ORDERS that", "the motion of the respondents is dismissed with costs to the applicants and Tlicho Government.", "Motion dismissed.", "Editor: Gary W.

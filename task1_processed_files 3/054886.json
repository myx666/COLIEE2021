Therefore, a visa officer may determine that an applicant requires language ability different from that set forth in the LMO and job offer if relevant to the performance of the job duties.

An application for a temporary work permit comes under a regulatory regime which differs significantly from the above-mentioned classes.

The visa officer was required to make findings based on the evidence before her and there is no evidence in the present case that she exercised her discretion capriciously or unreasonably.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "C. Did the visa officer fail in procedural fairness by not providing the applicant with an opportunity to address her concerns?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "The applicant noted that it is not generally a procedural fairness requirement that work permit applicants be granted an opportunity to respond.

In this case, the Service Canada website does not list any specific language requirements for NOC 7411. The applicant included documentation of his secondary and post-secondary courses in English, which was not referred to by the Officer in the reasons for decision, and he included his IELTS results. He argued that there was nothing to suggest that the Officer assessed the requirement by any objective standard; instead, she decided on her own what level of English was required and that the applicant did not have this level. Accordingly, procedural fairness required that she give him an opportunity to respond.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "The respondent argued that the onus was on the applicant to satisfy the visa officer of all elements of the application. Work permit applicants are not generally granted an opportunity to respond, particularly when there is no evidence of serious consequences, which has been found to be the case when applicants are able to re-apply and there is no proof that doing so will cause them hardship. Mr. Grewal presented no evidence to suggest that being forced to re-apply would cause any serious consequences (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "I find that the visa officer's decisions that first, the applicant's IELTS results equated to Band 4, not Band 5, and second, for this particular job Band 5 was required, did not diverge so far from the predictable as to be procedurally unfair in the absence of a warning letter. It is not obvious what other information the applicant could have provided that would have altered her findings as to the language requirement. In addition, there is no lasting consequence from this refusal, as the applicant can apply again if he wishes.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "D. Did the visa officer err in concluding that the applicant would not leave Canada at the end of his authorized stay without considering the relevant fact that the applicant's immediate family were all in India?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "The applicant argued that the visa officer did not provide sufficiently clear reasons for concluding that Mr. Grewal would not leave Canada.

He submitted that the failure to substantiate her conclusion rendered it unreasonable, being neither transparent nor intelligible.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "The respondent argued that the Officer considered all the relevant information. She assessed his work experience in India, his young age, his being single, his being mobile, and his socio-economic incentive to remain in Canada.

Those gangs and former members of the military are alleged to persecute persons who are perceived to be wealthy and, for that reason, pro-American supporters of the current government. Those gangs are also alleged to persecute females, primarily through rape."], ["[6]", "The Applicants lived in a suburb of Port-au-Prince and commuted to work in that city.

As they were leaving the airport in Port-au-Prince, some unidentified men demanded money from them, intimidated them and insulted them as being \"bourgeois\" and \"pro-American.\" To the Applicants' surprise, they also called the male applicant by name and appeared to know him. Two days later their car was again shot at while they returned home from work. The Applicants reported both of these incidents to the police. However, no action was taken by the police."], ["[10]", "On January 21, 2008, the Applicants were shot at once again as they drove near their home. The Applicants also reported this incident to the police. Notwithstanding that the police confirmed that the Applicants' vehicle had been hit by bullets, the police failed to take any action. As a result, the Applicants moved in with M. Jean Gilles' mother out of fear."], ["[11]", "On February 12, 2008, the Applicants received a phone-call from a neighbour who reported hearing noises emanating from the Applicants' home. Two days later M. Jean Gilles returned to investigate and found that their home had been looted and ransacked.

Jean Gilles' mother, along with her daughters and two grand-children, moved to a rural area of Haiti."], ["[14]", "In his testimony before the Board, M. Jean Gilles stated a number of times that he did not know specifically why he had been targeted. Based on what was said to him as he was leaving the airport in August 2007, he stated that he believed he was targeted because he is perceived to be a relatively wealthy middle-class Haitian who has travelled, specifically to the United States, and is perceived to be \"pro-American,\" and therefore a supporter of the current government. He further testified repeatedly that he believed that the above-mentioned incidents were not random, but rather that his assailants had specifically targeted and waited for him at the airport and the other locations where he was shot at, all of which were near his home."], ["[15]", "M. Jean Gilles testified that the Chimères believe that the U.S. government played a role in the over-throwing and exile of the former president. He further testified that people of his socio-economic group are also subjected to violence at the hands of those who were demilitarized after the first coup of Aristide, in the early 1990s. He alleged that the latter persons seek to destabilize the country as part of a campaign to generate support for the reconstitution of the military."], ["[16]", "Mme Jean Gilles Michel gave little testimony in addition to that of her husband. In short, she claimed to fear being (i) killed by the persons who shot at them and attacked their home; and (ii) raped by those persons or others because she is a woman, a member of the middle class and had travelled to the U.S. She confirmed that she had never been raped or otherwise attacked and that she has no political affiliations.", "II.

There was no reference in that paragraph to the Applicants' testimony regarding their belief that they may have been targeted because of their perceived political opinions, i.e., because they were perceived by their assailants to be pro-American and therefore supporters of the current government."], ["[21]", "At the outset of the next paragraph of its Decision, the Board expressed its conclusion that the Applicants' fears of persecution are based solely on their wealth, as opposed to any of the Convention categories set forth in s. 96. Relying on the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [1993] 2 S. C. R. 689, and on this Court's decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] F.C.J. No. 9, the Board stated that wealth cannot form the basis of any \"social group\" contemplated by s. 96. Applying the framework set forth at para. 70 of Ward, above, the Board concluded:", "First, wealth is not an innate or unchangeable characteristic. Moreover, wealthy persons and persons who are perceived to be wealthy in Haiti are not associated with each other by reasons so fundamental to their dignity that they should not be forced to forsake that association. The Applicants have not furnished any evidence to demonstrate that in Haiti, persons considered to be wealthy are marginalized or subjected to discriminatory treatment. These persons are, however, targeted more frequently by criminal activity. This feared prejudice is criminal in nature. However, being targeted by criminal activity is not sufficient to constitute a \"social group\" within the meaning of s. 96 of the IRPA, because the protection afforded by the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is based on discriminatory considerations, and not on concerns relating to criminality. (Translation.)"], ["[22]", "The Board then turned to Mme Jean Gilles Michel's fear of persecution based on her gender. After noting that Mme Jean Gilles Michel feared being raped upon her return to Haiti and that she had presented an enormous amount of evidence demonstrating widespread criminality and rape in Haiti, the Board quoted four paragraphs from the decisions of each of the Board and this Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] F.C.J. No. 246. In that case, the Board rejected the applicant's gender-based refugee claim on the basis that the evidence demonstrated that both women and men in Haiti are vulnerable to being victims of criminal gangs, that \"everyone is afraid\" of being attacked by the gangs, and that such attacks are not particularly targeted at women or at people who travel to Canada. Based on the evidence that was submitted in that case, this Court found the Board's decision to have been reasonable and therefore merited deference."], ["[23]", "After quoting the above-mentioned passages from  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Board then simply concluded that Mme Jean Gilles Michel had not demonstrated that she would have a well founded fear of persecution based on a social group consisting of \"women\" if she returned to Haiti. The Board did not discuss any of the specific evidence placed before it by Mme Jean Gilles Michel, nor did it specifically address her submission that the Supreme Court of Canada had recognized in Ward, above, at paragraph 70, that a \"social group\" as contemplated by what is now s. 96 of the IRPA can be based on gender."], ["[24]", "The Board then turned to the Applicants' s. 97 claim and stated that it is necessary to distinguish between the generalized risks associated with a prevailing situation in a country and the risk that a person faces by reason of his or her personalized circumstances."], ["[25]", "Relying on this Court's decisions in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] F.C.J. No. 415 and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] F.C.J. No. 9, the Board observed that the risk to which the Applicants feared being exposed if forced to return to Haiti is no different from the risk that the average person must face in that country. The Board noted that according to the written evidence, criminality and kidnapping in particular are at the heart of the situation of insecurity in Haiti, and that the Police have not always managed to achieve a level of competence necessary to maintain security in that country."], ["[26]", "The Board then simply concluded, without discussing the evidence that the Applicants had submitted regarding their personalized risks in Haiti, that the risk they would face if they were required to return to Haiti would not be different from that which is faced by the rest of the Haitian population.

Although the Dunsmuir majority refers with approval to the proposition that an appropriate degree of deference \"requires of the courts 'not submission but a respectful attention to the reasons offered", "or which could be offered", "in support of a decision'\" (para. 48 (emphasis added)), I do not think the reference to reasons which \"could be offered\" (but were not) should be taken as diluting the importance of giving proper reasons for an administrative decision, as stated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 43.

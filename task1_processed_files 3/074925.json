In each instance the Court was required to make a determination as to whether, in the decision under review, \"there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility\", to use the words of section 167 of the Regulations.

She claimed that she had been abused by her common-law spouse and that her spouse's brother, a police officer, had helped her spouse find her when she hid after the beating.

It found that she was not a credible or trustworthy witness with respect to her efforts to seek state protection in Mexico. Further, the Board held that had it found her to be credible, she had nonetheless failed to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. The Federal Court set aside that decision on the basis that the Board imposed too high a standard of proof on Ms. Carrillo regarding the lack of state protection.

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened."], ["[21]", "In PRRA applications, it is the applicant who bears the burden of proof:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."], ["[22]", "The standard of proof in civil matters and in administrative processes is the balance of probabilities. In this PRRA application the Applicant must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be subject to risk of persecution, danger of torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Jamaica. That is proved by presenting evidence to the officer. In this respect the Applicant also has an evidentiary burden. The Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of each of the facts that has to be proved. One of those facts involves her sexual orientation. As will be discussed below, I hold that she did present some evidence of her sexual orientation and thus can be said to have met her evidentiary burden - she presented evidence of each material fact in issue."], ["[23]", "As the Court of Appeal pointed out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> not all evidence is of the same quality. Accordingly, while an applicant may have met the evidentiary burden because evidence of each essential fact has been presented, he may not have met the legal burden because the evidence presented does not prove the facts required on the balance of probabilities. The legal burden of proof is met, in this case, when the Applicant proves to the officer, on the balance of probabilities, that she is lesbian."], ["[24]", "The determination of whether the evidence presented meets the legal burden will depend very much on the weight given to the evidence that has been presented."], ["[25]", "When a PRRA applicant offers evidence, in either oral or documentary form, the officer may engage in two separate assessments of that evidence. First, he may assess whether the evidence is credible. When there is a finding that the evidence is not credible, it is in truth a finding that the source of the evidence is not reliable. Findings of credibility may be made on the basis that previous statements of the witness contradict or are inconsistent with the evidence now being offered (see for example", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), or because the witness failed to tender this important evidence at an earlier opportunity, thus bringing into question whether it is a recent fabrication (see for example", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Documentary evidence may also be found to be unreliable because its author is not credible. Self-serving reports may fall into this category. In either case, the trier of fact may assign little or no weight to the evidence offered based on its reliability, and hold that the legal standard has not been met."], ["[26]", "If the trier of fact finds that the evidence is credible, then an assessment must be made as to the weight that is to be given to it. It is not only evidence that has passed the test of reliability that may be assessed for weight. It is open to the trier of fact, in considering the evidence, to move immediately to an assessment of weight or probative value without considering whether it is credible. Invariably this occurs when the trier of fact is of the view that the answer to the first question is irrelevant because the evidence is to be given little or no weight, even if it is found to be reliable evidence. For example, evidence of third parties who have no means of independently verifying the facts to which they testify is likely to be ascribed little weight, whether it is credible or not."], ["[27]", "Evidence tendered by a witness with a personal interest in the matter may also be examined for its weight before considering its credibility because typically this sort of evidence requires corroboration if it is to have probative value. If there is no corroboration, then it may be unnecessary to assess its credibility as its weight will not meet the legal burden of proving the fact on the balance of probabilities. When the trier of fact assesses the evidence in this manner he or she is not making a determination based on the credibility of the person providing the evidence; rather, the trier of fact is simply saying the evidence that has been tendered does not have sufficient probative value, either on its own or coupled with the other tendered evidence, to establish on the balance of probability, the fact for which it has been tendered. That, in my view, is the assessment the officer made in this case."], ["[28]", "The only evidence presented concerning Ms. Ferguson's sexual orientation was a statement of her former counsel. There was no supporting or corroborative evidence tendered. The officer found that her former counsel's statement was not probative. The Applicant raises two questions: \"Was that, in effect, a finding of credibility?\" and \"Was it a reasonable assessment?\"."], ["[29]", "I take issue with the position of the Respondent in its memorandum of argument that a statement made by counsel can never be evidence and thus, presumably, can never be found to have any probative value. Legal counsel are officers of the Court with well established duties and responsibilities, including the responsibility not to misstate facts or mislead. In my view, statements of fact made by counsel may constitute evidence in informal proceedings such as a PRRA application and they may be given weight. In these instances, counsel is not the witness, it is counsel's client that is the effective witness - counsel is merely making a statement on the client's behalf."], ["[30]", "If the strict rules of evidence were imposed on informal administrative processes, such as the PRRA determination process, their ability to function effectively and promptly would be impaired. While counsel would be well-advised to tender evidence through their client's own mouths, circumstances may exist where this is not possible or is impracticable. As Justice Rouleau observed in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"[p] arliament has seen fit to give administrative tribunals very wide latitude when they are called on to hear and admit evidence so they will not be paralyzed by objections and procedural manoeuvres. This makes it possible to hold a less formal hearing in which all the relevant points may be put to the tribunal for expeditious review\"."], ["[31]", "Accepting that counsel may submit evidence directly to the PRRA officer, the question will always remain, as it does for all tendered evidence, as to the degree of weight to be given to that evidence. As with all evidence tendered by an applicant in an administrative proceeding, the weight to be given to statements will depend very much on the nature of the statement, the materiality of the fact stated to the matters in issue, and the nature of the proceeding itself. A statement from counsel as to the client's sexual orientation is entitled to be given no more and no less weight than if it were made in an unsworn statement by the Applicant herself."], ["[32]", "When, as here, the fact asserted is critical to the PRRA application, it was open to the officer to require more evidence to satisfy the legal burden. Had the statement been affirmed by the Applicant in a sworn affidavit submitted with her application, it would have been deserving of somewhat greater weight than it was given. Had it been supported by other corroborative evidence such as evidence from her lesbian partner(s), public statements, and the like, it would have attracted even more weight."], ["[33]", "The weight the trier of fact gives evidence tendered in a proceeding is not a science. Persons may weigh evidence differently but there is a reasonable range of weight within which the assessment of the evidence's weight should fall. Deference must be given to PRRA officers in their assessment of the probative value of evidence before them. If it falls within the range of reasonableness, it should not be disturbed. In my view the weight given counsel's statement in this matter falls within that range."], ["[34]", "It is also my view that there is nothing in the officer's decision under review which would indicate that any part of it was based on the Applicant's credibility. The officer neither believes nor disbelieves that the Applicant is lesbian - he is unconvinced. He states that there is insufficient objective evidence to establish that she is lesbian. In short, he found that there was some evidence - the statement of counsel - but that it was insufficient to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that Ms. Ferguson was lesbian. In my view, that determination does not bring into question the Applicant's credibility."], ["[35]", "Based on the treatment homosexuals receive in Jamaica, as set out in the officer's decision, it is truly unfortunate if the Applicant is lesbian that she will be returned to Jamaica. However, every applicant for a Pre-removal Risk Assessment, and their counsel, must take responsibility to ensure that all of the relevant evidence is before the officer and, of equal importance, that they present the best evidence in support of the application. Where that is not done, the consequences of a failed application rest with the Applicant and counsel."], ["[36]", "For these reasons, this application is dismissed."], ["[37]", "At the hearing the parties requested an opportunity to consider their positions and, if advised, make submissions on a certified question. Accordingly, within 15 days of the issue of these Reasons, either or both counsel may submit a draft of any question proposed to be certified.

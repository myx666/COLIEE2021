Justice Phelan found that while both section 16 and section 40 have the purpose of ensuring truthfulness, they approach that issue in different ways with significantly different consequences. Section 16 speaks to truthfulness in the sense of accuracy or completeness. It does not address or impose a materiality threshold although relevance is always a requirement. Further, an application can be refused under subsection 11(1) for not meeting the requirements of the Act. On the other hand, subsection 40(1) defines \"misrepresentation\" as a material misrepresentation that induces or could induce an error in the administration of the IRPS. In the case of a subsection 40(1) misrepresentation, the applicant becomes inadmissible and subsection 40(2) extends that status for two years. A breach of section 16 does not cascade into a subsection 40(1) or a section 41 situation or activate a two year bar under subsection 40(2).

In this case there was no claim of arranged employment."], ["[37]", "The evidence provided by the Applicant establishes approximately $50,000 in settlement funds. However, as indicated by the officer, the Applicant does not provide evidence as to the source of those funds. Much of that amount was the result of transfers of large amounts from an undisclosed account. When this was put to the Applicant at the interview her explanation was that the money was from an account held by her husband. When asked why she had not provided the documentary evidence of that account her answer was that it did not hold any real funds. Given that the regular large payments were transferred from that account to a disclosed account the officer reasonably found this explanation not to be credible."], ["[38]", "The absence of an explanation as to the source of the settlement funds also brings into question whether the funds are really available to the Applicant. That is because, for example, funds could conceivably be transferred from an account of a third party to an applicant's account to document, for purposes of his or her application, that the required funds were at hand. The funds could then be returned to the third party once a visa was issued. There is, of course, nothing to suggest that this was the situation in this case. I provide this scenario as an example intended only to underscore why such information is relevant, requested and must be provided by an applicant. Other reasons may include ensuring that the source is not from the proceeds of crime or other illegal source."], ["[39]", "The Applicant submitted that it was unreasonable for the officer to require her to provide evidence of her family bank accounts for the past 24 months and the source of the settlement funds. I do not agree. Section 16 requires applicants to provide all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires. As explained above, the information as to the source of the settlement funds was relevant. As for whether it was reasonably required, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2006] FCJ No 760 (QL), Justice von Finckenstein held that requiring bank records and other documents regarding an applicants' business from decades ago was reasonable as it went to the source of current funds. In my view, it was insufficient, in these circumstances of an undocumented source, for the Applicant to simply submit that her and her spouse's incomes over the years \"support the source of the funds\"."], ["[40]", "As well, although it may be unreasonable in some cases to require from applicants documents that they may not be able to access (see eg", "Lan", ", above at para 15), in this instance it would have been relatively easy for the Applicant to obtain account records from her banks for the prior 24 month period."], ["[41]", "As to the mortgage and student loan debt, the Applicant argues that the debt is not relevant as it does not \"encumber\" the money in the bank account. The mortgage encumbers only the property to which it pertains and the student loan encumbers nothing. In my view, this may, or may not, be the case. Typically a mortgage does encumber the property to which it is connected but if that property is sold and the sale proceeds are insufficient to repay the mortgage then the mortgage holders are usually still personally obligated and liable for the remainder of the debt. Here, although the Applicant eventually admitted to the mortgage debt, there is no documentary evidence to show how much the debt is, what property it encumbers, the fair market value of the property and whether the Applicant is liable for the mortgage debt in the event that the sale of the property was insufficient to repay debt. Similarly, as to the student loan, common sense would suggest that it is financial obligation of the Applicant. However, with no evidence as to the loan or its repayment terms it is impossible to assess what, if any, impact it has on the settlement funds. In the absence of such evidence the officer reasonably concluded that the Applicant had failed to prove that the settlement funds were unencumbered by the debts or other obligations."], ["[42]", "Given that the officer reasonably found that the Applicant was not credible and that the Applicant had not established the source and unencumbered availability of the settlement funds, it is not necessary to review the officer's findings as to the Applicant's employment and other records.

Further, the officer accepted the Applicant's admission that her spouse had not had U.S. status since 2002. This means that the allegedly submitted documents as to his status either do not contradict the officer's findings in that regard or that they were not accurate. In my view the evidence does not support a finding that there was a breach of procedural fairness concerning the documents that the Applicant allegedly provided to the officer at the interview.

Comme le juge Scott l'a expliqué dans le jugement", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , après avoir examiné la jurisprudence sur la question, l'agent peut rejeter, en vertu du paragraphe 11(1), une demande sans avoir à conclure expressément que le demandeur est interdit de territoire, au motif que, comme le demandeur n'a pas donné « un portrait complet » de ses antécédents, l'agent n'est pas en mesure de conclure que le demandeur « n'est pas interdit de territoire ». D'ailleurs, il ressort des notes versées au SMGC par l'agente que c'est effectivement ce qui s'est produit en l'espèce."], ["[34]", "Par conséquent, la question à laquelle il faut répondre est celle de savoir s'il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente de conclure que la demanderesse n'était pas crédible et si ce manque de crédibilité suffisait pour remettre en question la fiabilité de l'ensemble de la preuve présentée par la demanderesse et, par conséquent, pour déterminer si elle n'était pas interdite de territoire et si elle satisfaisait aux exigences de la LIPR. Compte tenu des circonstances factuelles susmentionnées, j'estime que la demanderesse n'a pas fourni de renseignements complets, fidèles et véridiques lorsqu'elle a présenté sa demande de visa de résidente permanente, contrairement à l'article 16 de la LIPR. J'estime aussi que l'agente a examiné les explications avancées par la demanderesse au sujet des contradictions pour ensuite estimer qu'elles n'étaient pas crédibles ou suffisantes pour répondre aux réserves exprimées au sujet de la crédibilité."], ["[35]", "Considérée dans son ensemble, l'évaluation que l'agente a faite de la crédibilité de la demanderesse n'était pas déraisonnable et elle appartenait aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47). L'agente s'est mal exprimée lorsqu'elle a écrit qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que la demanderesse était « interdite de territoire » au sens du paragraphe 11(1). J'infère toutefois de son évaluation de la crédibilité que la demanderesse a manqué à son obligation de franchise et que, pour cette raison, l'agente ne pouvait se prononcer sur la question de savoir si la demanderesse n'était « pas interdite de territoire » ou si elle satisfaisait aux exigences de la LIPR.", "Fonds nécessaires pour réussir son établissement au Canada"], ["[36]", "Le paragraphe 76(1) du RIPR prévoit que pour déterminer si un travailleur qualifié peut réussir son établissement économique au Canada, à titre de membre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral), son cas doit être évalué en fonction de certains critères. Ainsi, le travailleur qualifié doit avoir un emploi réservé au Canada ou disposer « de fonds transférables et disponibles - non grevés de dettes ou d'autres obligations financières - d'un montant égal à la moitié du revenu vital minimum qui lui permettrait de subvenir à ses propres besoins et à ceux des membres de sa famille » [...] Dans le cas qui nous occupe, la demanderesse n'a pas prétendu qu'elle avait un emploi réservé."], ["[37]", "Suivant les éléments de preuve qu'elle a fournis, la demanderesse possède environ 50 000 $ en fonds destinés à son établissement. Toutefois, comme l'agente l'a précisé, la demanderesse n'a pas précisé la provenance de ces fonds dans sa preuve. Une grande partie de ce montant provenait de virements de sommes importantes à partir d'un compte inconnu. Confrontée à ce fait lors de son entrevue, la demanderesse a expliqué que l'argent provenait d'un fonds appartenant à son mari. Interrogée quant à savoir pourquoi elle n'avait pas indiqué l'existence de ce compte dans ses éléments de preuve documentaire, la demanderesse a répondu que ce compte ne contenait pas véritablement de fonds. Compte tenu du fait que d'importants paiements étaient régulièrement virés de ce compte inconnu, l'agente a raisonnablement conclu que cette explication n'était pas crédible."], ["[38]", "L'absence d'explication quant à la provenance des fonds destinés à l'établissement permet également de s'interroger sur la question de savoir si la demanderesse disposait réellement de ces fonds. Cela tient par exemple au fait que l'on pourrait concevoir que les fonds en question pourraient être virés à partir d'un compte appartenant à un tiers au compte de la demanderesse pour démontrer, aux fins de sa demande, que les fonds requis étaient disponibles. Les fonds pourraient ensuite être retournés au tiers en question une fois le visa délivré. Rien ne permet évidemment de penser que tel était le cas en l'espèce. Je propose ce scénario à titre d'exemple dans le seul but de souligner les raisons pour lesquelles ces renseignements sont pertinents, sont réclamés et que la demanderesse doit les fournir. Cette preuve est également nécessaire pour s'assurer que ces fonds ne proviennent pas des produits de la criminalité ou d'autres sources illégales."], ["[39]", "La demanderesse affirme qu'il était déraisonnable de la part de l'agente de l'obliger à soumettre des éléments de preuve portant sur les comptes bancaires de sa famille pour les 24 derniers mois ainsi que sur la provenance des fonds destinés à son établissement. Je ne suis pas de cet avis. L'article 16 oblige les demandeurs à fournir tous les éléments de preuve et documents pertinents requis. Comme je l'ai déjà expliqué, les renseignements concernant la provenance des fonds destinés aux établissements étaient pertinents. Quant à la question de savoir si les documents étaient requis ou non, le juge von Finckenstein a déclaré, dans le jugement", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2006] ACF no 760 (QL), qu'il était raisonnable d'exiger du demandeur qu'il produise des relevés bancaires et d'autres documents concernant son entreprise et remontant à plusieurs décennies étant donné que ces renseignements avaient trait à la provenance des fonds actuels. À mon avis, compte tenu de l'absence de précision quant à la provenance des fonds, la demanderesse ne pouvait se contenter d'affirmer que les revenus qu'elle et son mari avaient gagnés au fil des ans [traduction] « confirment la provenance des fonds »."], ["[40]", "De plus, bien qu'il puisse être déraisonnable dans certains cas d'exiger du demandeur qu'il produise des documents difficilement accessibles (voir, p. ex.,", "Lan", ", précité, au paragraphe 15), dans le cas qui nous occupe, il aurait été relativement facile pour la demanderesse d'obtenir des relevés bancaires de ses banques pour la période de 24 mois en question."], ["[41]", "Au sujet du prêt hypothécaire et de la dette relative au prêt étudiant, la demanderesse affirme que cette dette n'est pas pertinente étant donné qu'elle ne « grève » pas l'argent contenu dans le compte bancaire. L'hypothèque ne grève que l'immeuble auquel il se rapporte et le prêt étudiant ne grève rien. À mon avis, c'est peut-être le cas, mais le contraire aussi est possible. Normalement, une hypothèque grève effectivement l'immeuble auquel elle se rapporte, mais si l'immeuble est vendu et que le produit de la vente est insuffisant pour rembourser le prêt hypothécaire, le débiteur hypothécaire demeure normalement personnellement obligé et demeure responsable du remboursement du reste de la dette. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, bien que la demanderesse ait fini par admettre l'existence de sa dette hypothécaire, il n'y a aucune preuve documentaire démontrant l'ampleur de cette dette, quel immeuble elle grevait, la juste valeur marchande de l'immeuble et la question de savoir si la demanderesse était tenue au remboursement de la dette hypothécaire advenant le cas où le produit de la vente de l'immeuble s'avérerait insuffisant pour rembourser la dette. De même, dans le cas du prêt étudiant, la logique dicterait qu'il s'agit d'une obligation financière de la demanderesse. Toutefois, à défaut de preuve quant au prêt ou à ses modalités de remboursement, il est impossible de savoir les répercussions que ce prêt a pu avoir, le cas échéant, sur les fonds d'établissement. À défaut d'élément de preuve, c'est de façon raisonnable que l'agente a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas démontré que les fonds d'établissement n'étaient pas grevés de dettes ou d'autres obligations financières."], ["[42]", "Compte tenu du fait que l'agente a conclu de façon raisonnable que la demanderesse n'était pas crédible et qu'elle n'avait pas démontré la provenance des fonds destinés à son établissement ou le fait qu'elle disposait de ces fonds et qu'ils n'étaient pas grevés de dettes ou d'autres obligations, il n'est pas nécessaire d'examiner les conclusions tirées par l'agente au sujet des relevés d'emploi ou des autres dossiers de la demanderesse. Cela étant dit, je tiens toutefois à signaler que certaines mais pas la totalité des conclusions de l'agente s'appuyaient effectivement sur le dossier. Par exemple, bien que l'agente ait déclaré qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que la demanderesse et son époux possédaient le degré d'instruction qu'ils prétendaient avoir et qu'ils avaient pu faire des études en ligne étant donné qu'il n'y avait aucun élément de preuve contraire, la demanderesse a effectivement soumis des diplômes et des relevés et l'agente n'a pas contesté leur authenticité."], ["[43]", "Pour la même raison, il n'est pas nécessaire d'examiner les arguments portant sur l'interprétation et l'application qu'il convient de donner à l'alinéa 75(2)", ") et au paragraphe 80(7) du RIPR.", "La demanderesse a-t-elle été privée de son droit à l'équité procédurale?", "Thèse de la demanderesse"], ["[44]", "La demanderesse n'expose pas sa thèse de façon claire en fonction de l'équité procédurale.

La même lettre réclamait également des relevés bancaires pour tous les comptes bancaires. Les lacunes signalées par l'agente se rapportent au fait que les lettres d'emploi ne donnaient pas les détails demandés et que la demanderesse n'avait pas fourni d'éléments de preuve portant sur tous les emplois qu'elle avait exercés ou tous les comptes bancaires.

D'une part, celui-ci est corroboré par les notes qu'elle a retranscrites dans le système CAIPS, lesquelles ne font nulle mention de difficultés de communication avec le demandeur, alors qu'aucun élément ne vient appuyer ou confirmer les allégations du demandeur. En outre, les notes de l'agent ont été retranscrites dans le CAIPS le lendemain de l'entrevue du demandeur, soit le 21 mars 2001, alors que les événements étaient encore frais dans sa mémoire, et l'affidavit du demandeur date pour sa part du 31 août 2001, soit plus de cinq mois après l'entrevue.

Par ailleurs, la demanderesse n'accuse pas l'agente de parti pris et elle n'a pas invoqué d'autres raisons pour lesquelles l'agent aurait rejeté ces éléments de preuve. De plus, l'agente a accepté l'aveu de la demanderesse que son conjoint n'avait plus de statut aux États-Unis depuis 2002. Il s'ensuit que les documents qui auraient été soumis au sujet du statut du conjoint de la demanderesse ne contredisent pas les conclusions tirées par l'agente à cet égard ou que ces documents n'étaient pas exacts. À mon avis, la preuve ne permet pas de conclure qu'un manquement à l'équité procédurale a été commis au sujet des documents que la demanderesse aurait soumis à l'agente lors de l'entrevue.

L'avis de convocation de la demanderesse à son entrevue expliquait ce qu'elle devait apporter et, lors de l'entrevue, l'agente a souligné à la demanderesse en quoi la documentation était insuffisante pour ensuite lui demander des explications. L'agente n'avait pas l'obligation d'en faire plus (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 17;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 58;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (4th) 232)."], ["[52]", "S'agissant du prêt hypothécaire et du prêt étudiant, il est vrai que l'avis de convocation de la demanderesse à son entrevue ne réclamait pas d'éléments de preuve au sujet de ses dettes. Toutefois, les demandeurs ont l'obligation de démontrer qu'ils disposent de fonds non grevés de dettes; c'est donc la loi qui leur impose cette obligation. Ainsi que le juge Mosley l'a dit dans le jugement", "Elisha", ", précité, au paragraphe 12, « [i] l incombait à la demanderesse de présenter une demande accompagnée de tous les documents justificatifs pertinents et de fournir, à l'appui de cette demande, une preuve crédible suffisante » (voir également <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 22 et 26; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 35, 36 et 37). Par conséquent, la demanderesse aurait dû fournir des éléments de preuve confirmant que ses dettes ne grevaient pas les fonds destinés à son établissement et qu'elles n'étaient assorties d'aucune obligation qui pourrait par ailleurs avoir une incidence sur la disponibilité des fonds en question. Le fait que l'agente n'ait pas accordé à la demanderesse la possibilité de répondre davantage à ses préoccupations au sujet de l'insuffisance de la preuve documentaire n'équivaut pas à un manquement à l'équité procédurale.

The English version of subsection 111(1) specifically states \"[a]fter considering the appeal\" before stating the possible outcomes for the RAD. There is no question of owing deference: the determination is confirmed or a new determination is substituted. If there was an error of fact or law, or mixed fact and law, but the RAD cannot confirm or substitute its determination without a new hearing to reassess the evidence before the RPD, the matter is referred back.

The new evidence that did not exist at the time of the hearing before the RPD, or that was not available at that time, is admissible on appeal (subsection 110(4)). In fact, the Act even expands the availability by rendering admissible the evidence that was available but that the person who is the subject of the appeal \"could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection\"."], ["[16] In a situation where documentary evidence is presented on appeal (subsection 110(3)), a hearing may be held if it raises a serious issue with respect to credibility (in addition to the fact that the documentary evidence is central to the decision and would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim: subsection 110(6))", "..."], ["[24] ...

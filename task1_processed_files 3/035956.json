In this case the applicant says in his own affidavit that he was asked if Vietnamese interpretation was acceptable to him. At no place in the record is there an indication by the applicant or his counsel of an objection to Vietnamese or a preference for translation to or from any other language. The applicant's personal information form contains a certification by the interpreter that insofar as the translation of that form and its attachments are concerned, they were translated from English to Vietnamese and that the applicant assured the interpreter that he fully understood the contents of them.

While if it can be demonstrated that counsel slept during a proceeding, a party may not have been given reasonably effective assistance from counsel, I do not think the same conclusion may be drawn from the facts of this case. That the applicant's story was not told or did not come out clearly may have been a fault of counsel or it may have been that the applicant did not properly brief counsel. As I understand the circumstances, counsel was freely chosen by the applicant. If counsel did not adequately represent his client, that is a matter between client and counsel."], ["[17]", "That the personal information form was not completed until the day of the hearing may have been due to a number of factors.

I cannot conclude that the failure to file further evidence on country conditions demonstrates incompetence on the part of counsel."], ["[19]", "While counsel did not object to interpretation between English and Vietnamese, nothing in the material before me suggests that his failure to do so was consistent with incompetency. As I stated earlier, the first time there was any indication of a failure of interpretation arose some five months after the credible basis hearing and decision. Nothing in the record otherwise discloses any difficulty that could be attributed only to the failure of interpretation."], ["[20]", "According to counsel appearing before me, former counsel at the credible basis hearing misstated the applicant's position. However, I cannot determine from the material before me that the basis for former counsel's argument was not rooted in information provided to counsel by the applicant himself or that former counsel's argument was not, although unsuccessful, a determined strategy before the credible basis tribunal."], ["[21]", "It may also be that counsel had little or no familiarity with the refugee process. However, this is not equivalent to incompetency. While it would be desirable that all litigants be represented by counsel who are both knowledgeable and experienced, I am not aware of any jurisprudence to the effect that if a tribunal or court proceeds with one or both parties represented by inexperienced counsel, that this constitutes an error of law."], ["[22]", "Finally, it was submitted that counsel did not advise the applicant of his right to seek judicial review. Even if this is true, I cannot see how it assists the applicant.

But on the question of representation by counsel, I cannot find that the credible basis tribunal committed an error of law in this case. It seems to me that in many cases unsuccessful litigants may wish to blame the result on the inadequacy of counsel. Where there is merit to such a claim, a client may be able to proceed against counsel and secure recovery. However, in my opinion, the failure of counsel, freely chosen by a client, cannot, in any but the most extraordinary case, result in an overturning of a decision on appeal or judicial review."], ["[24]", "The final argument of counsel for the applicant is that the credible basis tribunal did not properly assess whether there was a credible basis to the applicant's refugee claim, but rather proceeded to weigh the evidence as to whether the applicant was indeed a refugee. The tribunal stated at page 18 of the transcript, after reviewing the evidence before it in some detail:", "\"In order to refer your claim to the Refugee Division the Panel must be able to find some evidence that relates to the elements of the Convention Refugee definition. Based on that evidence might the refugee division determine you to be a convention refugee. The panel has found no such evidence and will therefore, not be forwarding your claim to the Refugee Division.\"", "In my opinion, the credible basis tribunal correctly addressed itself to the issue it was to decide. Nothing in the review of the evidence suggests that it found any credible basis upon which to refer the applicant to the Refugee Division. That is a conclusion that the credible basis tribunal is entitled to reach. I find no error in the assessment or decision making process of the credible basis tribunal."], ["[25]", "I would therefore dismiss this application for judicial review."], ["[26]", "At the conclusion of the hearing before me, counsel for the applicant asked that I consider certifying the following questions pursuant to s. 83(1) of the", "Immigration Act", "to enable an appeal to be taken to the Federal Court of Appeal:", "1.

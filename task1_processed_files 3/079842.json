This is not to say that there is no jurisdiction in this Court either inherent or through Rule 5 by analogy to other rules, to dismiss in summary manner a notice of motion which is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success. Such cases must be very exceptional and cannot include cases such as the present where there is simply a debatable issue as to the adequacy of the allegations in the notice of motion."], ["[14]", "Jurisprudence Relating to Mootness", "The Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  stated at page 353:", "The doctrine of mootness is an aspect of a general policy or practice that a court may decline to decide a case which raises merely a hypothetical or abstract question. The general principle applies when the decision of the court will not have the effect of resolving some controversy which affects or may affect the rights of the parties. If the decision of the court will have no practical effect on such rights, the court will decline to decide the case. This essential ingredient must be present not only when the action or proceeding is commenced but at the time when the court is called upon to reach a decision. Accordingly if, subsequent to the initiation of the action or proceeding, events occur which affect the relationship of the parties so that no present live controversy exists which affects the rights of the parties, the case is said to be moot. The general policy or practice is enforced in moot cases unless the court exercises its discretion to depart from its policy or practice. The relevant factors relating to the exercise of the court's discretion are discussed hereinafter.", "The approach in recent cases involves a two-step analysis. First it is necessary to determine whether the required tangible and concrete dispute has disappeared and the issues have become academic. Second, if the response to the first question is affirmative, it is necessary to decide if the court should exercise its discretion to hear the case. The cases do not always make it clear whether the term \"moot\" applies to cases that do not present a concrete controversy or whether the term applies only to such of those cases as the court declines to hear. In the interest of clarity, I consider that a case is moot if it fails to meet the \"live controversy\" test. A court may nonetheless elect to address a moot issue if the circumstances warrant.", "As reviewed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , even if I find that no live controversy remains between the parties, the matter may still be heard and decided if the circumstances warrant."], ["[15]", "Analysis and Decision", "The Minister has urged the Court to look at the relief claimed in the judicial review applications.

In other words, is there a live controversy that affects the rights of the parties? If not, the issue is moot. In order to survive a motion to strike on the grounds of mootness, the Supreme Court of Canada stated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that a live controversy must exist not only when the proceedings are first brought, but when a court is called upon to decide the case."], ["[20]", "In my opinion, there still exists a live controversy that affects the rights of the parties.

That is not the case here as the port was transferred to an entity other than the applicants for judicial review and remains so to this day."], ["[24]", "In conclusion on this first aspect, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the relief sought by the applicants is moot or that the relief, if granted, will have no practical effect."], ["[25]", "In the alternative, if I am in error and the relief sought would have no practical effect or is moot, I would exercise the Court's discretion to hear the matter."], ["[26]", "When determining whether to exercise the Court's discretion to hear the applications even if they are moot, I agree with paragraph 21 of the Minister's written submissions which states:", "In determining whether to exercise its discretion to hear the application, in the absence of a live controversy, the Court should consider the following:", "(a) whether there is still an adversarial context in which the hearing may take place;", "(b) whether it is worthwhile to apply scarce judicial resources to resolve a point that is moot;", "(c) whether there is a danger that by pronouncing a judgment, in absence of a dispute affecting the rights of parties, a court may in fact or in perception be viewed as intruding into the role of the legislative branch of government.", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at pages 358-362  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  certainly still an adversarial context in which the hearing may take place.

The issue of whether the transfer of the port and supporting funds shields the Minister from a review of his decision is of great importance to the parties, particularly the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is further of importance due to the fact that the National Marine Policy has been extended and there are 20 other ports in Newfoundland and Labrador that could be divested. I might also note that the parties have agreed to consolidation of the applications and that the Court has already spent some time on the present applications.

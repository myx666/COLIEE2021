These absences consisted mainly of four entries to the USA on particular dates during the Reference Period but without any declared return dates.

However, there is no further mention of the number of days that would ensue from the filing of Ms Hussein's Residence Questionnaire and the further days of absence. There is also no mention of the number of days Ms Hussein would have been in Canada in total while this is at the crux of the test chosen and used by the Citizenship Judge. As this Court stated in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 1, at para 18:", "At the very least, the reasons for a Citizenship Judge's decision should indicate which residency test was used", "and why that test was or was not met", ": see", "Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J.

I disagree. If anything, it is unclear in the decision if that was the case. Eligible residency days and the number of days during which Ms Hussein was absent from Canada are determinative in the outcome of Ms Hussein's Citizenship application. Indeed, when the only way to understand the Citizenship Judge's reasons regarding those respective numbers is to conduct a", "de novo", "examination of the record, the decision is not likely to meet the requirements for transparency, justification and intelligibility set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 283, at para 47)."], ["[19]", "This leads to the second concern I have with the Citizenship Judge's decision and which is related to Ms Hussein's undeclared absences from Canada. The evidence on record shows that the Citizenship Judge asked Ms Hussein questions in order to understand the visas for the United Kingdom and for Turkey as well as the trips to the USA and that Ms Hussein provides reasonable explanations regarding these issues. According to her affidavit, she explained to the Citizenship Judge that her trips to the USA were day-trips for vacation or doctor's appointments. As for the three month Turkish visa, Ms Hussein explained that it was never used as she was planning to use it to visit her husband but that they decided instead to meet in the United Kingdom, hence the existence of a United Kingdom visa. The non-use of the Turkish visa was confirmed by her passport evidence and her Canadian Travel Document which reveals no immigration stamps, either entry or exit, to Turkey. At no point in his decision does the Citizenship Judge refer to that evidence or make a finding that these undeclared absences reduced the number of days of physical presence in Canada below the required threshold of 1095 days."], ["[20]", "Another concern with the Citizenship Judge's decision is his treatment of the extensive supporting documentary evidence submitted by Ms Hussein which he found to be lacking in consistency. In fact, there is, again, no explanation as to how and why the Citizenship Judge was dissatisfied with that evidence. No analysis of the documentation is provided and no attempt to reconcile the so-called inconsistencies is made, whereas the said documentation covers the entire Reference Period."], ["[21]", "The Citizenship Judge's finding as to the lack of consistency of the supporting documentation submitted by Ms Hussein is nothing more than a bald statement. As this was central to the Citizenship Judge's decision, I am at a loss as to why he came to such conclusion given the record that was before him."], ["[22]", "As for the absence of passport documentation for the first nine months of the Reference Period, Ms Hussein explained that this was due to her status as a refugee claimant. Indeed, her refugee status was conferred to her by way of a positive decision on April 4, 2007 and she applied for a Jordanian passport on July 8, 2007. She could not, however, return to Jordan to get the passport. In addition, she provided her credit card account, showing purchases in Canada during that period. Again, no reference to this evidence is found in the Citizenship Judge's decision."], ["[23]", "As a result, I find the Citizenship Judge's decision to be unreasonable as it was based on an erroneous finding of fact that was made without regard for the material that was before him."], ["[24]", "I also find that this decision is reviewable on the ground that the reasons are not adequate. The principles governing the adequacy of reasons reviewed under the standard of reasonableness require this Court to inquire into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. According to those principles, reasons for decisions are adequate when they are clear, precise and intelligible and when they state why the decision was reached. Adequate reasons show a grasp of the issues raised by the evidence, allow the parties to understand why the decision was made and allow the reviewing court to assess the validity of the decision (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;", "Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 16; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 17 and see also", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 46;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 35-36)."], ["[25]", "Here, the Citizenship Judge failed to provide adequate reasons explaining why and how the supporting documentation submitted by Ms Hussein was insufficient to determine her residency days; and why and how her undeclared absences impacted on the 1095 day threshold of physical presence.

Although the Act does not define the term \"original\", the Supreme Court of Canada considered this issue in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. Noting that the existing case law on the subject was contradictory, the Supreme Court of Canada held that an \"original\" work originates from an author and is not copied from another work, and must be \"the product of an author's exercise of skill and judgment.

A work must therefore be in a fixed material form to attract copyright protection, as indicated, for example, by the definition of \"computer program\". The definition of a literary work in section 2 of the Act also expressly includes computer programs, and a computer program is defined as \"a set of instructions or statements, expressed, fixed, embodied or stored in any manner, that is to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a specific result\".

However, under subsection 13(3), where \"the author of a work was in the employment of some other person under a contract of service or apprenticeship and the work was made in the course of his employment by that person, the person by whom the author was employed shall, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, be the first owner of the copyright\".

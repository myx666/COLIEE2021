Specifically it was argued that the only issues of jurisdiction which the adjudicator is explicitly empowered to deal with are those embodied in s. 242(3.1). Objections based on the other jurisdictional grounds, namely those embodied in s. 240(1), were said to fall within the jurisdiction of the Minister and not that of the adjudicator because they go to the validity of the complaint. The respondents argued that once the Minister accepts a complaint as having been validly filed and appoints an adjudicator, objections based on the propriety of the complaint can no longer be raised."], ["[6]", "I disagree. First, I note that by the opening words of s. 240(1), the grounds embodied in s. 242(3.1) must also be present before a complaint can be said to have been validly filed. More importantly, a validly filed complaint is a condition precedent to the exercise of an adjudicator's jurisdiction under s. 242. As such, it is always open to a party to question the legislative authority of the adjudicator by reference to the propriety of the complaint with respect to which he or she has been appointed. Because the matter goes to jurisdiction, it may be raised at any time, and I can see nothing in the statute which would prevent an adjudicator from declining jurisdiction on the ground that the complaint before him was not validly made. The fact that an adjudicator is explicitly required to consider the grounds embodied in s. 242(3.1) whereas no such obligation exists with respect to the grounds embodied in s. 240(1) is of interest.

L.R.(2d) 67 (F.C.A.), a decision which is more extensively dealt with below, the Court of Appeal considered the grounds reflected in ss. 240(1)(b) and 242(3.1)(b) as both coming within the jurisdiction of the adjudicator. While the objection now raised was not before the Court of Appeal, the decision is premised on the proposition that an adjudicator may not hear a complaint unless it has been validly filed, and specifically contemplates that in assessing the validity of a complaint, the adjudicator may inquire into the existence or absence of the grounds embodied in s. 240(1) as well as those embodied in s. 242(3.1)."], ["[8]", "As the filing of a valid complaint is at the root of the adjudicator's jurisdiction, and as the conditions embodied in both ss. 240(1) and 242(3.1) must be present before an adjudicator can be satisfied that a complaint is properly before him, I must conclude that both inquiries were open to the adjudicator in ascertaining the existence of his jurisdiction.

In addition, adjudicators are given fewer powers under the", "Canada Labour Code", "than are arbitrators or members of the CLRB [see footnote 10].

The interrelationship of s. 240(1) with s. 242(3.1), as expressed by the words \"subject to subs. ... 242(3.1)\" in s. 240(1) invited the court to consider them as both limiting the adjudicator's jurisdiction.

An established practice of recalling the complainant provided his performance was satisfactory in the previous season, or of filling out the complainant's record of employment to show a lay-off due to \"shortage of work\" and an \"unknown\" date of recall have been held to be indicia of this relationship.

I believe that deference is owed to the adjudicator insofar as this particular conclusion is concerned as it falls within his particular area of expertise. A long established pattern of seasonal employment can give rise to a right of recall, and I believe that on the facts which were before him, it was reasonably open to the adjudicator to conclude as he did.

In", "Pioneer Grain", "the Court of Appeal was not dealing with seasonal employment. Mr. Kraus held what is commonly understood as a permanent job subject to a temporary lay-off for a brief period each year. That is the context in which the Federal Court of Appeal failed to be \"persuaded\" that the employment did not continue during the brief lay-off or that the employment could not be regarded as \"continuous\" within the meaning of the legislation despite the brief lay-off. On a fair reading, this decision stands for the limited proposition that a brief stoppage of work each year in the context of an otherwise ongoing and continuous employment does not necessarily bring that employment to an end. Or, to put the matter more simply, the continuity of an ongoing employment may be unaffected by a yearly lay-off of a \"de minimus\" duration."], ["[45]", "From this proposition, adjudicators gradually came to hold that the fundamental feature of employment, namely the performance of work for salary or wages, was not contemplated or required by the words \"twelve consecutive months of continuous employment\" in s. 240(1) and hence needs not be present. So long as a lingering right of recall stemming from a long established pattern of temporary employment exists, the employment in question can be said to have continued. In the end, seasonal employment limited to a three month period in any given year came to be considered as employment which could meet the \"twelve consecutive months of continuous employment\" test."], ["[46]", "In my view, this result offends the wording of s. 240(1) and arises from a misapprehension of the ratio of the Court of Appeal in", "Pioneer Grain", ". There is nothing in the language of s. 240(1) which suggests that the essential feature of \"employment\", namely the performance of work for a salary or wages, can be ignored in assessing its existence. Indeed, the use of the words \"consecutive\" and \"continuous\" strongly suggests that it is employment characterized by the ongoing performance of work that is meant to be measured by the provision, and not a lingering right of recall stemming from a pattern of prior employment. One who has a right to being recalled at some future point in time is not in the state of employment while awaiting the recall, and such a person is certainly not experiencing \"consecutive months of continuous employment\" during that period. A very clear expression of intent would be required to give to the word \"employment\" a meaning which excludes therefrom its fundamental constitutive feature."], ["[47]", "The purposive interpretation adopted by the adjudicator is based on the continued existence of a right stemming from a pattern of prior employment rather than on the continued existence of the employment itself. As such it offends the wording of s. 240(1). In my view, the adjudicator erred when he assumed the jurisdiction to hear the three complaints on that basis."], ["[48]", "Before concluding his argument, counsel for the respondents also brought to my attention s. 29 of the", "Canada Labour Standards Regulations", "[see footnote 28]. It provides:", "\"s. 29 For the purposes of Division IV, VII, VIII, X, XI, XIII and XIV of the Act, the absence of an employee from employment shall be deemed not to have interrupted continuity of employment where", "(a) the employee is absent from employment as a result of a lay-off that is not a termination under these Regulations; or", "(b) the employer permits or condones the employee's absence from employment.\""], ["[49]", "This regulation became effective September 2, 1991, that is after the period relevant to the present matter. Nevertheless, counsel for the respondents points out that the", "Regulations", "do not contain a provision defining a seasonal lay-off as a termination of employment. He therefore asserts that s. 29 of the", "Regulations", "is evocative of a clear legislative intent that a seasonal lay-off should not be considered as interrupting the continuity of employment. He adds that by virtue of s. 44 of the", "Interpretation Act", ", R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, it is open to me to take guidance from this newly enacted provision inasmuch as this may be done consistently with the legislation as it stood at the relevant time."], ["[50]", "This argument is of no assistance to the respondents, and indeed reinforces the conclusion which I have reached. If a deeming provision was considered necessary to provide that absence from employment by reason of a lay-off does not interrupt the continuity of an employment, it must be because such an absence does in fact interrupt the continuity of employment. If anything, s. 29 of the", "Regulations", "strongly suggests that, during the relevant period, a lay-off did interrupt the continuity of employment."], ["[51]", "For the foregoing reasons, I therefore conclude that the adjudicator erred in holding that the respondents \"... had completed twelve consecutive months of continuous employment ...\" within the meaning of s. 240(1), and hence lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaints in issue. An order setting aside the decision of the adjudicator with respect to each of the complainants is accordingly issued.", "Application allowed.", "Editor: Steven C. McMinniman/gs", "Footnotes", "1.

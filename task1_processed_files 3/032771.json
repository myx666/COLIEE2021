The dictionary goes on to say \"at first applied to the narrow valleys of the mountainous districts in Scotland and Ireland, but now extended to similar places in other countries\". \"Glen\" is not and for a long time has not been a foreign word.

Glenora has also filed new evidence in reply."], ["[16]", "Consequently, the standard of review is correctness. I have come to the conclusion that if the Registrar had before him the record that is before me, he would have allowed the opposition of the Scotch Whisky Association. There is no evidence in the record that before the year 2000, the year in which Glenora applied for its trademark, there was ever a whisky sold in Canada which had \"Glen\" as part of its name that wasn't a scotch whisky. Indeed, Scottish \"Glens\" have been sold in Canada since at least 1888, as Glenlivet's trademark of that year was based on prior use. In 2000, there were some 22 \"Glen\" whiskies sold in Canada, each and every one of them scotch, and all but one, Glengarry which had minimum sales, single malts. I am, therefore, satisfied that Glen Breton is not registrable under section 12(1) (e) of the", "Act", "because its adoption is prohibited by section 10 as no person shall adopt a mark as a trademark if it has by \"ordinary and bona fide commercial usage become recognized in Canada as designating the -- place of origin -- of any wares -- of the same general class\"."], ["[17]", "On the other hand I am not satisfied that the proposed trademark was deceptively misdescriptive of the place of origin of the whisky and of its character or quality."], ["[18]", "The record shows that in 2000 some 896,607 cases of Scotch whisky were imported into Canada. This works out to some ten million six hundred twenty five thousand three hundred and seventy-six (10,625,376) 75cl bottles. The malt whisky portion thereof came to 132,000 cases, i.e. some 1,584,000 bottles, representing approximately 15% of Scotch whisky sales."], ["[19]", "The \"Glen\" single malts came to 933,000 bottles or close to 59% of the single malts. The year 2000 was a year more or less like other years. Had the Registrar had that data before him, he could not have ascribed a limited reputation for the \"glen\" marks used in association with Scotch whisky in Canada, or come to the conclusion that only a few individuals would be familiar with \"Glen\" - prefixed marks for Scotch single malts. Indeed, one cannot assume that low sales mean little public recognition, i.e. Rolls Royce."], ["[20]", "Glenora submitted that \"Glen\" either as a prefix or as a stand alone word was not exclusively associated with the sale of scotch whisky in Canada. Apparently, there was a malt whisky produced in the 1980s in British Columbia under the name \"Glenogopogo\". However, there is no evidence that it was ever sold in Canada or that it was the subject of a trademark application. At best, it was sold for a few years in Japan. There has also been a \"Glenmore\" gin sold in Canada. However, the Association is indifferent to \"Glen\" being associated with spirits other than whisky."], ["[21]", "There was also an American distillery \"Glenmore\" which has been merged out of existence. It sold \"Glenmore\" Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey in the United States and \"Kentucky Tavern\" bourbon in Canada. The last recorded Canadian sales were in 1985. According to Glenora, Canadians would associate the name \"Glen\" with bourbon whiskey, not only because of the name of the distillery, but also because of a series of quite catching advertisements published in Life magazine. Ads from 1939 through to 1950 were exhibited."], ["[22]", "I give no weight whatsoever to the Glenmore whiskey argument.

Many put Glen Breton in with the single malt scotches. The ultimate consumer who thought he or she was ordering a new Scottish single malt would never know that something else was served.

Certainly, the average Canadian consumer would not be purchasing a bottle of scotch directly from a distillery in Scotland.

I would without hesitation describe him as a 'trade customer', that is a person who obtains a product not for his own use but with a view to passing it on to a third person in the course of his business. There is little need to dwell at length on the case of such merchant intermediaries, who are n fact part of the manufacturer's or producer's clientele. There may at times be some question whether the passing-off action really affects them as customers. The closer they are, that is the more direct contact they have with the manufacturer or producer, the less likely they are to be misled.

The Association is of the view that Glenora cannot use any word which might evoke Scotland. Glenora counters that the heritage of Nova Scotia, particularly Cape Breton cannot be escaped.

I have found in favour of the Association not because of the argument that \"glen\" is Scottish in origin, but because it has long been in actual use in Canada by distillers of Scotch whisky to the exclusion of all others. Had the Irish, who can also lay claim to the word, marketed \"glens\" in Canada the situation may well have been different. The Association referred to an Irish case in which an interlocutory injunction had been issued against an Irish distiller from using the word \"glen\" in association with its whiskey. I place no reliance, however, on that case or on cases from other jurisdictions, as there was no evidence that the underlying statute was the same as ours."], ["[29]", "To put matters into perspective, Scotland's greatest export to this country was its people, not its whisky.

It is the association in the mind of consumers, and not the origin of the word, which is relevant."], ["[31]", "For these reasons, an order shall issue allowing the appeal and directing the Registrar to refuse Glenora's application to register Glen Breton.

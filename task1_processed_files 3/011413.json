Indeed, as was noted above, many applications for leave will be brought by pension claimants, many of whom will not be represented by counsel: see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , previously cited, at paragraph 17. These individuals will usually have no understanding of the requirement to provide full and frank disclosure on an ex parte application, and will likely simply advocate for their own position.

The Minister had a representative present at the hearing before the Review Tribunal, and was thus aware that the record included someone else's medical records. The summary document cited above suggests that Ms. Layden had not complied with medical advice purportedly received from a doctor she had never seen, and further suggests that if she were to comply with this advice, her functional capacity might be improved. In the circumstances, the duty to fairly state the case on an ex parte application obligated the Minister to make it clear in the Application for Leave and Notice of Appeal that this document should be disregarded."], ["[43]", "Additional concerns relate to the statement appearing at paragraph 32 of the Application for Leave and Notice of Appeal that:", "\"[I]n his report dated April 25, 2005, Dr. Benoit recommended that [Ms. Layden] attend a pain management clinic.

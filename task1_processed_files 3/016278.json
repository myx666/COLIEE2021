The same officer on the following day refused the Applicant's application for permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds pursuant to section 25 of the IRPA (IMM-6125-12).

His father, as an Algerian Sephardic Jew, was neither a French nor an Algerian citizen until 1944, when a legislative change admitted him to French citizenship. With a subsequent change of government, his citizenship was revoked. The Applicant therefore believes that he is stateless, a citizen of neither France nor Algeria.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "He reports that at age 10 he developed obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and was harassed by villagers for his odd behaviour. At age 12 or 13, he began to experiment with his sexuality. It became known that he was homosexual and he claims, as a result, he was beaten and harassed. On one occasion he was called a \"fag\" and had hot coffee thrown on him, on another he was beaten and had his nose broken, and, on another he required hospital treatment to extract broken glass from his foot because he had been forced to use his foot to break a glass door to escape from a mob.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "When he was 18 years old he applied for a national identification card but was denied because he refused to declare that he was Muslim. He was detained for four months and tortured with a form of waterboarding. He later developed post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "By 1992 persecution of Jews in Algeria and the violence of the Islamic military had increased to dangerous levels. The Applicant considered fleeing but did not want to abandon his mother.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The Applicant reports that on March 25, 1997, his mother was given permission to travel to visit his father's grave in Algiers. The bus she was travelling on was stopped at a roadblock by terrorists who slaughtered and decapitated many of the passengers. His mother was among the victims.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The Applicant, then aged 31, no longer had a reason to stay in Algeria. He fled and eventually arrived in Canada on June 4, 1999, claiming asylum at Pearson Airport in Toronto.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The Applicant states that he moved into the gay village neighbourhood of Toronto and made friends in the community. He joined the 519 Community Centre and the YMCA, he met men in the YMCA steam room for casual relationships. He subsequently developed haemorrhoids and began to worry about AIDS. By the time of his PRRA and H&C applications, he had been celibate for three years. He suffers from depression, PTSD, OCD and Tourette's Syndrome. His mental illnesses, although treated with medication, tend to isolate him from others and have prevented him from working. He has upgraded his education, mainly taking information technology courses, and has done a great deal of volunteer work with many community organizations over a long period of time.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "In June 1999 the Applicant made a claim seeking refugee status on the basis of religious persecution in Algeria. The Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Division, (the Board) denied the claim in a decision dated March 8, 2000. The Board did not pronounce on his nationality but explained that in cases where nationality could not be clearly established claimants were handled similarly to stateless persons. The Board then assessed his situation based on residence in Algeria. He applied for leave for judicial review of that decision which was denied in January 2001.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The Applicant submits that he did not disclose his sexual orientation and mental health issues in his Personal Information Form (PIF) made in support of his claim for refugee status made in 1999 because he was ashamed. He did disclose this to his lawyer before his refugee claim hearing, an adjournment was sought but denied, with the result that evidence was not submitted concerning discrimination he had suffered based on those grounds.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "From 2000 until 2009 there was no activity pertaining to the Applicant's status. On July 2, 2009, the Applicant applied to be permitted to remain in Canada on H&C grounds and on December 16, 2010, he applied for a PRRA. The basis for the H&C application was unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship and substantive establishment in Canada. The basis of the PRRA request was that there was clear and convincing evidence that the Applicant faces persecution on the basis of his religious and sexual orientation, that his mental health conditions are stigmatized, and, that Algerian state and local communities are ill equipped to provide adequate treatment of and support for mental illness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "Both the PRRA and H&C applications were heard by immigration officer R. Mekhael (the Officer) and were denied on April 26 and 27, 2012, respectively.

For that reason the Board had determined he was not a Convention refugee.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "The Officer stated that the Board's decision did not bind the H&C process. The Officer acknowledged a letter from Mr. Alain Checroune indicating that Ben Chekroun was a \"North African (Algerian) Jewish name\" and documentation describing incidents of discrimination and violence against Algerian Jews submitted by the Applicant in support of the PRRA application. However, the Officer found that there was still not enough objective evidence to rebut the Board's credibility findings and to establish the Applicant's Jewish faith. The Officer was not satisfied that the Applicant was Jewish and therefore concluded, like the Board, that he was not a Convention refugee. Further, the Officer found that the Applicant was not more likely than not to face a danger of torture, or a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment as a result of his Jewish faith and, accordingly, was not a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the Act.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "The Officer then reviewed the new evidence of sexual orientation, noting the Applicant's above described account of homosexual experimentation and activity as contained in his January 6, 2011 affidavit accompanying his PRRA application and a letter attesting to his membership in the 519 Church Street Community Centre. The Officer found that he had not been provided with sufficient personal evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the Applicant's sexual orientation, as a homosexual. Without more corroborative evidence, he could not be determined to be homosexual and personally at risk in Algeria.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "The Officer next considered the Applicant's mental health conditions, his submission that mental health treatment is not widely available in Algeria and that local communities are ill equipped to provide adequate treatment. Based on the new evidence the Officer accepted that the Applicant suffered from depression, OCD, PTSD and Tourette's syndrome, but found that medical care was available in Algeria. The Officer quoted at length from a 2011 UK Home Office Border Agency Country of Origin Information Report, finding that this research did not support a conclusion that medical treatment would not be available to the Applicant, although it might be limited.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "The Officer also reviewed the latest U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices and found that there was insufficient evidence that the Applicant would face a risk of persecution or a risk to life or cruel or unusual treatment or punishment as a result of his mental illness should he return to Algeria. The Officer found that the Applicant's assertions were rebutted by a lack of documentary evidence confirming that such practices occurred.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "The Officer added that the Applicant had claimed to have suffered from mental illness while in Algeria but that he did not provide sufficient objective evidence to found a conclusion that he was subjected to societal discrimination or was homeless as a result. Even if he had been homeless he did not establish that this was caused by his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA nor that, due to his personal circumstances, he is at risk as defined by section 97 of the IRPA.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "The Officer concluded that the Applicant faced no more than a mere possibility of persecution as described in section 96 of the IRPA and was not likely at risk of torture, or likely to face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if returned to Algeria as described in section 97 of the IRPA. Accordingly, the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Decision Under Review - H&C  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "The Officer noted that the Applicant's H&C grounds for requesting an exemption which would allow him to apply for permanent residence from within Canada were his establishment in Canada and the risks he would face if returned to Algeria.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "The Officer reviewed the Applicant's history, in particular his extensive volunteer work with: CANORAA, an African Canadian development organization; the Parkdale Activity Recreation Centre; Auberge Francophone; Food Share; the gardens at Earlscourt Park; the STOP Community Food Centre; the Wychwood Open Door Drop In; and the 519 Centre. The Officer also noted that the Applicant had upgraded his education through various courses with the Toronto District School Board, George Brown College, Seneca College, and Centennial College, all of which was supported by corroborative evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "The Officer noted the Applicant's moderate level of establishment, his lack of supportive connections in Algeria, and that because he had left Algeria fifteen years ago this may cause him some hardship if he were required to return. The Officer found that the Applicant should not have had a reasonable expectation that he would be able to remain in Canada permanently given his immigration history. He had spent the first 31 years of his life in Algeria and had been able to adapt to living in Canada. There was insufficient evidence to indicate that he could not return to his country of habitual residence, Algeria, and re-adapt to it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "The Officer stated that the Applicant's own actions had hindered his removal or departure from Canada and that he must bear some responsibility for his actions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "The Officer stated that careful consideration had been given to the psychologists' and medical evidence but that the medical practitioners were not experts in the Algerian medical and housing systems. The Officer quoted a 2011 UK Home Office Border Agency Country of Origin Information Report as saying that Algeria was setting up public facilities in the five regional capitals to deal with the country's growing number of homeless people. The Officer noted that the Applicant had been able to find housing in Canada and concluded that the evidence did not show that he would be likely to be homeless in Algeria as a result of his mental health.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "The Officer found that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Applicant has been successfully established in Canada to a degree where he would suffer unusual or undeserved or disproportionate hardship should he be required to leave Canada to make an application for permanent residence and that a H&C exemption on that basis was not warranted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "The Officer next turned to the allegation of risk should the Applicant return to Algeria. The Officer noted the March 8, 2000 decision of the Board finding that the Applicant's assertion that he was a Jew was not credible and denying his application for refugee status, as well as the PRRA Decision which the Officer had rendered the day before. While not bound by the PRRA tests or the Board's decision, the Officer found that the Applicant had failed to provide sufficient evidence which rebutted the Board's credibility findings and determination that his claim to be Jewish was not credible. His alleged personal risks due to being Jewish were not corroborated nor did the evidence support his claim that he would suffer risk of harm that would amount to hardship that is unusual and undeserved or disproportionate if he was required to apply for permanent residence in the normal manner.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "The Applicant had also not provided sufficient personal evidence to establish that he was homosexual or sufficient corroborative evidence to establish his homosexuality on the balance of probabilities (the evidence being the same as that submitted in support of his PRRA application) and, as a result, that he faces a risk to his life upon return to Algeria amounting to hardship sufficient to meet the H&C requirements.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "The Officer accepted the diagnoses of complex PTSD, OCD, and Tourette's. However, found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that treatment had not been and would not be available in Algeria. Further, a 2011 UK Home Office Border Agency Country of Origin Information Report Algeria showed that treatment, although limited, was available.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "Counsel had submitted that the mentally ill were actively condemned and persecuted by state authorities in Algeria, but the Officer found that the documentary evidence did not establish this.

To my mind, these findings are conclusions about Mr. Liban's credibility. They were central to his application.

In refusing to accord weight to the applicant's story without corroborating evidence, the PRRA Officer, in effect, concluded that the applicant was not credible. In my view, given these credibility concerns, it was incumbent on the Officer to consider the request for an oral hearing and to provide reasons for refusing to grant the request.

As the Officer accepted that the Applicant was stateless and as his July 19, 2012 affidavit filed in support of his H&C application stated that if he were sent back to Algeria he would not be recognized as a citizen and permitted entry, it was unreasonable for the Officer to find that the Applicant's actions prevented him from traveling to Algeria.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[75]", "The Officer twice stated that in order to demonstrate establishment, the Applicant had to present sufficient evidence that he had a reasonable expectation of being allowed to remain in Canada permanently. This test is found nowhere in the IP-5 manual or the jurisprudence.

As the Officer repeatedly referred to this expectation it raises a reasonable apprehension that the Officer viewed this as a prerequisite or foundational factor to being granted a positive H&C exemption.

The finding was based on documentation about future plans by the Algerian government, rather than real evidence of the current situation. Efforts, plans, and goodwill, in the similar context of provision of state protection, are not enough. The Officer provided no analysis of whether the envisaged facilities to assist homeless individuals with mental illness had actually been set up or of the present situation. Of note is that an almost identical statement about future facilities was made in the previous 2008 UK Home Office report, apparently demonstrating that none of those plans came to fruition from then until 2011. The Officer misunderstood the evidence and, as a result, came to an unreasonable conclusion that the Application would be able to secure housing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[77]", "With respect to the question of whether the Officer ignored or misconstrued evidence of hardship related to the Applicant's claim that he is Jewish, the Applicant essentially repeats his argument made in his PRRA application, in relation to risk, as described above.

The Officer failed to consider the Checroune letter in that context thus failing to analyze the hardship of the Applicant arising from that perception. \"Ben\", meaning \"son of\", is part of a Jewish patronymic, used similarly to \"Bar\" and for girls \"Bat\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[78]", "As to the requirement of corroborating evidence of the Applicant's sexual orientation, the Applicant essentially repeats his argument set out in issue 2, above.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Respondent's Position  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[79]", "The Respondent argues that there is no objective evidence that the Applicant is stateless. He has not provided any conclusive proof of this, such as a document from the Algerian authorities confirming that they do not recognize his citizenship. Also, after the rejection of his refugee claim in 2000, he took no steps to either return to Algeria or regularize his status in Canada.

The letter from the Applicant's physician in Canada did not state the basis for the assertion that the Applicant would probably become homeless and the physician was not an expert in the Algerian medical or housing systems. Accordingly, the Officer's findings on this issue were reasonable. Moreover, the Officer did not have to specifically assess whether the Applicant would be homeless in Algeria, just whether he presented evidence that he would be subject to undue hardship. The documentary evidence on the record was not misconstrued, rather it indicated that mental health facilities are available in Algeria. The Applicant's contention that the operational effectiveness of the mental health facilities is to be assessed runs contrary to the jurisprudence and is not applicable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"]]}

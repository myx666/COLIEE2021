In 2011, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (the Minister) requested a review of the stay, alleging that the Applicant had breached several conditions.

At no time did the Applicant or his counsel attempt to question the Member on his actions, seek an adjournment or bring a motion for the Member to recuse himself. It is incumbent on a person seeking to overturn a decision on this basis to bring forward any alleged unfairness or bias at the first opportunity (see e.g.", "In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED and", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED:", "Failure to raise a timely objection to a perceived breach of natural justice is considered by the jurisprudence of this Court to be an implied waiver of any such breach that might have occurred (", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[16]", "In response, the Applicant argues that his counsel was likely \"intimidated\" by the Member.

Thus, counsel and the Applicant had six days to prepare a response. Indeed, the transcript of the hearing reveals that the Applicant was able to address this evidence when questioned by the Minister's counsel, and that he had in fact reflected on the impugned evidence and discussed it with AR prior to the hearing. It should also be noted that the Applicant appears to have attempted to conceal this evidence on direct examination, as he suggested that the only obstacle preventing him from marrying AR was his need to develop personally. However, in response to a question from the Member, the Applicant conceded that \"the real reason\" he cannot marry AR is that she is married to someone else."], ["[21]", "The acceptance of the November 4 Package into evidence was not a breach of natural justice."], ["[22]", "The Applicant's second argument is that the Member breached the rules of procedural fairness by rushing the hearing.

Given the extent and nature of the Applicant's breaches of the conditions of his stay, the Member's statement was not surprising or unreasonable. Nothing presented in evidence changed the fact that the Applicant had a lengthy criminal history and had seriously breached the conditions of his stay.

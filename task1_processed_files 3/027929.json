In January of 2008, Ms. Howie sponsored the applicants' immigration to Canada as members of the family class. Before the applicants had obtained a decision, they chose to come to Canada. To that end, the applicants sold their house in California and sent their belongings to Ms. Howie's residence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The applicants allege that at the time, they believed it was not a violation of Canadian law to await the results of their application in Canada.

The applicants believe that they were also denied entry because the applicant, Muriel Rosenberry, displayed symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "In June of 2008, the applicants entered Canada at a different border crossing and without proper authorization. They flew to Edmonton where they had purchased a home prior to entering.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "On November 17, 2008, the applicants applied for a visitor status extension. It was not until June 26, 2009, that Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) at Edmonton finally contacted the applicants and requested an interview regarding their request to extend their stay. On July 3, 2009, counsel for the applicants wrote back explaining that he wished to attend the interview to make submissions on behalf of the applicants, but asked that the interview be postponed as he would be away on the day scheduled.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "Meanwhile, given that nothing happened for several months, the applicants examined other options.

The immigration officer denied the applicants' visitor extension and by a letter dated July 14, 2009, the applicants were directed to leave Canada forthwith. In the reasons for the decision, the officer examined the issue of hardship and noted the applicants' and Ms. Howie's admission that even though they had sold their house, the applicants could live with either of their sons in California.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "These reasons became the basis of inadmissibility reports under subsection 44(1) for the applicants. The allegation of inadmissibility was relatively straightforward: the applicants were foreign nationals who were inadmissible pursuant to subsections 41(a) and 29(2) of the", "Act", "in that they had failed to leave Canada at the end of the period authorized for their stay.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "On July 31, 2009, the applicants attended an admissibility hearing with the Minister's delegate. applicants' counsel was also present and at the outset of the hearing, sought an adjournment until the H&C application had been processed.

A delegate of the Minister cannot review a report prepared by an officer from the same department to adjudicate whether or not the person referred to in that report should be removed. The same department is acting in both an executive and judicial capacity thus, violating the constitutional principle of the separation of powers. Therefore, all reports examined under subsection 44(2) must be sent to the Immigration Division. The section 44 proceedings differs from an officer turning someone back at a port of entry because in the former scenario, the visitor had already been granted permission to enter, and is therefore entitled to be treated differently.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Breach of Procedural Fairness  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "The duty of fairness required the Minister's delegate to provide the applicants with an open procedure, with an opportunity to put forward their views and evidence fully and to have these considered by the decision maker. This duty was breached as the Minister's delegate blocked the applicants from making submissions and did not consider the evidence they submitted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "The Minister's delegate objected to the request of the applicants' counsel to make the preliminary application to adjourn the proceedings.

Immigration officers and delegates of the Minister under subsection 44(2) are often simply on a fact finding mission. They are under an obligation to act on facts indicating inadmissibility.

The applicants' prime concern seems to be that the case against the applicants was prepared by an officer from the same department as the Minister's delegate who adjudicated the matter. This, says the applicants, violates the principle of separation of powers. This argument is tantamount to suggesting that all, or at least many, administrative decisions must be made by a member of the judiciary or, at minimum, an independent quasi-judicial body within the administration.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "Clearly, the unwritten constitutional principle of rule of law cannot be put into effect without adequate separation of the executive, legislative and judicial functions and powers by government.

Indeed, Brown and Evans, above, at paragraph 11.3360, have explained why these multi-functional agencies often require such latitude in order to adequately fulfill their roles:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"In the administration of criminal justice, a clear distinction is observed between the investigation and prosecution of a matter by the police and Crown attorneys on the one hand, and the trial of a charge by a judge on the other. Specifically, a judge can have no prior knowledge of about a case as a result of having been involved at some earlier stage of the process. By way of contrast, it is by no means unusual for regulatory administrative agencies to combine the functions of law-makers, law-enforcers and adjudicators.

Immigration officers and delegates of the Minister under subsection 44(2) are simply agents of a multi-functional regulatory agency, the relevant interest of which is to enforce Canadian immigration law, but with no general interest in the outcomes of individual cases. Certainly, there is no pecuniary or proprietary interest. Nor is there any indication that the officer has any say in appointing of the officer who adjudicates the report under subsection 44(2).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "Indeed, the bifurcated process under section 44 enhances procedural safeguards by ensuring that not one but two immigration officers must concur in the result before exclusion action is taken.

They are all citizens of and residents in Nigeria. Another son of Modupe, Kolowole, is a Canadian citizen. He filed a parental sponsorship application to admit his mother Modupe as the principal applicant, and her husband Cladius and son Olakunle as the other applicants, for permanent residence in Canada. That application was refused on the basis that Olakunle was inadmissible on health grounds. That refusal is under appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) and is not at issue here. It is expected that if the Applicant is ultimately successful in this application, including any appeal, that the IAD will continue with that appeal including granting any extensions as may be required.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[2]", "The application was refused at a later time, February 7, 2011, on another ground; namely, that of misrepresentation under section 40(1) of the", "Immigration and Refugee Protection Act", ", SC 2011, c. 27 (IRPA) by Modupe. It is this decision that is the subject of this judicial review. For the reasons that follow, I find that the application is allowed and a question will be certified.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "The basis for the finding of misrepresentation can be simply stated. Modupe filed several documents in support of her application, and that of Cladius and Olakunle. Among them was a document entitled \"Itire/Kate Local Government Registration of Birth, No. 13944\" attesting to the birth of Olakunle on 2nd June, 2011 and that he was the child of Cladius and Modupe. The document bears a stamp and signature of the local Registrar of births. For some unstated reason, the officials at Citizenship and Immigration Canada were not satisfied with this document and required DNA testing. That testing was performed and led to the conclusion that Modupe was the mother of Olakunle, but Cladius was not the father. Without requesting an explanation, it appears that the officer determined that the registration of birth document was fraudulent and that Modupe had made material misrepresentation in her application in stating that Cladius was the father. Therefore, the application of all three was refused; hence, this judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "Modupe, in her affidavit filed with this Court in support of this application, states that she has been married to Cladius for 42 years. About 28 years ago, they were separated briefly, at which time she had intimate relations with another man one single time. She and Cladius reunited, the intimacy was disclosed, and they got on with their lives. Modupe states in her affidavit filed with the Court that she did not know that Cladius was not the biological father of Olakunle. She was not cross-examined nor has the Respondent challenged this evidence in any other way.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The sole issue in this case is whether the Applicant Modupe made a \"misrepresentation\" as contemplated by section 40(1)(a) of the", "Immigration and Refugee Protection Act", "(IRPA), SC 2001, c. 27.

In that case, the Applicant fathered a child out of wedlock, whom he later sought to sponsor to come to Canada. It is important to note that the Applicant in that case was not found to be credible. I repeat a lengthy portion of Justice Harrington's reasons at paragraphs 16 to 22:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "16 Given that the word \"knowingly\" does not appear in Section 40, it follows, the submission goes, that knowledge is not a prerequisite to a finding of misrepresenting or withholding material facts. Undoubtedly, the existence of a child is a material fact.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "17 I do not find this comparison helpful. Section 127 is in the \"General Offences\" section of IRPA. A misrepresentation could lead to imprisonment for a term of up to five years. If the word \"knowingly\" had not been employed, Parliament ran the risk of establishing an absolute liability offence, without the need for mens rea, and might have run afoul of the constitutional prohibition on imprisonment for absolute liability offences (see, e.g.,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  In this case the alleged misrepresentation was a misstatement of fact.

Even if he did not actually know he was Shilpa's father, the circumstances, i.e. his long sexual relationship with Shilpa's mother, while her husband was out of India, should, at the very least, have put him on inquiry. He had a duty of candour which required him to disclose, upon his arrival in Canada in 1993, the strong possibility that he had fathered a child.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "20 In my opinion, the meaning of Section 40(1)(a) of IRPA was clearly explained by Mr. Justice O'Reilly in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where he stated at para. 15:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Under s. 40(1)(a) of IRPA, a person is inadmissible to Canada if he or she \"withholds material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration\" of the Act.

A birth certificate attests to the father being Cladius. The uncontradicted evidence is that Cladius accepted the child and, with Modupe, raised the child as his own. He had no reason to believe otherwise. History is replete with children born to and raised by a married couple, believing it to be their own. Must an applicant seeking entry into Canada disclose every extra-marital relationship conducted at a time where there is any possibility that a child might have been fathered by someone other than the husband? Surely our society has not found itself at that point.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "Here, the husband and wife believed the child to be theirs; a birth certificate attests to that fact.

The motive to find stable formulations clearly exists."], ["[86]", "As Dr. Lee opines, formulations of HCTZ in which povidone and poloxamer were absent had been commercially available prior to June 7, 1995 under the brand name Hydro Diuril. This commercial formulation would have been the starting point for manufacturing HCTZ combination products. Povidone and poloxamer would only have been added as alternate choices of excipients if there had been some problem with the Hydro Diuril formulation."], ["[87]", "Sanofi-Aventis has set up a \"straw man\" as the prior art never taught that povidone and poloxamer should be used with HCTZ. There is nothing inventive in finding a solution to a problem that never existed or where the solution was taught in the prior art (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[88]", "Claim 36 fails as ratiopharm's allegation of obviousness is justified or alternatively it was anticipated.", "D.", "Infringement"], ["[89]", "Given the Court's finding on validity, it may not be strictly necessary to deal with infringement. For completeness, the Court will deal with the issue."], ["[90]", "The basic issue in this aspect of the litigation is whether ratiopharm's excipient in the ratiopharm tablet performs the function of a diluent. If it does, and Sanofi-Aventis asserts it does, the ratiopharm formulation would infringe the '772 Patent. A diluent is essentially a filler which provides bulk to a tablet to make it the desired size."], ["[91]", "Dr. Cartilier's opinion was that ratiopharm's excipient in the ratiopharm tablet was a diluent whereas Dr. Lee reaches the opposite conclusion. As indicated previously, the Court generally prefers Dr. Lee's evidence to that of Dr. Cartillier."], ["[92]", "As Dr. Lee indicates, a skilled person would know that an excipient can perform more than one function yet the patent teaches that an excipient must be assigned to a single category of function. Aside from a diluent (filler), excipients can also be binders which facilitate granulation and a disintegrant which facilitates tablet break-up in the body."], ["[93]", "Dr. Cartilier creates four factors which are to be examined to determine the primary role of an excipient - nature and function, percentage in the formulation, use in the formulation and context. He then largely ignores those factors in his consideration of ratiopharm's excipient, develops a theory of \"progressive use of ratiopharm's excipient as a diluent\" and does no testing of ratiopharm's tablets to determine if ratiopharm's excipient was being used as a diluent."], ["[94]", "Dr. Lee compared what diluents and binders are and what they are to achieve with the function of ratiopharm's excipient in the composition. He examined how ratiopharm's excipient is incorporated in the tablet, how it aids in binding a \"fluffy\" material such as Irbesartan while also providing disintegrant properties (particularly solubility) and how all of this is consistent with the technical literature."], ["[95]", "Diluents are not a necessary ingredient in tablets. Their chief function is to make a tablet larger than it might otherwise be. The evidence is that if the dosage of the active ingredient is large, little or no diluent would be required."], ["[96]", "Despite the wide percentage range of diluent claimed in the patent, in its specifications it indicates that a diluent should be used at the lower weight range. The patent also says that the compositions will contain a minimal mass of excipients. All of this suggests that if there is a sufficient amount of active ingredient, a diluent may not be necessary."], ["[97]", "The ratiopharm tablet of 63.3-64% Irbesartan is relatively large compared to active ingredients in other patents and is larger than the amount of Irbesartan Sanofi-Aventis was able to achieve. In addition to greater amounts of active ingredient, the mass of ratiopharm's tablets is less than that of Sanofi-Aventis (118.25mg v. 150mg; 235.35mg v. 300mg; 468.46mg v. 600mg)."], ["[98]", "In the '772 Patent's examples, the amount of diluent in weight ranged from 19.4% to 35.5%. ratiopharm's use of ratiopharm's excipient at an amount in the mid 20% range would not appear to add bulk to a tablet where one would expect the amount of any diluent to be significantly less in a tablet which is a smaller mass and contains more active ingredient."], ["[99]", "Ratiopharm's excipient is consistently cited for its binding properties - a feature of importance when dealing with fluffy material - and it is extensively used as a disintegrant."], ["[100]", "Dr. Lee's evidence is that it is not unexpected that ratiopharm's excipient level in ratiopharm's tablet would be on the high side of an acceptable range for a binder because ratiopharm's tablet contains more of the fluffy substance Irbesartan than does Sanofi-Aventis' tablet."], ["[101]", "That evidence was supported by several tests that indicate ratiopharm's excipient as a binder and/or disintegrant in the 20% range is acceptable. This is also consistent with the evidence of prior art. Lastly, binder levels of about 25% are acceptable in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients which is in the same range of the total binder (ratiopharm's excipient and the other binder povidone) percentage in ratiopharm's tablet."], ["[102]", "The other evidence relied upon by Sanofi-Aventis, U.S. Patent '068 and European Patent '108 are distinguishable from both the '772 Patent and ratiopharm's proposed formulation and does not undermine the weight of the evidence that ratiopharm's excipient is not used as a diluent."], ["[103]", "Given the necessity of a binder for Irbesartan and the importance of rapid disintegration of this type of drug, it is hard to see how ratiopharm's excipient would have filled the \"primary\" role as a diluent in a tablet that did not require extra bulk. Sanofi-Aventis has been unable, on a balance of probabilities, to establish that ratiopharm's excipient in ratiopharm's tablets fills that primary role as a diluent."], ["[104]", "Therefore, the Court finds that for purposes of a NOC proceeding, ratiopharm's proposed formulation does not infringe the '772 Patent.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[105]", "THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that", "the application for an order prohibiting the Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance to the Respondent, ratiopharm Inc., in connection with its 75mg, 150mg and 300mg Irbesartan tablets for oral administration until after the expiration of Canadian Letters Patent No. 2,057,913 and Canadian Letters Patent No. 2,177,772, is denied with costs to the Respondent, ratiopharm Inc.", "Application dismissed.", "Editor: Angela E.

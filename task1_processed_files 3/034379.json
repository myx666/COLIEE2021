However, he received death threats from members of Al-Qaeda. The applicant did not report this to the police, claiming that they are sometimes corrupt and that the Algerian people have no confidence in the police. The applicant also stated that some police officers work for the terrorists and that therefore he preferred not to go to the police."], ["[5]", "On February 12, 2007, the applicant fled Algeria for France where he arrived by boat. In France, some acquaintances advised him against claiming asylum. Accordingly, the applicant took no steps to do so.

The documentary evidence refers to serious steps the Algerian government has taken to combat the activities of terrorist organizations. Algeria is a democratic country, and there is a presumption that its authorities can provide concrete protection to its citizens. The RPD also found that, although corruption exists in the Algerian police force, it is limited to individuals."], ["[8]", "Thus, the RPD concluded that the applicant's decision not to seek state protection was unjustified in the circumstances and that, as a result, he could not obtain refugee protection. In the RPD's opinion, the documentary evidence did not support the applicant's claim that the police could not protect him. It found that the subjective fear alleged by the applicant could not rebut the presumption of state protection."], ["[9]", "Moreover, the RPD rejected the applicant's explanation about his decision not to seek asylum in France. The RPD found that the applicant's behaviour was inconsistent with his alleged subjective fear of persecution. The fact that his colleagues had advised him against claiming asylum in France was not a satisfactory explanation."], ["[10]", "Last, in its decision, the RPD explained why it did not grant the motion for recusal brought by counsel for the applicant. During the hearing, the applicant's spouse, who was participating as an observer, got up to give a document to counsel for the applicant. The panel found that this behaviour was inappropriate given that an observer cannot behave in this manner during the hearing especially since the panel had required the applicant to testify without any documents. At that point, the panel stated that it would take the observer's behaviour into account when assessing the applicant's credibility.

He submits that the applicant adduced evidence establishing that the Algerian government is not capable of controlling terrorist acts and that the documentary evidence he provided was more recent than the evidence the panel relied on. Accordingly, the RPD did not consider probative evidence showing that protection in Algeria against terrorist acts is now ineffective."], ["[13]", "Third, the applicant submits that the RPD erroneously found that the fact that the applicant had not requested asylum in France showed a lack of subjective fear. The applicant stated that he had intended to take that step in France but that he was told he would sent back to Algeria."], ["[14]", "Fourth, in the applicant's view, the panel erred by refusing to recuse himself when the applicant made that request, alleging that the panel's behaviour gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. According to the applicant, the panel impatiently threw his pen at his computer and laughed and smiled while the applicant was testifying.

Furthermore, counsel for the applicant did not submit an audio transcript of the hearing before the RPD and hence could not establish that the panel laughed while the applicant was testifying. Thus, on the basis of these allegations, the Court cannot find that the panel's behaviour gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias."], ["[23]", "The incident that took place at the hearing did not affect the decision-maker's impartiality. Certainly, the applicant's spouse gave a document to counsel for the applicant, but the applicant did not have access to it at any time. The panel indicated that this incident would negatively affect the applicant's credibility. Consequently, counsel for the applicant thought it appropriate, in these circumstances, to make a motion for recusal."], ["[24]", "The Court is of the opinion that the observer's behaviour was not a reason that could affect the applicant's credibility. It appears that the panel's reaction to the situation was a bit extreme. This incident was certainly regrettable and became too much of an issue in the circumstances. However, a person observing the situation objectively, considering all the evidence and the issues at play, would not see the panel as biased because of this annoying incident. There is nothing to suggest that the panel did not decide the case impartially."], ["[25]", "On this point, it is important to note that the panel's decision to reject the applicant's refugee claim is entirely supported by facts that are unrelated to the incident that occurred during the hearing. In fact, the evidence was that the applicant's behaviour was not consistent with that of a person who really feared for his safety. The reasoned decision, as we will see in the following paragraphs, was based on the facts put into evidence, and the findings are therefore reasonable.", ".

The evidence submitted by the applicant consisted of newspaper articles referring to possible repercussions of movements in Libya on Al-Qaeda's activities in Algeria. Although the Algerian government will certainly have to face new challenges in terms of preventing terrorist acts, the evidence does not demonstrate that the government is no longer able to provide adequate protection to its citizens because the situation has become uncontrollable."], ["[29]", "Thus, the RPD did not fail to consider important evidence in this case (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 17, 1998 CarswellNat 1981).

Although Michael is from Barbados, she met him in St. Vincent in 1998. He was very good to her, took her on trips to Barbados and pampered her. She agreed to marry him. After the marriage, she moved with him to Barbados, leaving her five children with her mother in St. Vincent."], ["[5]", "The abuse began soon after arriving in Barbados. When the applicant told Michael that she was pregnant, he wanted her to have an abortion but she refused. This led to a physical assault by Michael in April 2001, resulting in her being hospitalized for a month.

In March 2002, the applicant returned to St. Vincent with Codie to visit her mother for about a month. However, a few days later Michael followed her there and asked her to return to Barbados. He promised to be better. Although she did not believe him, she returned because she claimed that she had a plan. In May 2002, she stole $5,000.00 from Michael's drug dealings and she and Codie fled to Canada."], ["[8]", "The applicant stated that she is afraid to return to either Barbados or St. Vincent because Michael will find her.

While the documentary evidence indicates that violence against women is a serious problem in St. Vincent, there is also information that shows that the government has taken and is continuing to take measures to deal with the problem. In any event, the claimant did not experience abuse while in St. Vincent. In Barbados, where the abuse occurred, the claimant chose not to seek protection.", "The claimant testified that on one occasion the St. Vincent Immigration authorities denied Michael entry to the island. Given that he is involved in drugs, and the government's concerns and efforts in attempting to deal with drug activity on the island, the panel finds that there is no reason why the claimant could not report Michael to the authorities. This could well result in his being considered a persona non grata and denied any future entry to the island.", "On the other hand, if Michael were to gain entry to St. Vincent and create any problems for the claimant, the panel finds that state protection is available to her, should she need and seek such protection. As per Zalzali, state protection is not perfect. Nevertheless, based on the above-mentioned documentary evidence, the panel finds that the state is making serious efforts to provide protection to women who are the subject of violence or domestic abuse.", "The panel has considered all three protection grounds under sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act and finds that as adequate protection is available to the claimants, there is no serious possibility that the claimants will be harmed in St. Vincent regardless whether the alleged harm would amount to persecution, a risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or torture.", "Issue"], ["[11]", "Did the Board err in law in finding that state protection is available to the applicant?"], ["[12]", "The applicant later included the following issue:", "Did the Board err in law in finding that state protection is available to the applicant, specifically as it relates to the St.Vincent's ability to interdict drug traffickers such as the applicant's husband?", "Applicants' Submissions"], ["[13]", "Standard of Review", "The applicant submitted that in determining whether or not the Board properly applied the test for state protection to the facts of this case, the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness simpliciter."], ["[14]", "Issue 1", "The applicant submitted that in finding that state protection is available to the applicants, the Board erred by ignoring contrary documentation on country conditions.

Just as a court will only defer to an agency's interpretation of its constituent statute if it provides reasons for its conclusion, so a court will be reluctant to defer to an agency's factual determinations in the absence of express findings, and an analysis of the evidence that shows how the agency reached its result.", "On the other hand, the reasons given by administrative agencies are not to be read hypercritically by a court ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  required to refer to every piece of evidence that they received that is contrary to their finding, and to explain how they dealt with it (see, for example,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). That would be far too onerous a burden to impose upon administrative decision-makers who may be struggling with a heavy case-load and inadequate resources. A statement by the agency in its reasons for decision that, in making its findings, it considered all the evidence before it, will often suffice to assure the parties, and a reviewing court, that the agency directed itself to the totality of the evidence when making its findings of fact.", "However, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact \"without regard to the evidence\":  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). In other words, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts. Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact.

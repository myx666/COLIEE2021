In particular, the trade-mark is not registrable because, as set out in s. 12(1)(b), it is clearly descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of the character or quality of the wares in association with which it is used or proposed to be used, or of the persons employed in the production of the wares. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in view of the fact that the applied-for trade-mark includes the term \"engineering\", which is regulated in Canada, it follows that", "i. if members of the profession of engineering in Canada are involved in the production of the wares, the applied-for mark is clearly descriptive of both the character and quality of the wares and of the persons employed in their production;", "ii. if members of the profession of engineering in Canada are not involved in the production of the wares, then the applied-for mark is deceptively misdescriptive of both the character and quality of the wares and of the persons employed in their production.", "...", "(f) The Opponent bases its opposition on the ground set out in s. 38(2)(d), namely that the trade-mark is not distinctive.

However, transposing the comments of Board Member Bradbury in Comsol, supra, at para 21, to the present case, there is no evidence that members of the Canadian public are aware of the Opponent's logic concerning what it considers to be an acceptable or unacceptable use of the word \"engineering\" by parties who are not licensed to practice engineering in Canada."], ["[27]", "The affidavit of Allen filed in this appeal is irrelevant save as to the removal of certain issues."], ["[28]", "The affidavit of Eller filed on this appeal establishes that the present (not the original) Applicant employs many engineers; none of them apparently Canadian, and has a long history of designing and manufacturing brake parts; apparently not in Canada."], ["[29]", "What we don't have is as important as what we do have.

This trade-mark is identified only in a textual form. It would therefore permit Alavida to use the words \"Masterpiece Living\" in any size and with any style of lettering, color or design. As found by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Nothing restricts the appellant from changing the colour of its signs or the style of lettering of \"Mr. Submarine\" or from engaging in a telephone and delivery system such as that followed by the respondent or any other suitable system for the sale of its sandwiches. Were it to make any of these changes its exclusive right to the use of \"Mr. Submarine\" would apply just as it applies to its use in the appellant's business as presently carried on. Whether the respondent's trade marks or trade names are confusing with the appellant's registered trade mark must accordingly be considered not only having regard to the appellant's present business in the area of the respondent's operations but having regard as well to whether confusion would be likely if the appellant were to operate in that area in any way open to it using its trade mark in association with the sandwiches or services sold or provided in the operation. [Emphasis added; pp. 102-3.]"], ["[35]", "Rothstein J proceeded in", "Masterpiece", "to consider the question of confusion, wherein the Court is to put itself in the position of an average person who is likely to be a consumer of the wares or services in question.

He wrote at paragraph 61:", "61 In a case such as this, comparison can be approached by considering only those characteristics that define the relevant trade-marks or trade-name. It is only these elements that will allow consumers to distinguish between the two trade-marks or between the trade-mark and the trade-name. Here, because Alavida's proposed trade-mark is only the words \"Masterpiece Living\", the difference between or similarity with each of Masterpiece Inc.'s trade-marks and trade-name must be assessed only on the basis of these words alone. In my opinion, Alavida's \"Masterpiece Living\" is closest to Masterpiece Inc.'s \"Masterpiece the Art of Living\". I think that comparing this Masterpiece Inc. trade-mark with the Alavida trade-mark is decisive. If Alavida's mark is not likely to cause confusion with this Masterpiece Inc. mark, it is unnecessary to consider the other Masterpiece Inc. marks and trade-name which are less similar to the Alavida trade-mark. Conversely, if Alavida's trade-mark is found to be likely to cause confusion with this Masterpiece Inc. mark, it is unnecessary to test resemblance of its trade-mark with other Masterpiece Inc. trade-marks or its trade-name, although they may be relevant as part of the surrounding circumstances when likely confusion with the \"Masterpiece the Art of Living\" trade-mark is considered."], ["[36]", "While Rothstein J was dealing with the issue of confusion in", "Masterpiece", ", the manner in which other issues such as \"clearly descriptive\" or \"deceptively misdescriptive\" or \"distinctiveness\" are to be approached is to be done in the same manner.

The parties differed on the question whether the offensive part of the trade-mark must be the dominant element of it or merely a dominant feature.

O'Reilly J wrote at paragraphs 19 and 20:", "19 JBCL argues that it is only using the word \"engineering\" in its ordinary sense, referring to the use of skill or art in a particular field of activity. It is not using it in the professional sense. However, given that use of the term \"engineering\" is regulated by law, JBCL's argument is unpersuasive. The situation is different here than in respect of other registered uses of the word \"engineering\" cited by JBCL (e.g. \"document engineering\", \"engineering sunglasses\", and \"body engineering\"). In those cases, there is little chance that consumers would be misled into thinking that professional engineers are associated with the business. While \"spray engineering\" may not be a recognized field of speciality in the engineering profession, those words connote a range of sophisticated technical services related to fluid handling and distribution and, therefore, a connection with the kinds of services one might expect professional engineers to provide.", "20 In my view, the very fact that the term \"engineering\" is closely regulated has implications here. Most people would assume that businesses using that word in their name offer engineering services and employ professional engineers, unless the context clearly indicated otherwise. The Board itself arrived at a similar conclusion when it refused to register JBCL's proposed trade-mark \"Spray Engineering\" on the grounds that the average client of JBCL would assume that engineers were involved in all or most of the business's activities:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."], ["[50]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  question as to whether one was a licensed Canadian engineer was irrelevant. He wrote at paragraphs 57 and 58:", "57 I note that in the case at bar, the impugned term ENGINEERED functions as a verb (past participle) and refers to a process that has been performed on an article (wood). It does not represent the noun \"engineer\" - it is a verb and a past participle of the verb no less. I therefore, am of the view that the claim by the appellant that the proposed mark is deceptively misdescriptive of the persons engaged in the production of the goods and services is without merit. The proposed trade-mark is not THE WOOD ENGINEER'S ASSOCIATION.", "58 It is also my view that none of the arguments raised by the appellant concerning the public's perception of the word \"ENGINEER\" or prohibitions against the use of the term or title \"ENGINEER\", unless one is in fact a registered professional engineer, have any merit given these above circumstances."], ["[51]", "More recently, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice O'Keefe held that the mark KELLY ENGINEERING RESOURCES for personnel employment services was not registrable, in that it implied that the services rendered were those of Canadian licensed engineers. He wrote at paragraphs 149, 153, 156 and 157:", "149 The trade-mark, when considered in association with the listed services, implies that the respondent is entitled to provide engineering employment services to engineers and companies seeking to hire engineers. However, as indicated by the APEGGA Policy and the affidavit of Mr. Neth, human resource and staffing companies that offer services in the manner offered by the respondent require a permit to practice in Alberta. The respondent does not hold any such permit, which suggests that the trade-mark is deceptively misdescriptive of the services provided under that name. This is exacerbated by the evidence that the trade-mark is used to advertise employment of qualified designers, drafters and technicians. As noted by Mr. Neth, only licensed engineers are entitled to practice engineering in Canada and this advertisement misleads consumers into believing that designers, drafters and technicians placed by the respondent are also qualified to practice engineering.", ". . .", "153 For these collective reasons and recalling that the purpose of this portion of paragraph 12(1)(b) is to prevent the purchasing public from being misled, I find that the trade-mark is deceptively misdescriptive of the character and quality of the listed services. It is therefore prohibited pursuant to paragraph 12(1)(b) of the Act.", ". . .", "156 I also note the underlying rationale for the APEGGA Policy as explained by Mr. Neth. This policy is in place to protect customers who are unfamiliar with the practice of professional engineering. I find particularly troublesome the potential that a customer seeking to hire a qualified engineer, as advertised by the respondent, hires an engineer through the respondent's trade-mark that may be qualified in another jurisdiction but not licensed to practice engineering in Canada. This offends the objects specified in several Canadian engineering statutes. For example, subsection 5(c) of the Engineering Profession Act, RSNS 1989, c 148 (included in Mr. Kizas' affidavit) clearly states", "The objects of the Association are to [...] assure the general public of the proficiency and competency of professional engineers in the practice of engineering [...]", "157 I find that the acceptance of the trade-mark application runs the risk of opening up the door to abuse, thereby placing the public interest at risk, the protection of which lies at the core of the regulation of the engineering profession in Canada. This accentuates the importance that a trade-mark used in a field related to engineering not be deceptively misdescriptive or of such a nature as to deceive the public in a manner that ultimately offends the public order. The trade-mark is therefore not saved by subsection 14(1) of the Act."], ["[52]", "On the evidence before me, which is unaffected by the evidence of Eller, I conclude, as did the Hearing Officer, that:", "...the average Canadian is as likely, if not more likely, to react to the mark by thinking that professional engineers are involved in the production of the wares (paragraph 47)", "and", "..the contexts of the use of [ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE] which all appear to relate to either the engineering profession or practice of engineering or to the education and licensing of engineers in", "Canada and abroad", "(emphasis added - paragraph 48)"], ["[53]", "The Hearing Officer did not restrict her findings only to Canadian engineers licensed to practice in one or more of Canada's provinces or territories.

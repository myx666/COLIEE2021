In cases where spouses are compelled to get married in the country of origin, we may ask ourselves whether, without consent from one of the spouses, such a marriage would be recognized in Canada, like bigamous and polygamous marriages, which are not legally recognized in our country. Here, the issue is instead a marriage where the future spouses did not know each other beforehand but wanted to get married in the female spouse's country of origin after becoming acquainted through members of their respective families. The lawfulness of the marriage is not in question here, but rather its \"genuineness\" and the \"intention\" of the spouses.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "It should be recalled that the Act and Regulations do not provide a definition of \"marriage\" and that an arranged marriage or a common-law union are not problematic for the purposes of the application of section 4 of the Regulations as long as the couple are in a \"conjugal\" relationship, that is, a \"genuine\" relationship.

In fact, what the immigration laws do not recognize are situations where the two spouses are complicit to duplicity (a non-genuine marriage) and/or where the intention of the spouses or of one of the spouses is primarily to acquire a status or privilege (even if the other partner may benefit from it). In other jurisdictions, these unions are sometimes described as \"sham\" or \"white\" marriages, whereas in Canada, the manual uses the expression \"marriage of convenience\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "Consequently, whether this is a conventional marriage, an arranged marriage or another type of conjugal relationship, it is essential to find in the couple's relationship a mutual commitment to living together to the exclusion of any other conjugal relationship. The spouses' physical, emotional, financial and social interdependence goes hand in hand with this because, after all, in all cultures and traditions, over and above any religious undertakings, in terms of its civil effects, marriage is, above all, an indeterminate contract requiring that spouses help each other and contribute towards the expenses of the marriage in proportion to their respective means, which certainly includes the activities of each spouse, or even both together, in the home.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "Furthermore, in", "M v H", ", [1999] 2 SCR 3, at paragraph 59, the Supreme Court of Canada referred to the criteria in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. Dist. Ct.) to include relationships that are \"similar to marriage\". It spoke of a conjugal relationship based on generally accepted characteristics: shared shelter, sexual and personal behaviour, services, social activities, economic support, children and the societal perception of the couple. However, these elements may be present in varying degrees and not all are necessary for the relationship to be found conjugal. The same type of criteria can be found in the manual.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "We can expect that the conjugal relationship of a legally married couple or a common-law couple would have the same type of characteristics. That being said, once the marriage has taken place abroad and one of the spouses has stayed in his or her country of origin to wait for the other spouse to sponsor him or her to come reside permanently in Canada, how does one convince the authorities that it was not a marriage of convenience?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "There is no single method of analysis. For example, money transfers, the combining of financial resources, the existence of joint accounts and the purchase of property in the name of both spouses are certainly indicative of financial support or interdependence. Something else that can be verified is how the spouses behave towards one another and towards the authorities in their respective countries. Do they have children? Do they support each other during illnesses? Do they give each other gifts? Do they travel together? Do they live under the same roof when they are in the foreign spouse's country of origin? In what way and how often do they communicate when they are separated?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "Of course, credibility is an aspect central to an officer or panel's analysis of the genuineness of a relationship. The officer or panel is permitted to examine, in particular, the circumstances and the length of the relationship, as well as the marriage itself (location of the wedding, type of wedding, presence of guests). For example, was the marriage ceremony consistent with the beliefs and culture of the spouses? Aside from photos of the ceremony or of the spouses in public places, is there evidence that the spouses actually lived together at any point after their marriage and honeymoon?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "The jurisprudence confirms that there is no specific test or set of tests established for determining whether a marriage or relationship is genuine and that the relative weight to be given to each is exclusively up to the officer or panel ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 23; Khan, above, at paragraph 20).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "For example, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court found that it was reasonable to assess the length of the spouses' relationship before marriage, their age difference, their former marital or civil status, their respective financial situation and employment, their family background, their knowledge of one another's histories, their language, their respective interests, their family ties in Canada and past attempts by the person sponsored to come to Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "Similarly, the Court decided  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "that the panel could not be criticized for considering the circumstances surrounding how the spouses met, their marriage proposal or even the existence of a pull factor for the sponsored spouse to come to Canada despite the existence of material evidence (such as phone bills, written correspondence or money transfers between the spouses) that was, at first glance, favourable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "Finally, the panel is presumed to have considered all of the evidence before it to render its decision (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (FCA)), and the mere fact of not mentioning all of the evidence is not sufficient to rebut the presumption (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "In this case, the applicant submits today that the panel failed to analyze the evidence as a whole and that its analysis with respect to the good faith of the marriage is unreasonable such that there is reason to set aside his decision and return the matter for redetermination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "First, the applicant claims that the impugned decision does not take into account relevant factors and that the panel placed excessive weight on trivial aspects of the spouses' relationship, such as when the applicant's mother met his future spouse for the first time, the dates and sequence of the conversations between the spouses and their respective families, and the number of photos or the frequency of calls the spouses exchanged before meeting.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "Second, the applicant criticizes the panel for failing to consider the fact that it was an arranged marriage and that the spouses' respective families had known each other for a long time. He submits that the panel adopted a North American logic and reasoning without taking into account the cultural context and practices in Cambodia in its assessment of the evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "Third, the applicant criticizes the panel for drawing a negative inference from the fact that he had already been married and had sponsored his first wife, also from Cambodia, whom he divorced just one year after she obtained permanent residence in Canada.

The panel has sole jurisdiction over the facts; it is therefore important to read the panel's decision in its entirety to understand its essence and nuances. Even if another decision-maker may interpret the facts differently, the panel's finding that the applicant failed to discharge the burden of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that his marriage to his new spouse is genuine and was not entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act falls within a range of \"possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 47).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[33]", "The criticisms that the panel failed to consider all of the evidence and relied on irrelevant criteria to arrive at this finding are unjustified. It was open to the panel to place little weight on certain material elements (plane tickets, numerous photos, calling cards, etc.) given the credibility problems identified in the decision. Contrary to what the applicant submits, the panel did not engage in a microscopic analysis of the evidence. Instead, the problem was insufficient explanations provided with respect to aspects central to the exact circumstances of their meeting, the organization of their engagement and marriage, their cohabitation in Cambodia and the maintenance of their long-distance conjugal relationship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[34]", "Except for mentioning a few specific details (the purchase of rings), the applicant, his mother and his spouse made no effort to explain to the panel how, according to Cambodian tradition, a marriage is \"arranged\", whereas here the applicant was more than 30 years old, had already lived in Canada for several years, had already been married and was divorced. Therefore, the applicant cannot criticize the panel today for disregarding or ignoring the fact that it was an \"arranged marriage\". However, in both", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and", "Gill", ", above, the panel did not raise doubt as to the credibility of the appellants' testimony, which makes it possible to differentiate these two matters from the case under consideration.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[35]", "The panel's negative inferences are supported by the evidence in the record and its reasoning is not arbitrary or capricious under the circumstances.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[36]", "For example, the panel noted that the applicant's testimony that his mother met his future spouse during a trip to Cambodia in 2005 contradicts his statement in the sponsor's questionnaire that this first meeting had taken place on September 11, 2006, that is, at the engagement. The applicant explains that his mother might have met his future spouse at her grandparents' house during previous trips to Cambodia. Then why did the applicant's mother speak to him about the young woman only on March 3, 2006, one year later? It was reasonable for the panel to dismiss the explanation that the applicant had been recently divorced and had no intention of remarrying.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[37]", "What is more, in his testimony, the applicant stated that he had spoken with his future spouse for the first time over the phone on June 15, 2006. Yet, in the sponsor's questionnaire, he put August 18, 2006, as the date of their first meeting. The applicant now states that that date was when he had exchanged photos with his spouse. Moreover, the spouses' versions of the photos that were exchanged in August 2006 also present certain discrepancies. The applicant stated that he had sent five or six photos of himself in his convenience store whereas his spouse spoke instead of two photos that seemed to have been taken in a hotel. It should be noted that is it up to the spouses to ensure that the information in the forms is true, complete and accurate, especially since they had ample time to make any necessary changes to them.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[38]", "That is not all, however; the circumstances surrounding the marriage proposal are also nebulous. According to the form completed by the applicant's spouse, it was not the applicant's mother who spoke to her grandparents about marriage, as the applicant indicated in his testimony, but it was instead their respective parents who contacted each other by telephone in August 2006, and it was only later that the spouses spoke over the phone. Yet the applicant stated that he had gotten in touch with his spouse on June 15, 2006. The panel was entitled to disbelieve the applicant when he suggested that this was a simple error.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[39]", "At what point the applicant's spouse, her parents and her grandparents learned of the applicant's divorce is also problematic, as are the circumstances surrounding the moment and circumstances of the applicant's meeting with his first spouse.

Contrary to the applicant's past testimony at the first appeal that he had entered into a romantic relationship with his first spouse in 1995, during the hearing for this application, he testified that he had met his first spouse for the first time during a trip to Cambodia in July 1997 and that he had married her one week later, against his parents' wishes.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[41]", "The payment of the wedding rings exchanged by the future spouses also raised serious questions. According to the applicant, each spouse had purchased their own ring. However, his spouse stated that it was her mother who purchased the applicant's ring and the applicant's mother who purchased hers. When confronted with this, the applicant explained that his spouse had replied this way because, in Cambodian culture, each spouse's mother purchases the other spouse's ring. Subsequently, the applicant changed his testimony: he purchased the two rings because he wanted to show his spouse that he had the financial means to do so. Furthermore, contrary to his spouse's statement, the applicant stated that his mother had accompanied the couple to the market to purchase the rings, but never indicated that his spouse's mother was also present. It was reasonably open to the panel to find that the credibility of the spouses was undermined.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[42]", "In addition, the panel also found it suspicious that the spouses celebrated their engagement less than a month after exchanging photos and were married nine months after the date they spoke over the phone for the first time. The very speed of the events that led to the marriage tends to demonstrate that the marriage was entered into for immigration purposes, a finding that can be drawn from the evidence in the record.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[43]", "Nevertheless, the panel considered the applicant's visits to Cambodia and seemed to recognize that the spouses spent time together in Cambodia and elsewhere. However, the panel did not believe that the spouses had lived together or that it was a genuine relationship, as it explained in its reasons. With respect to the calling cards, the panel found the evidence inconclusive in itself because it is impossible to verify when the calls were made and by whom.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[44]", "Thus, the panel doubted that the applicant had cohabitated with his spouse during his last trip to Cambodia, which lasted three months, even though he testified that he always stayed with his spouse during his visits there. In fact, the panel considered each spouse's lack of knowledge of the basic elements of daily life of the other is not consistent with the allegation that they lived together.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[45]", "For example, the applicant explained that his spouse took two vacation days during his three-month stay in Cambodia, whereas his spouse stated that she took ten. Furthermore, the applicant's spouse believed that it was the applicant's brother who operated the convenience store in Montréal during his stay in Cambodia, whereas the applicant stated that it was his sister-in-law who operated it. On another occasion, the panel stated in its decision that, according to the applicant's spouse, the applicant had told her about his divorce during their first phone conversation in June 2006, whereas she told the immigration officer that she had learned about it when they exchanged photos in August 2006.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[46]", "The above-mentioned findings of fact are not unreasonable and the Court cannot intervene to substitute its own assessment of the evidence for that of the panel.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[47]", "For these reasons, this application for judicial review will be dismissed.

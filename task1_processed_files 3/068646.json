After a closer reading of paragraph 18(b) it is my opinion that the plaintiff is seeking a declaration that he was first to adopt any trademark or trade name with the element of \"copper\" as a finding of fact, which in my view is quite a different situation than in the one before Justice Strayer in the", "Royal Doulton", "case. Further, by seeking such a declaration, the plaintiff is in effect providing the Registrar with directions from the court as to facts which the Registrar is required to find or determine at the first instance with respect to the registrability of a trademark.

That relief, he added, is clearly a relief 'respecting a patent of invention' within the meaning of s. 20 and is also a relief provided for by law since the court is authorized to pronounce declaratory judgments ...", "\"The respondent's contention is, in my view, ill-founded.

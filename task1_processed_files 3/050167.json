Both of these customers stopped ordering these products and one even returned such products.

The defendants did not agree that this witness should be qualified as an expert. After a review of his curriculum vitae, I concluded that his testimony could be helpful in this case. However, on cross-examination, he had to admit that he did not know when the Hilfiger flag design was created. He had no scientific data to support his allegations. He did not know when sales of Hilfiger garments started in Canada and how much they were sold for. Talking about the hip-hop culture, he had no statistics, no data. The same is for the awareness of the public for the Hilfiger logo. He had made no research before signing his affidavit. Therefore, I disregard his entire testimony because I find that it is not convincing and probing evidence."], ["[120]", "The plaintiffs did not present any evidence of actual confusion. Nicola Bavaro, a THC director in Montreal, did mention an incident where a client of a store called Galaxi Blue complained about the Explore Canada products but as Mr. Bavaro did not recall the name of the Galaxi Blue owner and as the store is now closed, no weight can be given to that isolated, unsubstantiated incident.", "Conclusion as to the likelihood of confusion"], ["[121]", "I have taken into account all five factors indicated in s. 6(5) but find that, in four cases, one factor clearly disqualifies a finding that there is a likelihood of confusion."], ["[122]", "Because of the important visual difference between TMA '291 and the Explore Canada logo (TMA '291 is only a word, not a rectangle with colors), I cannot come to the conclusion that the Explore Canada logo infringes TMA '291. I also come to the same conclusion with respect to TMA '827 (rectangle with colors and the words \"Tommy Hilfiger\"), though this situation is not as clear cut as that with TMA '291. TMA '827 presents a rather important visual difference that would prevent a likelihood of confusion in a consumer's mind, i.e. the words \"Tommy Hilfiger\" which are obviously very different from the words found on the defendants' wares, i.e. \"Explore Canada\" or another regional designation."], ["[123]", "Because of the obvious difference in the nature of the wares registered in association with TMA '283 and TMA '082 (cosmetics; perfumery; toiletries; suntan lotions; bronzing sticks; soap products and hair care products in both cases) compared to the wares sold by Quality Goods (shirts, caps, toques, scarves, headbands, outerwear, bags, mugs, pens, key chains, licence plates, playing cards, magnets, hockey pucks, etc.), I find that there is no likelihood of confusion between TMA '283 and TMA '082 and the Explore Canada logo on Quality Goods' products."], ["[124]", "I now turn to the last Hilfiger trademark. I find that the Explore Canada logo does create a likelihood of confusion with Hilfiger's TMA '095 (rectangle with colors without the words \"Tommy Hilfiger\"). Looking at the first element in the confusion analysis, the Hilfiger trademarks is a strong mark because of its originality in design and its acquired distinctiveness through years of extensive publicity and sales. TMA '095 was registered and used a few years (1994) before Quality Goods started using its Explore Canada logo (1996). Some of the wares sold by both parties in association with their respective mark are exactly the same (t-shirts, sweaters, etc.). There is an overlap of some of the stores through which products by both parties are sold (e.g. duty shops and specialty stores). Finally, the degree of visual resemblance is very high, as the only difference between TMA '095 and the Explore Canada logo is the addition, on the latter, of the words \"Explore Canada\" or a regional designation and of the maple leaf or another insignia in the middle of the rectangle. In light of these five factors, I conclude that the Explore Canada logo is likely to cause confusion with TMA '095 and therefore infringes s. 20 of the", "Act", ". In other words, I am satisfied that a probable consumer in a tourist shop who saw in 1996, or even now, an Explore Canada t-shirt for example, would think, as a matter of first impression, that he or she is looking at a Tommy Hilfiger t-shirt that is being sold at a good price.

The 32 year old female applicant, (the principal applicant) fears her former husband, from whom she was separated in 1997. She describes her former spouse as a violent, jealous and vengeful man who has often abused her and threatened to kidnap her son. She never approached the police for protection as her former husband was himself a policeman. She is also accompanied by her minor son."], ["[3]", "The male applicant is the common-law spouse of the principal applicant. He fears the principal applicant's former husband, who threatened his life numerous times and beat him to the point of requiring hospitalization on one occasion in order to intimidate him into leaving the principal applicant. He complained to the police in October 2005, however they refused to register his complaint, and he was instructed to leave the perpetrator alone."], ["[4]", "The male applicant arrived in Canada on March 25, 2006 and claimed Refugee protection on March 28, 2006.

The Board noted that as Mexico was a functioning democracy, the presumption of state protection applies, and thus, in order to rebut that presumption, the applicants must provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect them."], ["[6]", "First, the Board analyzed the claim of the principal applicant. The Board noted that while there remain areas of protection for women which need to be improved, Mexico has taken great strides in protecting its female citizens in the Federal District (F.D.) of Mexico City. The Board was satisfied that a comprehensive legislative scheme was in place that gives victims of domestic violence both protection and recourse in the F.D., and that the state has put in place numerous initiatives that will assist a citizen in accessing the protection and recourse provided by the legislation. However, while all of those efforts do not always provide protection to all citizens, the protection available was adequate."], ["[7]", "Next, the Board examined the male applicant's claim and focused on his failure to complain about the inefficiency of the police to other institutions. The Board stated that local failures to provide protection do not amount to a lack of state protection and that pursuant to the documentary evidence, if the applicant was dissatisfied with police efforts or concerned that police corruption was a factor, there were avenues open through which he could seek redress. The Board recognized that there is serious crime and corruption in Mexico, but documentary evidence indicates that serious efforts are being made by the government to tackle this problem as well as the problem with drug traffickers.", "I.

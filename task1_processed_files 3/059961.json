Most of the Respondent's trips were to Hong Kong, for business - or work-related purposes. Some were to the United States for tourism. At least some, though it is not quite clear how many, were to accompany one of his sons, who is suffers from some mental illness, for treatment at a clinic in Hong Kong.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The Respondent applied for Canadian citizenship on June 15, 2005.

The Respondent appealed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [", "Wong I", "], Justice Michael Phelan allowed the Respondent's appeal. Phelan J. held that the citizenship judge failed to consider the Respondent's residence in Canada prior to the material period; confused the various residence tests; and, most importantly, failed to consider the quality of the Respondent's connection with Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The Respondent's application was then remitted to the citizenship judge, who approved it.

The paragraph in the \"Note to File\" form reads:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "After personal interview and reviewing the requested documents i.e. Hong Kong record of movement, CRA Notice of Assessments (sic), Bank statements,", "oral submissions,", "Family presence in Canada for past 13 years, Canadian citizen, reason for travel being his son's treatment for autism, having declared all absences as per application and res. questionnaire, I am satisfied that client has set up residence in Canada and has maintained it.

However, in my view it was the obligation of the Citizenship Judge to assess whether residency had been established, particularly where the Applicant and his family had been in Canada for 12 years, owning their own home, where members of the family had become citizens of Canada and to where the Applicant, having traveled from Canada to other points, including Hong Kong, always returned.

I agree with the Minister.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "In a recent case,", "Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [", "Mahmoud", "], at par. 6, Justice Roger Hughes noted that, because the Minister - or, I would add, a citizenship applicant - has no remedy other than an appeal to this Court, and citizenship must be granted in the event of a positive recommendation by a citizenship judge, \"the provision of reasons by the citizenship judge assumes a special significance. The reasons should be sufficiently clear and detailed so as to demonstrate to the Minister that all relevant facts have been considered and weighed appropriately and that the correct legal tests have been applied. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "Needless to say, the citizenship judge's reasons ought to speak for themselves.

It is noteworthy that he did not use the existing form listing the six questions of that test and providing space for an answer to each.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "The Minister - or, in other cases, applicants - should not have to guess why a citizenship application is granted or denied.

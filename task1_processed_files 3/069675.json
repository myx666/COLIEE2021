When he refused, they had charges laid against him."], ["[6]", "While the principal applicant was detained, his parents realized that his visa would expire before his trial was held. Therefore, in November 2010, they travelled to the High Commission in New Delhi to request an extension. On their first visit, the office was closed. On their second visit, they were informed at the reception desk that it was not possible to extend visas and that they were not permitted to speak with a visa officer."], ["[7]", "With the expiration of their visas looming, the principal applicant's parents left India and arrived in Canada on December 27, 2010."], ["[8]", "The applicant's trial was held on March 9, 2011.

With the request, they included copies of the Court judgment acquitting the principal applicant and an updated police clearance for him.", "Officer's Decision"], ["[10]", "In an email dated April 28, 2011, the officer denied the applicants' request to extend the principal applicant's visa. The officer stated that it was not possible to reopen the file."], ["[11]", "The officer indicated that he had reviewed the detailed information that had been submitted and found it unfortunate that the principal applicant was unable to accompany his parents due to the false charges against him.

Did the officer err in failing to exercise jurisdiction?", "2. Was the decision unlawfully made, in that the officer breached the duty of fairness by failing to provide adequate reasons?", "3. Was the decision so unreasonable having regard to the evidence properly before the officer so as to amount to an error of law?"], ["[13]", "I would rephrase the issues as follows:", "1. What is the appropriate standard of review?", "2. Did the officer err in failing to exercise jurisdiction or in fettering his discretion?", "3. Did the officer deny the applicants procedural fairness?", "4. Should this application be dismissed because the applicants are not coming to Court with clean hands?", "Applicants' Written Submissions"], ["[14]", "The applicants submit that questions of jurisdiction and procedural fairness are reviewable on a correctness standard. The applicants acknowledge that the exercise of discretion is normally subject to a reasonableness standard. However, they submit that the issues raised in this case are jurisdictional, which attract a correctness standard."], ["[15]", "The applicants submit that the officer refused to extend the principal applicant's visa because the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC)'s Operations Manual OP-1 Procedures (the OP-1 Manual) only authorized extensions in one limited instance. The principal applicant needed an extension for a different reason. The officer therefore concluded that it was not possible to extend the visa. This error can be characterized in two ways. Either the officer committed an error of jurisdiction by refusing to exercise jurisdiction or the officer fettered his discretion by limiting its exercise to the example provided in the OP-1 Manual."], ["[16]", "The applicants submit that there is nothing in the Act or the", "Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations", ", SOR/2002-227 (the Regulations) that speaks to the extension or expiry of a permanent resident visa. The OP-1 Manual does state that permanent resident visas are not to be extended. However, it also provides an exception to this rule where applicants receive visas less than two months before their expiry."], ["[17]", "The applicants infer from the information given to the principal applicant's parents at the High Commission in New Delhi and the officer's refusal to extend the visa on the basis that it was not possible, that the officer believed that there was no jurisdiction to extend a visa. The applicants submit that this is an error of jurisdiction because an officer has discretion to revisit the issuance of a visa. This is an administrative decision that is not governed by the principles of finality that govern Court judgments. The applicants submit that this Court has held that where circumstances come to light that call for an officer to consider them, the officer can reconsider visa issuance and extensions thereof."], ["[18]", "Further, if the officer was acting on the belief that the policy in the OP-1 Manual prohibited him from extending the visa, this was an error. These policies are guidelines and are not to be treated as mandatory law. Where an officer abides strictly to the guidelines without considering the particular facts of a case, they unlawfully fetter their discretion. In this case, the applicants submit that the officer did not refuse the extension on the basis of the merits of the case but rather on the basis that the visa had been issued in a timely fashion prior to its expiry and it could therefore not be extended."], ["[19]", "The applicants also submit that the officer merely provided a conclusion, without any supporting explanation or analysis. This did not constitute adequate reasons. The inadequacy of the reasons is exacerbated by the fact that this decision was critical to the future of the applicants as a cohesive family. As the principal applicant is now over the age of 22, he no longer qualifies as a dependent of his parents and can thus not be sponsored by them, as was suggested by the officer. This limitation was included in the submissions that were before the officer when he rendered his decision. By ignoring this evidence, the officer did not fully appreciate the importance of the extension to the family. It was unreasonable for the officer to come to a conclusion without regard to the evidence before him.", "Respondent's Written Submissions"], ["[20]", "The respondent submits that in determining the applicable standard of review it is important to bear in mind that the legislation does not expressly permit a visa officer to extend the time limit on expired permanent resident visas or to restore expired visas. In the absence of such clear legislative intent, the visa officer's discretion is very limited. As such, a review of the exercise of this discretion should be made against the reasonableness standard. Similarly, as recently stated by the Supreme Court, the adequacy of reasons is not a stand-alone basis for quashing a decision and any challenge to the reasoning or result of a decision should also be made within the reasonableness analysis."], ["[21]", "The respondent submits that once a visa expires, it becomes void. Although the legislation expressly permits extensions or restorations in certain circumstances, there are no legislative provisions authorizing a restoration of an expired permanent resident visa. Similarly, the OP-1 Manual states that the validity of a permanent resident visa may not be extended and the cover letter attached to the visas sent to the applicant also stated that the visa could not be extended."], ["[22]", "The respondent submits that a close examination of the factual and legislative context reveals that the decision is reasonable. In support, the respondent highlights the following:", "The visa had its maximum validity when received by the applicants;", "The visa was null and void for almost five months when the request to extend its validity was made;", "The legislation does not expressly permit extension or restoration of a visa;", "The OP-1 Manual does identify a circumstance where extension may be granted; and", "The officer's decision that the principal applicant's case was not similar to that circumstance deserves deference."], ["[23]", "The respondent submits that the officer did not reject the request without thought or study. Rather, the officer reviewed the detailed information submitted and determined that the case did not warrant reopening. As the officer was free to exercise his limited discretion, the decision to refuse to reopen the file was within the range of possible acceptable outcomes."], ["[24]", "Further, rather than being rejected out of hand, the request was substantively considered. The respondent submits that the applicants are merely equating a negative decision with a refusal to exercise discretion. In addition, the respondent submits that the officer did not decline jurisdiction by deciding the case in accordance with the OP-1 Manual as that was exactly what the applicants had requested. The officer simply did not agree with the applicants' reading of the OP-1 Manual. As this administrative guidance contemplates persons who had insufficient notice of their visa, the respondent submits that the officer's reading of the OP-1 Manual was reasonable."], ["[25]", "The respondent also submits that the decision was reasonable as the request for extension was based on material facts that should have been disclosed before the principal applicant obtained landing. Section 51 of the Regulations requires foreign nationals holding permanent resident visas to report any changes with their family situation. Similarly, the cover letter accompanying the visas clearly stated that any criminal charges or convictions had to be reported prior to departure for Canada. The applicants did not abide to these requirements in their correspondence with the officer (during the processing of their application) or in their visit to the High Commission."], ["[26]", "The respondent submits that the reasons were adequate. The content of the duty of procedural fairness in decisions of visa officers is at the low end of the spectrum. This is particularly true where the decision under review is a request to have a file reopened. The reasons show that the officer considered the applicant's submissions and determined that the request could not be granted. As such, the reasons permit this Court to understand why the officer made his decision and to determine whether the officer's conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes."], ["[27]", "Finally, the respondent submits that this Court should dismiss the applicants'application or refuse to grant the remedy sought because they are not coming to Court with clean hands due to their failure to make a timely disclosure of the charges. By failing to make timely disclosure of the principal applicant's criminal charges, the applicants effectively misled immigration authorities.", "Applicants' Written Reply"], ["[28]", "The applicants criticize the respondent's assertion that the lack of explicit statutory authority to extend the validity of a visa indicates that the discretion is very limited. Rather, the exercise of discretion depends on the context and can be broad where equitable factors are considered."], ["[29]", "The applicants submit that they are not merely equating a negative decision with a refusal to exercise jurisdiction. The officer did not say that he reviewed the facts and decided not to exercise his discretion. Rather, he said it was not possible to reopen the file, thereby indicating that he did not have the authority to do so. As such, it was a refusal to exercise jurisdiction, not a decision on the merits."], ["[30]", "The applicants also submit that the requirements of fairness are not based solely on the character of the decision maker or the location of the applicant, but are also based on the interests at stake. In this case, the officer's decision has resulted in the youngest member of the family being left behind in India. The decision is therefore significant to the applicants and their family, thereby warranting greater procedural fairness.", "Analysis and Decision", "Issue 1", "What is the appropriate standard of review?"], ["[31]", "The parties disagree on the appropriate standard of review. However, this disagreement pertains primarily to the classification of the issues that arise on this application. The applicants argue that the main issue pertains to jurisdiction, whereas the respondent submits that this application is nothing more than an assessment of the officer's exercise of discretion. The evaluation of these separate issues is presented further below. Here, the question is limited to what the appropriate standard of review is for the different issues."], ["[32]", "Where previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[33]", "Subsection 11(1) of the Act requires foreign nationals who wish to reside permanently in Canada to apply for and obtain visas before coming to Canada.

Officers may issue this visa if they are satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of the Act (subsection 11(1) of the Act). There are no explicit provisions in either the Act or the Regulations that state whether or not visa officers may extend or renew permanent residence visas.

As such, it can enable an agency to deal with a problem comprehensively and proactively, rather than incrementally and reactively on a case by case basis (see", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED).

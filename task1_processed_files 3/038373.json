I agree. The Regulations do not contain a requirement that an applicant become economically self-sufficient in his or her qualifying occupation or join the labor market in the particular occupation they refer to in their application (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED); and this is not what the Officer asked for in this case. But, as stated in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED, since these are the skills that an applicant would likely rely on to make a living, it is reasonable for a visa officer to verify whether the applicant would be able to practice in the field they mention. So it was certainly logical and reasonable for the Officer to consider, as a relevant though not determinative consideration, Ms. Pathirannahelage's ability to work in her field of physiotherapy in Canada."], ["[51]", "Ms. Pathirannahelage argues that the", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "case is distinguishable on its facts, but I fail to see how. In", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", ", the applicant had experience working in Ayurvedic medicine, but the visa officer was concerned because this type of medicine is not regulated in Canada and concluded that the applicant would not be able to work in that field in Canada. In the present case, physiotherapists require a certain university education and licensing in order to practice, a concern highlighted by the Officer as that could mean Ms. Pathirannahelage would not be able to work in that field. That said, this is not a situation where, as in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED, a visa officer has unreasonably insisted that the applicant demonstrate economic self-sufficiency as a skilled worker in her particular field of skilled work. The evidence on the record and the Decision do not support the proposition that the Officer was requiring Ms. Pathirannahelage to demonstrate her ability to work as a physiotherapist as a condition to be convinced she would be able to successfully establish in Canada. It was just one of many factors considered by the Officer."], ["[52]", "In the end, I find that the Officer's reasons for his Decision are transparent and justifiable and that his decision on the negative substituted evaluation is one which falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes justified by the facts and the law (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED).", "VIII.", "Conclusion"], ["[53]", "For the foregoing reasons, this application for judicial review is dismissed. The Officer has met his duty of procedural fairness by discussing his concerns with Ms. Pathirannahelage during the interview and in sending the procedural fairness letter to Ms. Pathirannahelage. There was no breach of procedural fairness. With respect to the Officer's negative substituted evaluation, I find that, in the circumstances of this case, the decision of the Officer was reasonable."], ["[54]", "Neither party has proposed a serious question of general importance for certification, and I agree there is none (REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[55]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "1.

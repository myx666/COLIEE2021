The RPD Panel is in a better position to assess the Applicant's credibility, and while it is possible that he misunderstood the question, to draw a negative inference from his failure to mention his younger brother's incarceration until asked about it specifically is not unreasonable.", "(3) The Applicant's Wife"], ["[32]", "While I agree with the Applicant that the RPD Panel's determination, upheld by the RAD Panel, regarding his wife returning to Ethiopia does not appear to have been made with regard to his statement that Ethiopian authorities were unaware of their marriage, and thus she would not be targeted as having been married to him, I find that the RPD Panel's findings were not unreasonable. The Panel assessed that the Applicant feared persecution from the state in Ethiopia and it is understandable that absent evidence of the Applicant's wife's difficulty facing a journey to North America, it would seem counter intuitive that he would send his wife back to the state where he alleges his entire family, among others, were so persecuted. The RPD Panel member was reasonable in finding that it did not seem consistent with his claimed subjective fear.", "(4) The Applicant's Older Brother"], ["[33]", "The Applicant appears to have given inconsistent testimony about collecting, or not collecting, his older brother's body at the prison facility where he died.

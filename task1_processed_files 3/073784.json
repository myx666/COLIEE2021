Therefore, it says, there is no causal connection between the loss of sales and the infringement of the patents."], ["[31]", "The fallacy in Apotex's submission is that casual connection must be determined based on an examination of the facts as they existed at the relevant time - not on those that could have existed. Just as was no defence for Mr. Clements to say that the nail could have fallen out of the tire before he increased speed and when he was riding a properly loaded bike, and therefore there is no causal connection between his negligence and his wife's injury, it is no defence for Apotex to say that it could have manufactured and sold non-infringing cefaclor and therefore there is no causal connection between its sale of the infringing product and Lilly's lost sales."], ["[32]", "I concur with Mr. Creber who said: \"I am not aware of any Canadian case that has allowed a tortfeasor, the person who committed the tort, to pretend they could have acted differently whether that be personal injury, whether it be negligence, whether it be patent infringement. ...

It must prove on the balance of probabilities that but for the sales of the infringing product, it would have made additional sales; and it must prove the number of those additional sales and the profit that it would have realized on them. I also agree with the submission of Apotex that damages for lost profits have been denied where the causal link between the infringement and the lost sales has not been established. Apotex brought examples to the court's attention where a patentee was denied recovery of its alleged lost profits on the sales made by the infringer because it was unable to prove that it would have made those sales, but for the infringing product being on the market. I summarize these examples as follows: (1) where the infringed patents are usually licensed by the patentee, the patentee's loss is limited to the royalty it usually charges:", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED; (2) where the infringing sales occur in markets where the patentee does not operate it is limited to recover only a reasonable royalty:", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "; (3) where the patentee would not have made the infringing sales because it had ineffective distribution or marketing:", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED; (4) where the plaintiff would not have made the infringing sales because of customer dissatisfaction and its refusal to deal with the patentee:", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "; and (5) where there is a competitive market-place and it is shown that some of the infringing sales would have been made by a third party competitor:", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED."], ["[34]", "Each example is based on a fact relating to the conduct of the patentee or a third party - not on a hypothetical and most certainly not on hypothetical behaviour of the infringer.

Damages arise if Lilly proves in the real world that, but for Apotex selling infringing product, it would have made some or all of those sales. The causal connection is not examined in the hypothetical world where the infringer engages in different conduct than that in which it actually engaged. Such an approach permits the wrong-doer to escape all responsibility for its conduct. It would permit an infringer who is aware that there are two manufacturing processes, one that infringes and one that does not, to choose the infringing process comforted in the knowledge that the NIA Defence will permit it to escape most if not all of the consequences of its wrongful act. Although damages for patent infringement are not intended to punish infringers, neither are they intended to reward them.", "2. Accounting of profits"], ["[36]", "If a plaintiff elects an accounting of profits rather than damages, then the availability of alternatives to the infringing product is considered.

As in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", ", the task was to assess the profit made by the infringer from its use of the invention. That profit was held to be the difference in the profit the farmer would have realized had he planted a non-patented seed and that which he realized having planted the patented seed. This formula discloses that portion of the infringer's profit that is causally related to the invention - the ability to spray the crop with herbicide without damaging it."], ["[40]", "The NIA is considered when one accounts for an infringer's profit because one must identify what profit it directly attributable to the", "use", "of the invention.

The damage suffered by the patentee is every sale lost", "in the real world", "as a result of the defendant's infringing activity. It is not, as Apotex would suggest, and as stated by its expert Dr. Aidan Hollis, limited by the value of the patent, i.e. the value the patent otherwise brings to a product producible by some alternative non-infringing method.

I too reject it."], ["[44]", "As was noted by Justice Snider, the but-for world of section 8 is found within a specialized and comprehensive regulatory scheme distinct from damage assessments under section 55 of the", "Patent Act", ". In any event, the probable conduct of the \"wrong-doer\" patentee had the NOC been permitted to issue to the generic, is based on evidence of what it has done in the past. If it has most frequently licensed an authorized generic in the past when a NOC was granted to a generic, then it is probable it would have done so had the Minister not been prevented from issuing a NOC to the plaintiff generic. An argument by the patentee that it would have granted a license to an authorized generic in the absence of any evidence that it had done so previously will be met with extreme scientism."], ["[45]", "In my view, there is a material difference in principle between determining what a patentee would have done had a NOC been permitted to issue (the section 8", "PMNOC Regulations", "situation) and determining what the patentee would have done but for the action of the infringer (the section 55", "Patent Act", "situation). I do not accept the submission of Apotex that in the section 55 situation one must consider that the infringer was at liberty to act in a non-infringing manner. That asks the wrong question. It asks: \"But for the infringement, what", "could", "the", "infringer", "have done?\" The proper question to ask is: \"But for the infringement, what", "would", "the", "patentee", "have done?\" It is only the latter question that discloses the damage sustained by the patentee by reason of the infringement.", "4.

Awarding the patentee lost profits premised on its having captured all of the defendant's infringing sales thus results in overcompensation. The correct remedy to restore the patentee to the position it would have occupied but-for the infringement is a reasonable royalty calculated on the basis of what the parties would have agreed to in arms-length negotiations prior to the infringement (e.g., some portion of the defendant's expected cost savings from using the infringing process as opposed to the next-best available noninfringing alternative).

The recitation of the evidence of Dr. Sherman in this regard at paras 827-834 evidences the determination of Apotex to enter the cefaclor market but only, it appears, with infringing material.

Apotex offered evidence that it does not conduct a profitability analysis on its individual products before marketing them, so entering the market with a legal cefaclor product could not have been motivated by any direct financial incentive. Other than its general desire to have as many pharmaceutical products in the marketplace as possible, it offered no evidence that its wish to add cefaclor to its portfolio would have prompted it to seek out a non-infringing method prior to patent expiry."], ["[69]", "In this respect, although Lilly urged the court to find that Apotex would not have been in the market until after the last of the patents - one of the Lilly Patents - expired on July 26, 2000, it conceded in oral argument that Apotex could have produced a non-infringing cefaclor using the Kyong Bo process after the last of the Shionogi Patents expired on April 19, 2000."], ["[70]", "For the reasons expressed above, I find that Apotex would not have been in the cefaclor market prior to April 19, 2000, when the last of the Shionogi Patents expired.

I also accept that her view on likely listing dates is arguably optimistic when one compares it to the real world listing of Apotex's cefaclor. On the other hand, when one is looking at a situation where the patent will soon expire, and Apotex is aware that Lilly has an authorized generic waiting in the wings, I accept that Apotex would work hard to come to market as soon as possible after the patent expiry date."], ["[76]", "In that scenario, Ms. Bacovsky was the only witness who provided an opinion as to likely listing dates. Lilly called no expert, and I find Ms Bacovsky's evidence in this regard persuasive. She examined all of the material facts, the existing provincial policies and procedures, and the Provincial Reimbursement Advisor newsletters included in Exhibit C to her affidavit. At paragraphs 31 and 32 of her report, she explains that she \"assumed that in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, where formularies were updated through legislation, that the dates of changes to the formularies would remain the same in the hypothetical launch scenarios.\" In all of the other provinces, where there is flexibility in the updating of the formularies, she assumed that the various provinces would wish to start benefiting from the generic drug as soon as possible. This approach, she says, is \"consistent with my own experience.\" In my view, these assumptions are reasonable and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I adopt them."], ["[77]", "Based on these assumptions and relying on the data contained in Ms. Bacovsky's report, I conclude that the formulary listing dates in the various provinces for Apotex's cefaclor following a launch date of April 19, 2000, are as follows:", "British Columbia", "April 19, 2000", "Alberta", "April 19, 2000", "Saskatchewan", "May 1, 2000", "Manitoba", "May 15, 2000", "Ontario", "July 17, 2000", "Quebec", "May 17, 2000", "New Brunswick", "April 19, 2000", "Nova Scotia", "May 1, 2000", "Newfoundland & Labrador", "April 19, 2000", "I find that Lilly would have occupied the market entirely in each province until the formulary listing date in that province, as reflected in the chart above.", "VII.", "The Size of the Market"], ["[78]", "All experts agree that the size of the cefaclor market in the but-for world would be the same as it was in the real world.

That is of particular significance in this case as the uncontested evidence is that the amount of free goods distributed by all of the cefaclor manufacturers was significantly greater than usual. Accordingly, if one uses IMS CD&H data to obtain ex-factory sales, one must add to it the free goods provided by the manufacturers to reflect the volume of goods manufacturers had actually placed in the market."], ["[85]", "The second challenge in using IMS CD&H data to ascertain the market size of a generic manufacturer in the period commencing with the launch of its product, is that the volume of goods leaving the generic manufacturer in that period will not accurately reflect the volume a brand company would have sold had the generic not been in the market. This is because wholesalers and chains purchase sufficient inventory so that they have goods readily available for sale. Accordingly, when a generic manufacturer first launches a drug, the wholesalers and chains purchase more than is immediately needed in order to create an inventory from which to fill future prescriptions. Mr. Harington testified that in his experience the amount of product in the pipe typically is a six to eight week supply. This is known as \"pipefill.\" When a drug is first marketed, IMS CD&H data will exaggerate the number of sales that the brand company would have made and an adjustment needs to be made to reflect that fact."], ["[86]", "The other available data is IMS Rx data which reflects prescriptions actually filled. Measured at this point, it includes free goods given to wholesalers and chains, but sold to consumers. It does not, however, reflect sales made to fill the pipe. Accordingly, as Mr. Harington observed the difference between IMS Rx data and IMS CD&H data from market entry is the amount of goods in the pipe."], ["[87]", "Mr. Harington also noted that there needs to be an adjustment to the IMS CD&H data if, following the end of the relevant period, goods are returned to the manufacturer. Return of goods will typically occur after a generic enters the market. Wholesalers and chains will have an inventory of the brand-name pharmaceutical that exceeds demand after generic entry because the generic product will occupy most if not all of the market. They return these goods to the pharmaceutical manufacturer. Mr. Harington referred to this as negative pipefill."], ["[88]", "Mr. Harington accounted for this in his report, while Mr. Sims, Lilly's expert, did not. I agree with Mr. Harington that it must be accounted for. As he testified: \"If 100 goods go out, ten come back, if one wants to understand what adjustment needs to be made to the market, it is only an additional 90 that was in the market.\""], ["[89]", "Mr. Harington's approach is preferred over that of Mr. Sims because it accords with the reality that Lilly should not be credited with sales that are eventually returned to it."], ["[90]", "Mr. Sims prepared his initial report on the basis of IMS CD&H data, believing that the data included free goods. It does not.

He subsequently authored two additional calculations - one based on IMS CD&H with free goods and the other based on IMS Rx data. He used the IMS Rx data to confirm his assessment of the IMS CD&H. The IMS Rx data, as he noted is pure - in that it reflects actual prescriptions filled and there is no need to adjust it for free goods. He took comfort in the fact that the IMS Rx data more closely reflected his assessment of the IMS CD&H data inclusive of free goods than it did Mr. Sims' assessment. This is a further reason why his opinion was preferred."], ["[92]", "Mr. Harington testified that \"substantially all of the difference\" between he and Mr. Sims in their respective calculation of Lilly's lost profits related to their respective views of Apotex's penetration rate into the market.

It had achieved full market penetration. However, in the but-for world, Apotex entered the market no earlier than April 19, 2000, it had to achieve formulary listing, and following listing, it would take some time to achieve full market penetration."], ["[95]", "Mr. Sims' calculations assumed that the penetration of Apotex in the but-for world would be the same as in the real world.

I agree with him that Mr. Sims' approach is based on a \"simplistic assumption\" that there is no change in formulary listing and market penetration even though there is a time difference between the two scenarios.

He was qualified as \"an expert in economics, the valuation of intellectual property and the assessment of damages for patent infringement, including reasonable royalty damages, with particular expertise in the economics of pharmaceutical markets.\""], ["[98]", "Mr. Weinstein's opinion was based on the fact that Apotex paid $1,500 US/kg for non-infringing Lupin 2 and $1,005 US/kg for the infringing cefaclor. In his view, the parties would have negotiated over the difference of $495 US/kg, being the cost saving to Apotex. Using the Nash bargaining solution, Mr. Weinstein concludes that they would have negotiated a royalty of $248 US/kg, being a 50/50 split."], ["[99]", "In my view, that is a simplistic approach to the question of a reasonable royalty and arguably does not even do justice to the Nash bargaining solution. A proper reasonable royalty rate, even under the Nash bargaining solution, must be arrived at by examining the relevant facts and circumstances of the situation at hand, as well as the character of the hypothetical negotiations that the parties would have engaged in at the relevant time considering those facts and circumstances. The relevant facts and circumstances include the availability of alternatives to the patented process, the relative bargaining strength of the parties, and the relationship between the parties. The creation of a legal fiction of a willing licensor and a willing licensee, in my view, does not demand that they be equally willing. One must inquire of each party how willing it is. Is this a marriage of equals or a shotgun wedding?"], ["[100]", "I agree with Lilly that Mr. Weinstein's report is flawed in that his opinion is premised on the availability of a non-infringing alternative that \"could\" have been available to Apotex when it commenced its infringing activity. There is no support for that premise in law or on the evidence."], ["[101]", "Mr. Sims, Lilly's expert, argued that the reasonable royalty rate should be at least $1,119 CAN/kg. He concludes this based on the up to $1,119 CAN/kg premium Apotex paid for non-infringing Lupin 2 over the lowest price it paid for infringing cefaclor. Lilly argued that the reasonable royalty rate should be closer to the highest price Apotex paid for Lupin 2 ($2,500 CAN/kg) given the relative bargaining positions of the parties."], ["[102]", "In my view, the reasonable royalty rate that these parties would negotiate given their respective market positions and circumstances at the commencement of infringement (when Lupin 2 was not known) is greater than $1,119 CAN/kg, but not by as much as Lilly submits. In my view, one must consider that Lilly does not enter into royalty agreements except with an authorized generic which is not the situation at hand. One must also consider that these parties are engaged in litigation on a regular and recurring basis. This leads me to the view that Lilly is less likely to be willing to negotiate a deal unless it is of the view that it has \"bettered\" Apotex in the negotiated deal. Apotex has stressed throughout the trial that it is in the business of expanding its catalogue of pharmaceuticals which suggests it would be eager to strike a deal, regardless of the profit it might make on that single product. On the other hand, given the financial wherewithal of Lilly, it is unlikely to see any great financial advance to entering into a deal unless it does better than 50/50. For these reasons, I find that the parties would have negotiated a reasonable royalty of $1,500 CAN/kg."], ["[103]", "There is a difference between Mr. Sims and Mr. Harington as to the total material that is subject to royalty.

Any discounting of compound interest by the court on this record would be nothing more than mere speculation.

It is commended for doing so. Lilly's lost profits before interest is $31,234,000."], ["[134]", "The parties have been unable to agree on the amount of prejudgment interest. They disagree on the applicable rate and whether it ought to be calculated quarterly or only at year end."], ["[135]", "Lilly proposes to calculate the prejudgment interest using the fixed rate set out at paragraph 125 of the Reasons and that it should be calculated quarterly rather than annually. Apotex proposes that the rate vary each year to reflect Lilly's actual yearly profit margin and that it should be calculated annually. Each party offers numerous criticisms of the other's model. Lilly complains, in part, that the Apotex model provides it with no prejudgment interest on its 1997 lost profits until December 31, 1998, and then only for 12 months. Apotex complains, in part, that Lilly's model generates more by way of prejudgment interest than would have been realized by Lilly as profits. There is some merit to each party's position. There is no way that the awarded prejudgment interest will exactly match the lost profits that would have been generated had the infringing conduct not occurred. The court was well aware of that and took a broad axe approach when it set out in the Reasons the basis of the prejudgment interest calculation."], ["[136]", "Prejudgment interest is to be calculated annually at December 31st of each year at the fixed rate set out in paragraph 125 of the Reasons. According to the calculation provided by Mr. Harington in Apotex's correspondence of January 9, 2015, which is accepted, this results in prejudgment interest of $74,501,000 to December 31, 2014, and daily prejudgment interest thereafter of $23,463."], ["[137]", "Counsel are unable to agree upon the quantum of costs.

It received judgment more favourable than both. The first such written offer was made on March 3, 2010. I do not accept the submissions of Apotex that I should use my discretion and not award increased costs under Rule 420 of the Federal Courts Rules. After March 3, 2010, Lilly is entitled to recover its fees at double the rate.", "c) Lilly is entitled to tax costs of one senior counsel and one junior counsel, provided two were present, at all pre-trial procedures, save and except for those where a judge or prothonotary ordered that a motion was to be without costs or was silent as to costs.", "d) Lilly is entitled to tax costs at trial of two senior counsel and one junior counsel.", "e) Lilly is entitled to tax the reasonable disbursements of counsel for travel, accommodation and related expenses on the basis of economy fare and single rooms.", "f) No costs or disbursements are recoverable for in-house counsel, law clerks, students, paralegals, or other support staff.", "g) Subject to the following comments concerning the fees of Mr. Sims, Lilly is entitled to recover the expert fees paid for those persons who deposed affidavits filed in this action and also testified at the trial, at the lesser of the actual fees charged or the daily rate of senior counsel, but shall not include any fee related to assisting counsel in the preparation of the case or responding to discovery questions. Apotex notes that Mr. Sims' fees are in excess of $1.5 Million which, it is submitted, is excessive. It proposes that his fees be capped at 50% of the fees of Mr. Harington, or $405,000. In addition, it points out that the court preferred the evidence of Mr. Harington over Mr. Sims, and there was an error in Mr. Sims' report that he was required to correct and which required additional work by Mr. Harington. Both are valid considerations. Accordingly, the expert fees and related disbursements charged by Mr. Sims for his Addendum which corrected an error in his earlier report are not recoverable, and, the recoverable fees related to Mr. Sims are capped at 75% of the fees charged by Mr. Harington, i.e. $607,500.00, exclusive of HST.", "h) Lilly is entitled to recover the reasonable disbursements billed by those experts whose fees are recoverable.", "i) Lilly is entitled to recover the fees and disbursements paid to fact witnesses who testified at trial but shall not be entitled to recover any fee paid to any such witness who was an employee of Lilly at the time of giving evidence.

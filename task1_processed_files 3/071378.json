Further, the female applicant's health records show no use from July 5, 2000 to November 2001, as well as nothing after June 2002 to the time of the citizenship application.

Whether the citizenship judge would have said that there was no health card use from the end of July 2000, as oppose to just July 2000, is inconsequential in the present matter. The fact still remains that there was no record of health card use for an extended period of time."], ["[16]", "The applicants submit that the citizenship judge erred in law when she pointed out that each applicant did not have a record of health card use after June 2002.

Even if the applicants' interpretation of the request for the health records is acceptable, it would certainly not estop the citizenship judge from relying on the health records for the period of February 21, 2000 to mid 2002. The disclosed health records covered the period of February 2000 to June 2002 and showed no health card use whatsoever for the female applicant from the end of July 2000 to November 2001. The lack of health card use over the aforementioned period of 16 months is contrary to the female applicant's repeated assertions of health card use for that period of time at the cross-examination. It was reasonable for the citizenship judge to rely on the health card records and to draw a negative inference based on the information they contained."], ["[18]", "The applicants claim that when the calculation of time by the citizenship judge is unclear and there is a live issue as to the actual number of days an applicant is absent from Canada, the application must be remitted back to a different citizenship judge for redetermination.

In Shakoor (supra),Justice O'Keefe was referring to whether it was unclear that the citizenship judge took into consideration absences from Canada after the date of application for Canadian citizenship in determining the applicants days of residency.

It is, as well, a clearly-established rule that the courts should not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a statutory authority merely because the court might have exercised the discretion in a different manner had it been charged with that responsibility.

It was open to the officer to prefer certain evidential materials over others and it was fully in his right to prefer the employer's job description to that of the applicant. It was also open to the officer to prefer the documentary evidence to the applicant's oral evidence.

However, in the present case, the officer did confront the applicant with the contradictory job descriptions and offered him a chance to explain the inconsistencies.

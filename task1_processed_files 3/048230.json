Although the decision does not turn on the history of this marriage, it is of some significance. This marriage came about as a result of a matrimonial advertisement that appeared in a newspaper. The parents considering the match suitable for Rupinder, they responded to the said advertisement. At the time of the settlement of marriage, no demand of dowry was placed, and it was agreed that Mr. Randhawa would sponsor Rupinder so that she could become a Canadian permanent resident."], ["[4]", "Unfortunately, things did not work out as expected. Mr. Randhawa came to India for a short period of time to solemnize the marriage. But the day after, the family of the groom began to complain about the size of the dowry provided by Rupinder's family. These complaints and demands escalated. Mr. Randhawa and his family threatened that if Rupinder's family did not provide a sizable amount of money, he would not sponsor her to join him in Canada. She was also told her family could no longer sponsor her and that she had no choice but to pay the dowry. The harassment escalated to the point where Rupinder determined that she did not wish to maintain her relationship with her new husband. By May 30, 2005, the relationship irreconcilably ended. Indeed, she filed a complaint with the Indian police on June 8, 2005 and filed a divorce petition on July 9, 2005."], ["[5]", "After the marriage broke down, the Dehar family became concerned about whether Rupinder would still be able to be sponsored.

As such, this is squarely a question of law and the parties agreed it should be reviewed on the standard of correctness."], ["[14]", "The appropriate standard of review for the issue of whether Rupinder was continuously enrolled in and attending an educational institution must be determined by a pragmatic and functional analysis."], ["[15]", "The first factor is whether the legislation contains a privative clause or a right of appeal. As the", "Immigration and Refugee Protection Act", "contains neither, this factor is neutral."], ["[16]", "The question of whether or not Rupinder was \"attending\" a post-secondary institution that is accredited by the relevant government authority involves an interpretation of the definition of \"dependent child\" as well as findings of fact. While the visa officer is definitely in a better position than this Court to determine whether a particular educational institution is indeed an accredited post-secondary institution, how the classes are conducted, what are the courses of study and the diplomas conferred, and whether the applicant is a full-time student, he or she has no more expertise than this Court to interpret the term \"attending\" with a view to decide whether the physical presence of a professor in a classroom is required or whether a student can be found to be in attendance if the course takes place through teleconference. In short, the issues to be looked at by the visa officer are issues of mixed fact and law. The relative expertise of the visa officer vis-à-vis this Court will therefore depend on the precise nature of his determination. As acknowledged by the Supreme Court in", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, \"the criteria of expertise and the nature of the problem are closely interrelated\". The officer's decision will therefore attract more deference if it essentially a fact-driven inquiry, whereas it will be given less deference if it is closer to a legal determination."], ["[17]", "Finally, the purpose of the provision that sets out the definition of a \"dependent child\" is to clarify who is a member of the family class and, in particular, under what circumstances children will be considered dependents for the purposes of the", "Act", ". The Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement to the", "Regulations", "states that the intent of the provisions relating to the family class is to ensure that:", "i. - the process and criteria by which members of the family class are selected are clear and transparent; this includes the requirements and obligations of sponsors;", "ii. - current social realities are taken into account in the defining of family class membership; and", "iii. - legislation is consistent with other legislation or principles to which Canada is committed."], ["[18]", "This is clearly not a case where the purpose of the statute must be conceived as granting rights as between the parties.

Having said this, Parliament has recognized that family reunification is one of the basis upon which permanent residents will be selected (", "IRPA", ", s. 12(1)), and Canadian citizens have been given the right to sponsor a foreign national who is a member of the family class. While the decision of an officer called upon to process an application for permanent residency may not be assimilated to a judicial process, premised on the bipolar opposition of two parties, it is not a balancing exercise between different constituencies either.

The applicants submit that the definition is silent with respect to what happens when an otherwise dependent child over the age of 22 marries and, accordingly, the only requirements that Rupinder was required to meet are having been enrolled in school and been actively pursuing courses on a full time basis."], ["[21]", "Unfortunately for the applicants, I do not think this interpretation is compatible with the wording of the definition. Contrary to the applicants' submission, I believe becoming a spouse or common law partner after turning 22 is a disqualifying characteristic.

An applicant must be either under 22 and not a spouse or common law partner, or, if the applicant has depended substantially on the support of the parent since before turning 22,", "or if the child became a spouse before the age of 22", ", since becoming a spouse, has been a full time student at an accredited institution, he or she may qualify as a dependent child. There is simply no category of dependency for a student who became a spouse after turning 22. Since great care has been taken in defining a \"dependent child\" for the purposes of the", "Regulations", "(and, by way of consequence, for the purposes of defining \"family member\" under the", "Act", ": see s. 1(3) of the", "Regulations", "), silence with respect to an individual who has married after turning 22 must be of consequence."], ["[23]", "If, as the applicants would have it, the only requirements for a person marrying after turning 22 were to have been financially dependent on his or her parents since before turning 22 and to have been a full time student at an accredited institution, it would render meaningless the restrictions with respect to marital status; the fact that one was married before the age of 22 would be irrelevant. Yet, the statute specifically sets out that a child who became a spouse or common law partner before turning 22 may qualify under this category if dependency continued. If, as the applicants suggest, the only determining characteristics under s. 2(b)(ii) are financial dependency and pursuit of studies, the Governor in Council would not have made specific reference to the particular category of married persons who may qualify - those who married before age 22."], ["[24]", "Indeed, the last part of s. 2(b)(ii) bears out this interpretation.

Either the child is not married, in which case he or she must have depended substantially on the financial support of the parent since before turning 22 (this is the first scenario), or the child is married, in which case he or she must have married before the age of 22 and have depended substantially on the financial support of the parent since marrying (this is the second scenario, between the two dashes). There is no other option."], ["[25]", "This interpretation is consistent with the French version of s. 2(b)(ii).

The applicants' response to this concern is two-fold. First, they contend there is a great deal of evidence that Rupinder has been attending classes at the school campus. Second, they submit the word \"attending\" should not be interpreted so narrowly as to exclude situations where students attend classes that are taught by videoconference."], ["[30]", "The applicants obviously have the burden of proving that Rupinder meets the definition of a \"dependent child\" and was \"attending\" a post-secondary program full-time. To this end, they submitted tuition receipts, transcripts and a letter from ICAI as evidence that she was enrolled full-time and was attending a post-secondary program full-time. It is also clear from the record that Rupinder and her parents live in the same municipality as the school she claims to have been attending. There is no evidence of any activity inconsistent with full time studies, such as full time work. Finally, the information taken from the ACAI's public website shows that the Mohali campus Rupinder says she is attending is on 36,000 square feet of land located in the heart of the city, and is the biggest institute in the region. There are even photographs of students sitting in classroom settings.

Mr. Glynn was unsure when they were made but confirmed that they pre-dated the 2005 acquisition. Mr. Glynn then introduced a number of physical items into the record, and explained their uses. Mr. Glynn took the Court through the items listed in a Dispill price list, explaining the intended uses for specific product components and accessories and who would use them (e.g., the pharmacist, nurses or non-professional staff of either the drug store or nursing home). Mr. Glynn went on to discuss the profit margin for various products, noting that the majority of Richards' sales are of consumables (blisters and labels) and that accessories are sold primarily to facilitate the consumable business. Sample labels were then introduced and described."], ["[62]", "Mr. Glynn explained that when Dispill Inc. commenced operations, it had an exclusive relationship with the pharmaceutical company Novopharm Quebec.

Mr. Glynn explained that the timing of the disclaimer was motivated by their review of the patent following receipt of Distrimedic's Statement of Claim and indicated that the intent of the disclaimer was to narrow the patent's application and to correct inadvertent errors or inadequate descriptions, both for the benefit of the litigation involving Distrimedic and to clarify the patent in connection with Richards' other competitors."], ["[65]", "Mr. Glynn went on to discuss the importance of the colours on the Dispill labels, explaining that they do two things: one is to \"sort of brand your product as recognizable\", the other is \"to facilitate the sort of use of the product\" (Transcript, March 25, at p 125). He noted that unless otherwise required by law, for example when issuing narcotics, Richards always uses the same colour scheme and is not aware of any other company using the same colours, apart from Distrimedic's brief use of them. Mr. Glynn indicated that the pharmacists do their own printing and that patients aren't likely to see a complete label. He then went on to discuss the products and colours employed by various Richards' competitors, specifically Jones and Manrex, and the advantages of the Richards solution over those other products (e.g., Richards' does not require a thermal seal), introducing samples along the way. He added that the Dispill system is a superior system to both Jones' and Manrex's systems due to its functionality and to the added safety of printing on the blister cell. Delivery of pills to patients takes less time with the Dispill system and the error rate is lower. Jones and Manrex have a small percentage of the market in Quebec, but they have a larger share of the overall Canadian marketplace. As for the other products on the market prior to Distrimedic's entrance, Mr. Glynn suggested they were alternate solutions to dispensing pills and not competing products."], ["[66]", "Mr. Glynn went on to discuss the various software companies and programs associated with Dispill Inc. at various points in time, including Kroll and DLD's Mentor program.

Screenshots from both DOS and Windows versions of the DLD software were reviewed, noting a hyperlink connected with Distrimedic's name in at least one version."], ["[67]", "Mr. Glynn confirmed that sales of consumables represent about 97-98% of Richards' business and noted that label sales exceed blister sales by approximately 20-25%, as more labels will be used if any changes are made. Financial documents demonstrating discounting, price decreases and rebates were also discussed. Mr. Glynn indicated that prices dropped by about 20% when Distrimedic entered the market in 2006. Correspondingly, the number of customers being offered discounts increased, even if the discounts offered did not change. Mr. Glynn indicated that rebates are offered in response to pricing pressures in the marketplace from Distrimedic. With the exception of the initial launch year by Distrimedic and the corresponding correction of the pricing, Richards' sales have been growing each year thereafter. If Distrimedic were not in the marketplace, Mr. Glynn believes that Richards would be able to increase its prices."], ["[68]", "In her cross-examination of Mr. Glynn (Glynn, March 26, at pp 45-153), Distrimedic's counsel touched on a variety of issues. Mr. Glynn confirmed that he is not involved in the day-to-day activities of the Dispill Division and spends \"very little\" of his overall time on that portion of Richards' business; he also admitted that he had no direct knowledge of the business of Dispill Inc. prior to Richards' July 2005 acquisition, apart from information disclosed to him as part of the due diligence that preceded the transaction."], ["[69]", "Counsel also questioned Mr. Glynn with respect to Richards' concurrent trade-mark application proceedings, Richards' specific trade-mark concerns (no claim in relation to Distrimedic's current colour use or name), the specifics of Richards' copyright claim (no claim in any software and no claim that Distrimedic used the software themselves but rather that they induced use on the part of pharmacists, admitting the DOS version likely hasn't been used since at least 2006), and Richards' relationship with the various software companies (including the ownership of the Dispill Label Form and payments for programming services or software licensing)."], ["[70]", "Mr. Glynn reiterated that the Dispill product has become an industry standard and has basically dominated the Quebec market. Counsel had Mr. Glynn clarify the circumstances surrounding the 2005 acquisition and intellectual property-related due diligence. He admitted that neither the Dispill Colour Scheme nor the Dispill Label Form were specifically discussed during the due diligence or specifically mentioned in the transaction agreements. He indicated, however, that the agreement between Richards and Dispill Inc. was meant to be all-inclusive such that all intellectual property held by Dispill Inc. would be transferred to Richards. In his view, although Schedule 5.1(ee) of the Share Purchase Agreement dated July 29, 2005 (JBD 244), which makes no mention of the Dispill Colour Scheme or Dispill Label Form, indicates that it is a list of all intellectual property, it was the seller's obligation to complete the list. To the extent that anything was missing from the seller's representation of its intellectual property, it would not affect Richards' right to acquire all of Dispill Inc.'s intellectual property."], ["[71]", "Counsel went on to question Mr. Glynn regarding the attribution of decreased pricing to Distrimedic's entry in the market, Richards' response to Distrimedic's entry (e.g., the notice sent to all pharmacist customers in September 2005 with respect to potential infringement of Dispill's patent, purportedly in response to confusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ' customer base and to dispel any confusion between Richards and Distrimedic), and the legality of the movement of employees from Dispill to Distrimedic."], ["[72]", "Finally, counsel had Mr. Glynn discuss the practical differences between the Dispill solution and solutions offered by competitors such as Jones and Manrex (e.g., with respect to sealing and printing labels, querying why although they are also authorizing pharmacists to print labels with similar information to Richards' they have not been sued), and the difference between the Dispill Label Form and the broader pharmacy software programs. At one point Mr. Glynn agreed that the copyright Richards is claiming is in the method of printing information onto individual cells, not on the top part of the container-sealing sheet. In other words, he suggested that the copyright that is claimed is the method of having individual cells that can be broken off while remaining sealed, with information displayed on the back of the cell so that it can be a stand alone product. He describes Richards' copyright as being identifiable on the basis of a two-part test: so long as the information appears on each cell and is substantially the same as what was selected as part of Richards' screenshots, copyright will be infringed. When pointed to a recently released Jones product incorporating printing on individual cells, Mr. Glynn indicated that Richards hadn't followed up on the details of the product and wasn't sure if it was infringing the patent, but, as far as his company was concerned, Jones was infringing the copyright by printing on the back of each cell of its solution, however the printed information is organized."], ["[73]", "With respect to patents, counsel for Distrimedic had Mr. Glynn confirm that accessories are not sold subject to any restriction regarding their use apart from the fact that they are patent-protected. He also confirmed that there is no allegation that Distrimedic is selling a knife or a cutting board. Reviewing Richards' reasons for filing the patent disclaimer, Mr. Glynn accepted that the last paragraph of the original Claim 15 stated that the holes were sized and positioned to correspond to and be engaged by said protuberances, and ultimately offered that he filed the disclaimer on the basis that \"the new description is a better description when read in combination with this than this alone\", presumably referring to the new and old wording (Transcript, March 26, at p 102). Despite acknowledging similarities between Claims 1 and 15 of the '045 Patent, Mr. Glynn had no answer as to why the disclaimer was not made to apply to Claim 1 as well as to Claim 15. He indicated that Richards did not speak to Mr. Bouthiette regarding the need for a disclaimer, that it was a mistake not to specify a reference to adhesive bands in the original patent, and that the language referring to engagement was \"not as descriptive as it should have been\" (Transcript, March 26, at p 104)."], ["[74]", "Upon being asked for some further clarification regarding the copyright infringement claim and the specific claims arising from or underlying \"Dispill's Label Form\", Mr. Glynn (referring to Exh. 164 and 165) claimed that initially there was no Distrimedic link in the Mentor software, so the printing of the Distrimedic label would be done by defaulting to the Dispill label. When a Distrimedic link was subsequently added to the software, Mr. Glynn agreed that \"the problem [Richards has] with Distrimedic, with respect to the copyright and the software is that they have -- Distrimedic has commissioned an application in the existing pharmacy software that allows the pharmacists to make the same selection of fields and print them onto a label ...on top of the cell\" (Transcript, March 26, at pp 122-123). Maintaining his position that Dispill offers a value-add over competitors' products in part due to the value of the associated intellectual property and in part due to ease of use, Mr. Glynn confirmed that Richards has \"the right to prevent anybody from using the Mentor program for purposes of printing onto a pill dispenser with the information on individual cells\" (Transcript, March 26, at p 126)."], ["[75]", "Mr. Glynn went on to discuss the Dispill target customers (pharmacists and nursing homes), factors affecting competition (nursing homes are more concerned with functionality and accuracy than with price) and pricing in the marketplace. Mr. Glynn repeated that Richards began increasing its rebates in 2006 and decreasing its prices in 2007 in response to Distrimedic coming into the market; Dispill had no competitor before Distrimedic, as Jones and Manrex were alternate solutions but were not offering the same kind of product. Mr. Glynn mentioned that the intellectual property owned by Dispill Inc. was not a factor in the negotiations leading to its purchase by Richards."], ["[76]", "In 2006, Richards removed the volume target necessary to obtain a rebate instead of lowering its prices as a means of appeasing certain customers without immediately offering a lower price to each customer. Before Distrimedic entered the market, few customers reached the volume targets and thus the number of rebates offered was small. Afterwards, the volume rebate percentage remained at approximately 7%, but the number of rebates increased because the number of customers who were offered discounts increased significantly in order to compete with Distrimedic's lower prices. In 2007, Richards was forced to drive down its prices due to competition by Distrimedic. The price (revenue per case unit) had dropped by approximately 20% by December 31, 2007. Outside of Quebec, however, pricing and discounting remained the same before and after Distrimedic's launch.", "ii. Marie-Josée Glaude"], ["[77]", "Marie-Josée Glaude, Vice-President of Sales and Trade Relations  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ' Retail Division and General Manager of Richards' Dispill Division in Montreal, was called to provide factual evidence and introduce various documents regarding Richards Packaging Inc., its relationship with various software companies, and pricing, including discounts offered in connection with Dispill products. Ms. Glaude was examined and cross-examined on March 26 and 27, 2013. She broadly confirmed Mr. Glynn's testimony with respect to pricing, adding that the pricing of Dispill products was dealt with on a case-by-case basis; the price was lowered if it made sense to do so in order to keep a customer. She provided numerous examples of Dispill customers consistently advising Dispill, after the entry of Distrimedic into the marketplace, that they could get the same product at a lower price from Distrimedic. She also referred to some emails and handwritten notes of employees of Richards tending to establish that some representatives of Distrimedic had used Dispill brochures to order Distrimedic products and suggesting that Dispill accessories can be used with Distrimedic products. When made aware of these practices in the fall of 2005, a Notice to Pharmacists was sent by mail stating that \"[i]t has come to our attention that certain persons without our authority have been promoting a product similar to DISPILL® or as a complete substitute for DISPILL®\". The letter went on to advise that such persons were not associated with DISPILL® or Richards Packaging and did not have any authority to sell the product or to represent themselves as associated with it. The letter indicated that any other product represented as related to DISPILL® would infringe Richards' trade-mark rights, that DISPILL® is protected by patent, that any use of components such as blister sheets or adhesive backing sheets purchased from sources not authorized by Richards to manufacture sets of individual pill containers would infringe its patented method for DISPILL®, and that any product that was a copy of or purported to be the same as DISPILL® would infringe Richards' patent rights in the product (Exh. 141 and 143)."], ["[78]", "I agree with counsel for the Defendants to the Counterclaim that Ms. Glaude is not a witness who can testify to the distinctiveness of the alleged trade-mark or to any instance of confusion or misrepresentation on the part of any of the Defendants to the Counterclaim without it being hearsay or speculation. Indeed, she admitted to not being in direct contact with Dispill's pharmacy customers and did not present any evidence to the effect that she is in contact with nursing homes. With respect to software issues, Ms. Glaude admitted to not being familiar with Mentor or the more modern versions of pharmacy software and indicated that she could not speak to the Dispill Label Form (JBD 149), which ceased being used prior to Richards' acquisition of Dispill Inc. For those reasons, I find that her testimony has little relevance on this point and should be given little weight."], ["[79]", "Moreover, certain documents relied upon by Ms. Glaude to bolster Richards' allegations of misrepresentations are not admissible because they contain hearsay.

The alleged event occurred between the representative of Distrimedic and the potential customer. The potential customer then allegedly communicated this event to two Dispill representatives who in turn allegedly communicated it to Fontaine who, according to Glaude, wrote the note.

Mr. Thibault was examined and cross-examined on March 27, 2013."], ["[90]", "In 2006, Mr. Thibault became aware of Distrimedic because he was looking for the best offer available for blister products. In the autumn of that year, Mr. Thibault met with a representative from Distrimedic, Mr. Paul van Gheluwe, in order to see whether Distrimedic could offer a better contract on blister products than Dispill was offering at the time. When Mr. Thibault considered switching from the Dispill product to the Distrimedic product, he was concerned with whether Distrimedic had the same or similar accessories as the Dispill system. He testified that the representative of Distrimedic presented accessories that could be used with the Distrimedic pill dispenser with the help of a catalogue. When Mr. Thibault, who at the time was very familiar with Richards' pill dispenser, asked if Distrimedic had accessories to use with their products, he was shown product sheets that were very similar to the sheets found in the Dispill catalogue shown to him as Exhibit 513, but without the word  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  on them. It was due to this similarity that he thought the two companies must have had the same external supplier."], ["[91]", "On cross-examination, Mr. Thibault testified that ease of use was his primary consideration in choosing a product. He also indicated that some information must be printed on a prescription drug, like the name of the patient, the name of the drug and its strength, its dosage and how it should be taken. Since such information is required by law, he would not be allowed to use a pill dispenser that did not allow for the inclusion of the required information."], ["[92]", "Mr. Thibault also mentioned that he was the one who contacted the representative from Distrimedic in 2006 to inquire about his product, after being told by colleagues that Distrimedic offered a similar product to Dispill at a lower price. When shown the Distrimedic price lists (JBD 27 and 34), he did not think that such price lists would have left him with the same impression of similarity to Dispill's catalogue as the lists he remembered viewing. Mr. Thibault also acknowledged, however, that when he met with the representative of Distrimedic, the representative did not try to mislead him into thinking that he was a Dispill representative or that he was selling Dispill products, and never falsely and misleadingly presented Distrimedic's products; it was clear to him at the time that they were two distinct companies."], ["[93]", "Counsel for the Plaintiff by Counterclaim argued that the Court ought to draw an adverse inference from the failure of the Defendants to the Counterclaim to call Mr. van Gheluwe in order to contradict any of Mr. Thibault's evidence. In response, counsel for the Defendants to the Counterclaim submitted that there was no reason to call Mr. van Gheluwe as a witness since there was no evidence of wrongdoing to be rebutted; indeed, Distrimedic's counsel are of the view that Mr. Thibault was a very credible witness, that he was the only one of Richards' witnesses in a position to give non-hearsay evidence of the misrepresentations or false statements allegedly made by Distrimedic, that he gave clear and precise answers and that the weight of his evidence should be considered high.

Following a two-year term instituted by a non-compete agreement, he started Distrimedic with Mr. Robert Poirier, with whom he controlled or directed each of the other corporate defendants (with Alpha and La Société amalgamating last year).

Each of these companies keep distinct and clearly separated financial records and account to one another for the value of shared resources. For example, there is only one payroll for all the employees of the three companies; La Société is responsible for paying all the employees and then invoices the other two companies for the amounts paid in salaries and commissions. Mr. Filiatrault also explained that rebates are sometimes given to a client of one company in recognition of the fact that it also purchases products of the two other companies, as a way to build loyalty."], ["[97]", "Mr. Filiatrault suggested that in recent years pharmacists have become more and more sophisticated as consumers and managers, that they share commercial information, and that those working for banners have commercial support from trained staff and even receive training in business negotiation. He also explained the roles of the banner corporations versus the franchised pharmacies in deciding which products are bought and at what price. He touched upon the early days of Dispill Inc. and its business relationship with Novopharm."], ["[98]", "Mr. Filiatrault mentioned that Dispill Inc.'s executives, at the time of marketing their product, never contemplated using the colour code as a trade-mark, but rather always viewed it as a safety feature of their products.

He testified that Bouthiette's nephew programmed the initial DOS software, and that some input was also received from pharmacist and software companies as to the selection of fields and operation of the DOS software. He then went through some of the computer software programs that had been used through the years to transfer the information about patients in the pharmacists' data banks to the Dispill label sheets. In this respect, he introduced into evidence two agreements, one between Dispill Inc. and DLD and the other between Dispill Inc. and InfoPharm, relating to the installation of the DOS software and the creation of a \"bridge\" from the DOS software to the DLD and InfoPharm platforms. To his knowledge, no copyright for these applications was ever registered."], ["[100]", "Mr. Filiatrault then went on to explain the circumstances surrounding the sale of his and Mr. Poirier's shares to Mr. Bouthiette, and the non-competition agreement clause whereby Mr. Filiatrault and Mr. Poirier agreed that they would not compete with Dispill for a two-year period beginning September 3, 2002. He stated that they never had any intention to breach that agreement. They also sought the opinion of legal counsel on the basis of the drawing of a new product to determine if they would be infringing the '045 Patent of Dispill Inc. According to that opinion dated March 5, 2003, their drawing would not infringe any of the claims found in the '045 Patent. They then sat on that project until the beginning of 2005, after having incorporated Distrimedic Inc. on September 7, 2004. It took most of 2005 to find a manufacturer and to obtain a good quality prototype of their new product that they would start showing to pharmacists in order to get their feedback. Distrimedic started selling its products in June of 2006. At the time, a box of 500 labels (container-sealing sheets) with 500 blisters (container-defining sheets) would sell for approximately $380.00, while the equivalent product from Dispill sold for approximately $460.00."], ["[101]", "Mr. Filiatrault introduced into evidence a document (JBD 549) compiling all the labels that have been used by Distrimedic since November 2005. He admitted that, in November and December of 2005, they printed a small quantity of container-sealing sheets using the same colour scheme as the Dispill Colour Scheme. Mr. Filiatrault stated that approximately 100,000 sheets with that colour scheme were printed, of which about 15 batches of 500 sheets were distributed for free to approximately 11 pharmacies for testing purposes. Mr. Filiatrault claimed that these sheets were later destroyed and were never used by pharmacists to sell to their clients. It should be noted that Distrimedic used the same product codes (ETCA-500 and ETCP-500) for labels incorporating, at different points in time, the allegedly infringing colour scheme and its current colour scheme."], ["[102]", "Mr. Filiatrault also mentioned that Distrimedic never used catalogues, but only price lists with illustrations of their products; they now use an internet website to show their products to pharmacists. He also insisted that he never told his clients that they could use Distrimedic products with Dispill accessories, because they had their own accessories and products that they wished to sell and because at least some of Dispill's accessories do not fit with Distrimedic products. He explained that some of Dispill's customers changed to Distrimedic because their products are more functional (claiming larger cells, more legible labels, more ergonomic trays), because of their customer service and because their prices were competitive. He added that a decision to change from one product to another is usually not made on the spur of the moment and may take days, if not weeks, depending on the decision-making process in each pharmacy and the amount of time required to acquire the new computer software.", "ii.

He also corroborated Mr. Filiatrault's testimony that Mr. Bouthiette's nephew programmed the DOS software used to print the information on the Dispill label sheets. He confirmed that Distrimedic distributed small quantities of the container-sealing sheets bearing Distrimedic's Original Colour Scheme as a prototype to no more than 15 of its client pharmacists; these sheets were later destroyed and were never used by pharmacists to sell to their clients."], ["[106]", "Mr. Poirier denied having misrepresented Distrimedic as being Dispill, or encouraged Dispill's clients to buy Distrimedic and use it with Dispill accessories.

The POSITA would also have knowledge of limitations associated with production and be familiar with industrial processes, including vacuum forming techniques."], ["[115]", "The '045 Patent contains 27 claims, namely Claims 1-14 and Claims 17-28. A disclaimer was filed in respect of Claims 15-21. Claims 1, 11, 15, 22, 26 and 28 are independent claims. The remainder are dependent claims."], ["[116]", "Claim 1 includes a recessed support, a container-defining sheet, a container-sealing sheet and a positioning means. With respect to the \"positioning means\", Mr. de Winter opines that the engagement of the protuberance and holes is particularly important with respect to the container-sealing sheet since the self-adhesive material on the bottom surface must be positioned, shaped and sized to fit over the flanges of the containers of the container-defining sheet. In addition, a positioning means that functionally permits the container-sealing sheet be in precise superposition (with very small tolerances) on top of the container-defining sheet which is an essential element of the invention. If it were not in precise superposition the container-sealing sheet would tear when individual cells were separated, limiting its desired use. The plastic and paper elements must be in the exact same position, allowing the user to bend it a few times and break it off. Mr. de Winter notes that the positioning means is referred to several times in the specification, including on page 3, line 13; page 9, lines 1-4; page 10, lines 8, 13 and 18; page 11, line 22; and page 15, line 22."], ["[117]", "Mr. de Winter further states that the engagement of the protuberance and hole prevents the container-sealing sheet from sliding horizontally (in 2 dimensions) up and down, sideways and at all other angles. This acts to hold the self-adhesive strips on the bottom of the container-sealing sheet in alignment with the flanges of the container-defining sheet so that the container-sealing sheet is ready to be applied to the container-defining sheet. Claim 1 refers to \"at least one other hole provided in the container-sealing sheet\"; however, no particular shape of the \"hole\" is specified. While the drawings in the '045 Patent show two round holes, the hole need not necessarily be round, as that shape would not serve the required purpose if only one round hole and one round protuberance were used; without additional support, the container-sealing sheet could rotate around the protuberance, which would not secure the bands of the container-sealing sheet in exact superposition on top of the flanges of the container-defining sheet."], ["[118]", "In order to be functional, the chosen protuberance must also have a certain shape and size to engage the hole. If it is too small, it may not retain the container-sealing sheet, as the tolerances of the container-sealing sheet positioned on the container-defining sheet would be too large. Since the paper is flexible, there must be enough contact with the protuberance to maintain the sheet in place. In Mr. de Winter's view, therefore, the words \"hole\" and \"protuberance\" should be understood in relation to their stated functions, i.e., protuberances extending above the recessed support and the container-defining sheet which engage an edge or edges of the container-defining sheet and the container-sealing sheet, preventing two-dimensional movement of the container-sealing sheet such that the bands of the container-sealing sheet are in exact superposition on top of the flanges of the container-defining sheet."], ["[119]", "With regards to Claim 2, Mr. de Winter explained that as with Claim 1, the container-sealing sheet would be rendered secure."], ["[120]", "With regards to Claim 3, Mr. de Winter opined that an essential function of the container-defining sheet was to be able to break it up into individual containers. This was best done on a practical basis if the breaking lines were straight in both directions. This in turn required the containers to be positioned in straight horizontal and straight vertical rows, as is the case with the Distrimedic pill dispenser."], ["[121]", "With regards to Claim 4, Mr. de Winter opined that printing appeared on the top surface of the container-sealing sheet of the Distrimedic pill dispenser, with the printing corresponding with each of the containers of the container-defining sheet and providing information about the material to be placed in each container."], ["[122]", "With regards to Claim 5, Mr. de Winter explained that the Distrimedic pill dispenser also had 28 recesses and corresponding containers in four columns and seven lines/rows."], ["[123]", "With regards to Claim 6, Mr. de Winter explained that the Richards pill sorter device has first and second stackable panels and all the features and functional characteristics described in Claim 6. In particular, it has a first panel in which the openings in the bottom wall of the half-bottomed recesses are positioned and shaped like the containers of the container-defining sheet. The set of half-bottomed recesses has a flat bottom wall that when stacked extends above the containers of the container-defining sheet. The bottom wall is sized to allow a pill to fall into the container below. It has a second panel containing hollow bottom recesses smaller than the half-bottomed recesses of the first panel and positioned to fit onto the half-bottomed recesses when the second panel is stacked and slid over such recesses in unison from the half-bottom recess to the opening in such recess, permitting pills to be placed in the half-bottomed recesses and dropped into the containers below."], ["[124]", "With regards to Claim 7, Mr. de Winter commented that the openings in the bottom wall of the half-bottomed recesses occupy about half of the surface area of said bottom wall and are on one side."], ["[125]", "With regards to Claim 8, Mr. de Winter commented that the Richards pill sorter has a first panel and second panel and contains all of the features essential to the operation of the kit described in Claims 6-9. Rivets are used and horizontal slots allow the second panel to slide horizontally with respect to the first panel."], ["[126]", "With regards to Claim 9, Mr. de Winter commented that according to Claim 1 only one protuberance and corresponding hole is required. Claim 9 refers to a particular configuration of the protuberances and the corresponding holes. In order for the kit to be functional, and in order to be a logically formed kit, the hole or holes and the protuberance or protuberances should be shaped and sized in such a way that fit exactly together to locate and stabilize each of the components in the proper position."], ["[127]", "With regards to Claim 10, Mr. de Winter commented that he read the word \"trough\" as being \"through\". Figure 12 of the '045 Patent identified this feature. This describes Richards' items 124 and 208, which contain all of the features described in this claim as being essential to the operation of the device."], ["[128]", "With respect to Claim 11, Mr. de Winter explained that he read the reference to \"contact sealing sheet\" as meaning \"container-sealing sheet\". Using the Distrimedic product in accordance with the procedure shown on the Distrimedic website would constitute the method described in this claim."], ["[129]", "On Claim 12, Mr. de Winter opined that the method shown on the Distrimedic website is the method described in Claim 12 as printing information on the sealing sheet as shown."], ["[130]", "With respect to Claim 13, Mr. de Winter explained that if the Richards pill sorter (JBD 20) were used with the appropriately same-sized Distrimedic pill dispenser, then the user would employ this particular method."], ["[131]", "With respect to Claim 14, Mr. de Winter explained that considering the function of the pill sorter, which is to check each individual pill before it is added to the already existing container, performance of the method of Claim 14 would be inevitable. The Richards pill sorter was used in exactly the same way."], ["[132]", "The two main problems that the patent seeks to solve are: (1) the alignment of the container-defining sheet with the container-sealing sheet, and (2) avoiding the use of thermosealing. In Mr. de Winter's view, the patent should be interpreted as follows in connection with the Richards and Distrimedic products."], ["[133]", "Having a dotted line punched, die-cut, on the flange of each container is essential to the design because it is necessary to detach the individual pill containers. There are a variety of options for such dotted lines, such as dots or slots. The number of perforations chosen by a manufacturer will determine how difficult it is for the containers to be separated. Bending the plastic material to tear it, without any perforations, would not be satisfactory as this might temporarily strengthen the plastic, leading to great difficulty in separating it. Detaching the container from the container-defining sheet has the effect of detaching it from adjacent containers."], ["[134]", "The term \"hole\" as used in the Patent should not be read literally as a complete circular hole (and there is no particular shape specified), but rather should be understood from a functional point of view in connection with aligning the container-sealing sheet in its proper position. Therefore, the \"hole\" need not necessarily be round. Page 15 of the Patent, for instance, also envisions other embodiments of the patented product beyond that used by the Dispill device."], ["[135]", "Mr. de Winter explained that in examining the functionality of the hole and protuberance in the Distrimedic device, one must consider the invention dynamically, as it would be used in practice, as opposed to statically, such as when the plastic blister sheet and label sheet have already been placed in the mounting tray. The two side tabs are very important in easily and quickly locating the plastic blister sheet, which is an important consideration to a pharmacist or other user who fills tens to hundreds of pill dispensers in any one given day. Although the plastic blister sheet is also located by the cavities which fit into the recesses on the mounting tray, that would not be an efficient way of locating the blister sheet. From a dynamic point of view, therefore, the two side tabs perform the same function as the hole and protuberance in the container-defining sheet in the Dispill device. Additionally, as previously described, the label sheet is located by abutting onto the raised protuberances or edges at the top of the Distrimedic mounting tray. One could say that, as in the claim, it \"corresponds to and engages the hole\". Thus, the raised edges perform the same function as the hole and protuberance in the container-sealing sheet in the Dispill device."], ["[136]", "The protuberances are essential for the positioning of the container-sealing sheet on the container-defining sheet because they form the connection between the two. The positioning is achieved using a combination of cavities in the container-defining sheets and the edges of the tabs on the container-defining sheet, which enables the container-defining sheet to be suspended. The container-sealing sheet must be slid into position, following which the self-adhesive protection sheet can be pulled off and glued to the container-defining sheet."], ["[137]", "The Distrimedic pill dispenser has a protuberance to engage the edges of the container-defining sheet and container-sealing sheet such that the container-sealing sheet does not move in two dimensions. According to Mr. de Winter, this pill dispenser works in the same way as the pill dispenser of the Patent; the difference in the protuberance used in the Distrimedic pill dispenser from the particular protuberances illustrated in the Patent does not have a material effect upon the way the pill dispenser works. The Distrimedic pill dispenser also has a horizontal strip removed from the bottom surface of the container-sealing sheet exposing a self-adhesive strip to attach to the top surface of the container-defining sheet to supplement the prevention of movement and, additionally, to stabilize it in a third (vertical) dimension. Mr. de Winter is therefore of the opinion that the Distrimedic pill dispenser provides the same function as set out in Claim 1 and that, in view of the lack of specific description of shape and size of both the protuberance and the corresponding hole in Claim 1 of the Patent, it does it in the same way."], ["[138]", "Finally, in Mr. de Winter's opinion, the Braverman Patent does not disclose how to perform or make what is disclaimed and claimed as the invention in the '045 Patent. In his opinion, as of June 21, 1997, the Braverman Patent would have been given very little weight when considering how to obtain a result of the nature described and claimed in the Patent in the relevant field."], ["[139]", "The Braverman Patent includes spring-loaded pins and a pressure-applying member. The claims in columns 5 and 6 of that patent do not reference the pins as part of the invention claimed. Mr. de Winter noted that in column 4 there appear to be some errors regarding the numbers in the drawing, which correspond to the spring-loaded pins."], ["[140]", "Mr. de Winter explained that the spring-loaded pins are not used to secure or align the container-sealing sheet to the container-defining sheet in the Braverman Patent, and trial and error would not lead to any such conclusion. In his view, they are simply used to push back the weight that is being applied to the self-adhesive. A pin would, to a person with a mechanical mind, convey the message that it is to push back something because that is what such a pin is usually used for. According to Mr. de Winter, this is confirmed twice in the Braverman Patent, as Braverman twice states that the function of the pins is to eject the pressure-applying member."], ["[141]", "The pressure-applying member does not serve to align the container-sealing sheet; instead, it serves the function of the roller used with the Distrimedic product, i.e., it further presses the container-sealing sheet onto the container-defining sheet. The spring-loaded pins are properly described as guiding the sheet into the desired position, but do not locate the sheet. A person locates the sheet by holding it by hand through a nipped corner. In addition, Column 4, line 45, refers to a liner strip covering the nipped corner, which suggested to Mr. de Winter that the sheet would be held with a finger since the nipped corner is diagonally opposite to the pins, reinforcing his opinion that the pins do not hold the sheet in place."], ["[142]", "Mr. de Winter concluded that a POSITA would not be led directly and without difficulty to the invention in the claims of the Patent and a POSITA would not be motivated to try such in view of the Braverman Patent. On a view of the whole '045 Patent, it was not something that would be obvious, nor would the improvements from the Braverman Patent to the '045 Patent be obvious. The Braverman Patent is focused on keeping three of the corners in place in order to peel back the sheet. In reconstructing the position of a POSITA for the particular technology, it would not be obvious to that person, on looking at the Braverman Patent, that the key missing part of the invention was the lack of an ability to locate the container-sealing sheet.", "ii.

Paragraphs 24-27 of his affidavit referenced an additional item: time of day. Twelve of these fifteen items were present in the DLD Mentor program as fields available to be entered. He could not verify whether this was also the case for the remaining three items (file no., pharmacist name, pharmacist address/phone); however, he indicated it is possible these are entered during installation of the program at a given pharmacy. Thus, he concluded that the elements of the Dispill Label Form continued in the Windows version."], ["[147]", "Although there are significant differences in the \"look\" of the screens of the DOS program and the \"look\" of the windows of the Mentor programs, these differences are expected because of the different user interfaces employed by the two operating systems (character-based for DOS versus graphics-based for Windows).

This makes the layout and format of the Dispill and Distrimedic label sheets substantially similar. Therefore, Dr. Abdelrahman concluded that one of three outcomes is likely to occur: (1) the instructions of the program module that execute when the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  submenu is selected have been updated to reflect the change from A4 to 8.5\" x 11\"; (2) the program module that executes when the \"Dispill Laser\" submenu is selected is made to execute when the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  submenu is selected; or (3) the selection of the \"Dispill Laser\" submenu is used to print the 8.5\" x 11\" Distrimedic label sheet.

When Distrimedic entered the market, it is alleged that it was offering a patent-infringing product at a lower price. It is alleged that Distrimedic's lower price created a competitive imperative for Richards to reduce its prices in Quebec. It is this reduced price that forms the basis for the claimed loss of income. Since the information necessary to appropriately review and quantify Richards' alleged loss of customers to Distrimedic was not available, Mr. McAuley did not estimate that head of loss of income. He did, however, prepare an estimate of the profit that Distrimedic earned on the sale of labels, as this would provide an estimate of Richards' losses under copyright law."], ["[163]", "In calculating the loss of past income due to price suppression, KPMG compared Richards' prices, net of rebates, to those of Distrimedic. Prior to Distrimedic's entry into the market, Richards' net unit prices were in the range of $260 and $183 for blisters and labels, respectively. Richards' net prices began to decrease in 2006 after Distrimedic entered the market with estimated net unit prices of about $174 and $56 for blisters and labels, respectively."], ["[164]", "In estimating the loss due to reduced unit prices, Mr. McAuley calculated Richards' actual average unit price prior to any rebates in Quebec by dividing the total annual gross sales for blisters and labels in Quebec by the number of units of each sold in Quebec each year. Assuming that, but for Distrimedic's entry in the market, the average selling price in Quebec would have mirrored the selling price in the territories other than Quebec, Mr. McAuley adopted the average selling price in the other territories as the assumed or expected unit price that Richards would have used in Quebec. The difference between the actual unit price and the assumed/ expected unit price had Distrimedic not been in the market represents the estimated unit price reduction in each year. To calculate the total loss due to reduced prices each year, the unit price reduction is multiplied by the actual number of units sold in each year. Mr. McAuley's calculations show that Richards' actual average unit price of blisters and labels in Quebec began decreasing in 2006."], ["[165]", "Increased sales by reason of diminution of price is also a factor that must be taken into account in a price suppression analysis. Mr. McAuley considered in his analysis the possibility that Dispill's increase in sales from 2008 to 2009 would have been due to the lower price offered by Dispill for its pill dispenser, but explained that the sales volume history did not show that type of price sensitivity in the market and attributed the growth to sales effort, penetration and marketing by Dispill."], ["[166]", "Mr. McAuley assumed that but for Distrimedic's entry into the market, the average rebate per unit in Quebec would have remained at the same level it was at in Quebec in 2005, prior to Distrimedic's entrance into the market. Using this approach, he calculated that the total loss of income (up to December 31, 2010) is between $6,112,100 and $6,594,500. He added that this loss would have continued for two more years, to 2013, and using the loss for the year 2010 as a proxy for the years 2011 and 2012 (an incremental loss of approximately $1.6 million), this would bring Richards' total loss close to $10 million."], ["[167]", "With respect to an accounting of Distrimedic's profits for the purpose of calculating the damages under the alleged copyright infringement, Mr. McAuley employed the differential cost approach, which involves calculating the contribution margin by deducting the estimated variable costs related to labels from the revenue from labels, net of sales discounts."], ["[168]", "The Defendants to the Counterclaim submit that Distrimedic is effectively a \"one-product company\", the argument being that if they had not sold the labels, they would not have sold blisters, with the two products constituting the majority of all sales. Thus, the approach taken by the expert called by Distrimedic on this question was to take Distrimedic's net income and divide it among blisters (44.29%) and labels (55.71%) to arrive at the profits made from labels. As a result of a \"hot-tubbing\" exercise involving Mr. McAuley and Distrimedic's expert, Mr. Levi, Mr. McAuley was satisfied with using this approach so long as an adjustment was made for three types of costs that, in his opinion, should not be deductible in this case: i) income taxes; ii) professional fees; and iii) market development costs related to Europe. On that basis, Mr. McAuley arrived at an amount of $552,972 as Distrimedic's total profit for labels."], ["[169]", "In addition to the accounting for profits, the remedy under s. 35 of the", "Copyright Act", ", RSC 1985, c C-42 (as amended by the", "Copyright Modernization Act", ", SC 2012, c 20) allows recovery of financial loss where a plaintiff is forced to reduce the price of its product to compete. According to Mr. McAuley, the total loss due to price suppression for labels, already calculated under patent infringement, would amount to $2,707,372 (low estimate) or $2,938,332 (high estimate). He also explained that this calculation was made to December 31, 2010, and that this loss would have continued for two more years. Using the loss for the year 2010 as a proxy for the years 2011 and 2012 (an incremental loss of approximately $712,000), this would bring Richards' total loss close to $4.1 million."], ["[170]", "Finally, Mr. McAuley calculated the loss related to the alleged trade-mark passing off. The total estimated gross revenue of the labels allegedly subject to the trade-mark passing off is $62,000.

In his view, nothing in the '045 Patent suggests that the inventor did not consider the positioning means provided on the container-defining sheet and on the container-sealing sheet to be essential elements.

The container-sealing sheet and the container-defining sheet are aligned and fixed together in a manner that is materially different from that described and claimed in the '045 Patent.

It employs a tray with recesses, which receives and holds a container-defining sheet with corresponding cavities.

It appears that the new product line quickly took over the majority of Richards' sales of the products in issue. According to Mr. Levi, it is not proper to group both product lines together for purposes of determining Richards' alleged losses based on price reductions, as was done by Mr. McAuley. In his view, it is only necessary to look at those products that existed at the time that Distrimedic entered the market to determine the impact of reduced pricing for sales due to Distrimedic's entry into the market."], ["[188]", "Mr. Levi also questions one of the assumptions made by Mr. McAuley, that the market in Quebec would mirror the market in territories outside of Quebec. In Mr. Levi's view, such an assumption ignores the possible impact of legislation introduced in Quebec in 2005 and 2006 to limit rebates and other benefits that could be offered to pharmacists in connection with pharmaceuticals. The impact of the reduction of benefits offered to pharmacists in Quebec (previously as high as 50%, now restricted to 20%) was substantial, and would necessarily lead pharmacists to press for bigger profit margins from other products to make up the difference."], ["[189]", "Mr. Levi also disagrees with another assumption used by Mr. McAuley, namely that, but for Distrimedic's entry into the market, Richards' average selling prices for blisters and labels in Quebec would have increased or decreased at the same rate as those outside Quebec. Mr. Levi points out that Richards' sales in Quebec have always been much higher than outside Quebec, and that Richards' sales in Quebec grew at a healthy pace during the period in question despite competition from Distrimedic."], ["[190]", "Another source of debate between Mr. Levi and Mr. McAuley is with regard to the treatment of volume discounts as rebates for the purpose of calculating the amount of price suppression. Mr. McAuley treats all discounts as rebates, whether they are volume discounts, promotional prices or other types of rebates. Mr. Levi notes in his Revised April 19, 2013 Report that the McAuley Report makes no reference to volume discounts, and includes those discounts in his calculations. As he explained during his testimony, sales using the basic product codes, those without the *ESC or *PR suffix, appear to reflect Richards' price list. The *ESC suffix appears to reflect volume discounts, and the *PR suffix appears to reflect a promotional price that was offered only in Quebec. In Mr. Levi's view, volume discounts and discounts for purchase of other products such as vials (reflected by product codes with a *ESC suffix) are not related to competition from Distrimedic and, therefore, should not be considered in calculating any loss of income Richards may have suffered due to Distrimedic's entry into the market. In his report, Mr. Levi applies these same assumptions to calculate the alleged loss of future income."], ["[191]", "Mr. Levi also disagrees with Mr. McAulay's assessment of Distrimedic's profits from the sales of its labels. He points out that Distrimedic is a single-product company whose product involves both blisters and labels, and that the company cannot sell one consumable without the other. All expenses of the company are relevant to its revenues, and therefore all of its expenses should be considered when calculating profits. Mr. Levi calculated profits related to labels by taking Distrimedic's cumulative profits that relate to labels as a fraction of its total profits, i.e., 55.71% of about $116,000, yielding a figure of about $64,000. This figure was later raised to about $85,000 after the two experts met."], ["[192]", "Finally, Mr. Levi assessed the alleged loss of past and future income on the new product line applying the same methodology.

A purposive construction should obviously focus on the wording of a claim, obviously, but this is a far cry from saying that nothing else should be considered."], ["[211]", "Be that as it may, counsel for Richards do not dispute that the protuberances and the holes are an important element of the '045 Patent, but they counter (relying on Mr. de Winter's expert evidence) that the term \"hole\" as used in the Patent should not be read literally as a complete circular hole but rather should be understood from a functional point of view of aligning the container-sealing sheet in its proper position. As he wrote at paragraph 14 of his first affidavit:", "In order to be functional, the chosen protuberance must also be given a certain shape and size to engage the hole. If it is too small, it may not retain the container-sealing sheet as the tolerances of the container-sealing sheet positioned on the container-defining sheet would be too large. Since the paper is flexible, there must be enough contact to maintain the sheet in place. Thus, in my opinion, the words \"hole\" and \"protuberance\" should be understood in relation to their stated functions, i.e. protuberances extending above the recessed support and the container-defining sheet which engage an edge or edges of the container-defining sheet and the container-sealing sheet preventing two-dimensional movement of the container-sealing sheet such that the bands of the container-sealing sheet are in exact superposition on top of the flanges of the container-defining sheet. (de Winter, September 30, 2010, at para 14)"], ["[212]", "With all due respect, this definition of a \"hole\" strains the imagination and stretches the ordinary interpretation of that word beyond what is acceptable. As stated by Mr. Mauffette in his expert report, [and as a POSITA might reasonably conclude, in the context of this patent,] for a hole to exist there must be an empty space with material around it. It appears that Mr. de Winter improperly focused on the positioning means defined elsewhere in the claims, without giving proper attention to the use of the word \"hole\" therein. One cannot do away with the concept of a hole in interpreting the independent claims. Had these claims not referred to holes and protuberances, then they could have been interpreted as if holes and protuberances were not the only way that positioning could be achieved. Indeed, it is quite telling that the only alternative to the positioning means described in the '045 Patent (above, at para 30 of these reasons) still refers to holes and protuberances, the only difference being that they are arranged differently to achieve the necessary alignment."], ["[213]", "Mr. de Winter indicated that he was driven to construe the word \"hole\" broadly because the '045 Patent does not explicitly exclude the use of a single round hole. He reasoned that the inventor must have contemplated non-round holes. Up to this point, this is a fair assumption. However, based on this contemplation of non-round holes, Mr. de Winter then took the unwarranted leap of concluding that the invention must have been intended to encompass devices that are not typical holes but that perform the same positioning function. In Mr. de Winter's view, this reasoning supports his opinion that a raised wall should be considered equivalent to a partial hole since it would perform the same function as two separate protuberances and holes."], ["[214]", "Once again, I agree with counsel for Distrimedic that such a construction of a \"hole\" is unwarranted, and Mr. de Winter himself acknowledged that he was stretching the definition of hole. He went as far as saying that he chose to focus more on the function of a hole than on the concept of a hole itself (Transcript, April 2, at pp 172-173). This is clearly inconsistent with the principles governing the construction of claims: while claims are to be construed in a purposive manner, their language must still be adhered to. A hole, at least in the context of this patent, does not have an unconventional or exceptional meaning, and there is nothing in the Patent indicating that a particular skill set is required to understand what is meant by the description of the positioning means."], ["[215]", "For all the above reasons, the interpretation of the '045 Patent, and in particular of the positioning means, put forward by counsel for Richards must be rejected. The words of the '045 Patent are plain and unambiguous and do not, on their face, raise great subtleties of interpretation. Accordingly, the words \"hole\" and \"protuberance\" must bear their ordinary meaning. A hole cannot encompass anything that performs the aligning function of a hole, and there is no basis in the language of the '045 Patent for the proposition that a hole could be the edge of a sheet abutting a protuberance.

Evidence of such instructions must be conclusive. Completion of the infringing act must occur as a result of the influence of the direct infringer and there must be evidence of such influence (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ])."], ["[220]", "In their submissions, counsel for Richards argued that the Distrimedic pill dispenser borrows a number of essential elements from the '045 Patent.

They also mentioned the dotted line (die-cut) punched in the container-sealing sheet as another important feature or even essential element of that product. I do not, however, need to make any findings with respect to those alleged similarities in light of the fact that counsel for Distrimedic have chosen to focus their non-infringement argument on other essential elements of the claims. As previously mentioned, it is sufficient for the Defendants to the Counterclaim to establish that at least one essential element of each of the claims of the '045 Patent is not present in the Distrimedic system to avoid a finding of infringement (", "Free World Trust", ", above, at para 31)."], ["[221]", "A key feature of each of Claims 1 to 25 is the \"positioning means provided on at least the top surface of the container-defining sheet and on the container-sealing sheet\". Counsel for Distrimedic argues that the Distrimedic system does away with this feature at least because the container-defining sheet does not have positioning means on its top surface. I agree with Mr. Mauffette that the container-defining sheet of the Distrimedic system is kept in position by the snug fit of its cavities in the recesses of the tray. Neither the edge, nor any other part of the container-sealing sheet of the Distrimedic system engages any protuberance or raised portion of the tray."], ["[222]", "There was a lot of discussion about the proximity of the top of the container-defining sheet and the protruding zone of the support tray. They are indeed close, but there does not appear to be any functional reason why they need to be. It would arguably make it more difficult to fit the container-defining sheet on the tray if the top of the sheet or the two side tabs were to touch the vertical protruding zone of the tray. Even if I were prepared to accept, however, that the two side tabs on the container-defining sheet somehow help to align that sheet against the raised vertical edges of the mounting tray, another key element would still be missing. Claims 1 to 14 and 22 to 25 (claims 15 to 21 were subject to a disclaimer and are addressed below), specify that:", "the positioning means comprises at least one upwardly projecting protuberance provided on the top surface of the recessed support, at least one hole provided into the container-defining sheet and at least one other hole provided in the container-sealing sheet, said at least one hole and one other hole being sized and positioned to correspond to and be engaged by said protuberance."], ["[223]", "Neither the container-defining sheet nor the container-sealing sheet of the Distrimedic system has any holes. Moreover, the recessed support of the Distrimedic system does not include any upwardly projecting protuberance to correspond to and be engaged by any holes. The container-sealing sheet and the container-defining sheet are aligned and fixed together in a manner that is materially different from that described and claimed in the '045 Patent."], ["[224]", "Counsel for Richards argued that from a dynamic point of view, the two side tabs perform the same function as the holes and protuberances of the Dispill device. They also suggested that locating the label sheet by abutting it against the raised protuberances or edges at the top of the Distrimedic mounting tray is equivalent to and corresponds with engaging the hole as in the claims. In their submission, therefore, the raised edges perform the same function as the holes in the container-defining and container-sealing sheets and the protuberance in the recessed support in the patent."], ["[225]", "I have already indicated, in the previous section dealing with the construction of the '045 Patent, that such a convoluted reading of the Patent ought to be rejected for a number of reasons.

Richards does not allege direct infringement of these claims, since there is no evidence or argument that the Distrimedic system incorporates any device similar to those claimed in the '045 Patent. Rather, Richards claim that Distrimedic induced infringement of these claims by pharmacists. This argument, which Richards' counsel did not vigorously advance cannot succeed. Quite apart from the fact that these two devices don't appear to work properly with the Distrimedic system, purchasers of such devices from Richards must be presumed to have acquired an implicit right to use them without restriction (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 100;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), at para 20).

There can be no inducement to infringe on this basis not least because the first element of the three-part test (an act of infringement by the direct infringer) is not satisfied. Moreover, Richards has adduced no admissible evidence regarding the second element of the test for inducing infringement, i.e., that any infringing act by a user of the devices in question was influenced by Distrimedic such that, without this influence, the infringing act would not have taken place. Accordingly, there is no infringement of any claim that includes the pill-sorting device or the device for opening a set of pill containers with a knife on the basis alleged."], ["[228]", "Finally, though many of the trays sold as part of the Distrimedic system incorporate \"a number of recesses at least equal to the number of cavities embossed in the container-defining sheet\" (defined in Claims 1 to 25), two of them (Exh. 543 and 544) do not incorporate this feature. The first two rows of recesses are evenly spaced and intended to receive cavities of container-defining sheets, similar to other Distrimedic trays, but the remaining recesses are different. Moreover, these trays also do not infringe Claims 5 and 19 for the additional reason that they do not comprise 28 recesses."], ["[229]", "Having found that Distrimedic has not infringed the '045 Patent, it is not strictly necessary for me to address the next two questions identified by the Prothonotary with respect to patent law.

The Disclaimer"], ["[230]", "As previously mentioned, Richards filed a disclaimer in respect of Claims 15 to 21 of the '045 Patent.

The changes in Claim 15 resulting from the disclaimer are found in paragraph 43 of these reasons."], ["[231]", "A disclaimer is a significant, formal and public act filed at the Patent Office. It is a mechanism that, when filed in the prescribed form and manner, is used by patentees to disclaim part of their patent when, by mistake, accident or inadvertence, and without wilful intent to defraud or mislead the public, the patentee has done one of two things: a) framed his patent too broadly, or b) incorrectly claimed to be the inventor of any material or substantial part of the patent to which he had no lawful right (or incorrectly claimed some other person as the inventor thereof) (", "Patent Act", ", s. 48(1))."], ["[232]", "A disclaimer must be filed in the prescribed form and manner:", "Patent Act", ", s. 48(2).

Either the patentee disclaims the entirety of a claim or the entirety of a claim with the exception of listed elements of that claim. The expression \"...with the exception of the following ...\" used in item 3(2) of Form 2 makes it clear that a disclaimer is essentially a negative allegation, and it is clearly not to be used as a device for reformulating or redefining the invention disclosed and claimed."], ["[233]", "Patents are presumed to be valid pursuant to s. 43(2) of the", "Patent Act", ", but this presumption does not extend to disclaimers (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [", "Sanofi-Aventis", "]).

This is precisely what this Court and the Court of Appeal reiterated when they set aside, on judicial review, the Commissioner's decision refusing to record the disclaimer because it attempted to broaden, rather than narrow, the scope of at least one claim (see paras 44 to 50 of these reasons). When a disclaimer is contested, its validity must be proven, and it is for the Court to determine whether the patentee made the disclaimer in good faith and not for an improper purpose.

Moreover, according to the case law, the validity of the disclaimer depends on the \"state of mind\" of the patentee at the time he made his specification. The patentee must be able to demonstrate to the Court that the disclaimer is made in good faith and not for an improper purpose.

While this chronology is obviously not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish bad faith, it is certainly a contextual element that can be considered in determining what prompted the filing of a disclaimer."], ["[235]", "Richards' attempt at an explanation for the portion of the disclaimer concerning replacement of the word \"hole\" with \"engaging means\" was both unconvincing and inadequate. According to Mr. Glynn, Richards' concern was that there wasn't \"a proper description around the holes being engaging means grabbing the protuberance\" (Transcript, March 25, at p 123). However, the disclaimed claim, in its original form, already defined the holes as \"being sized and positioned to correspond to and be engaged by said protuberance\". It may be, as Mr. Glynn added, that the new description is a better description of the positioning means, but this is insufficient to constitute a mistake, accident or inadvertence for the purposes of establishing the validity of a disclaimer."], ["[236]", "Moreover, neither the inventor, Bouthiette, nor anyone else involved in the original patent application was ever consulted about the disclaimer. Again, while this is not determinative in determining whether a disclaimer has been filed for an improper purpose, it is nevertheless a relevant indicia to consider, especially when the inventor is available and easily reachable as was attested to here."], ["[237]", "Finally, one cannot help but wonder why Claim 1, which has virtually identical language to that disclaimed in Claim 15, was not similarly disclaimed. When questioned on that point, Mr. Glynn could give no explanation. If there had been a genuine mistake, accident or inadvertence which prompted the filing of the disclaimer, other claims using identical language should logically have been amended as well."], ["[238]", "The substance of the disclaimer is equally problematic, as it clearly broadens the scope of the patent instead of narrowing it. As indicated above, a key change made through the disclaimer was changing the language of \"at least one hole\" to \"engaging means\" and \"at least one other hole\" to \"other engaging means\". A hole is undoubtedly an engaging means, but engaging means is not limited to a hole. It could include, for example, a depression or a recess."], ["[239]", "Bearing in mind that the validity of the disclaimer is the subject of an application for judicial review, I shall refrain from ruling definitively on the issue. My comments on this subject are only meant to be an additional reason for concluding that the Defendants to the Counterclaim have not infringed the '045 Patent. That being said, I cannot agree with counsel for Distrimedic that the original patent should be invalidated, on the basis that it is tainted by the admission made by Richards that the disclaimed claims in their original form were too broad. I cannot accept this argument in the case at bar. The reasoning advanced by the Defendants to the Counterclaim would hold true if the disclaimed claims in their original form were indeed too broad. However, quite to the contrary, it is the disclaimer that would impermissibly broaden the scope of the claim. I appreciate that Richards, by filing the disclaimer, conceded that their original patent was too broad in scope. There is, however, no independent evidence to that effect, and the Defendants to the Counterclaim have not submitted any arguments in support of their claim that the original patent is overbroad. Contrary to the hypothetical example given by Justice Martineau in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 49, where he assumes that a line can clearly be drawn between the scope of the original claim and the more limited scope of the disclaimed claim, there is no such clear line in the present case.

While it cannot be denied that the spring-loaded pins help in guiding the container-sealing sheet, as Mr. de Winter admitted, they do not locate the sheet in the sense of keeping it in position.

Spring loaded pins are expensive, particularly as a stainless steel mounting tray would require stainless steel pins; if their function was purely to locate the container-sealing sheet, they could have been replaced by plastic molding components. Furthermore, the Braverman Patent twice mentions that the function of the pins is to eject the pressure applying member, which is consistent with the normal use of such pins and is typical in molding, stamping, and tooling. Finally, it appears that the sheet is aligned by a person holding it by hand through the nipped corner diagonally opposite to the pins, reinforcing the view that the pins are not meant to hold the sheet in place."], ["[256]", "In light of the above, I accept Mr. de Winter's assessment that the invention described in the '045 Patent was neither obvious nor anticipated. The Braverman Patent does not provide disclosure of how to perform or make what is disclosed and claimed as the invention in the '045 Patent. To borrow from the language of Justice Hugessen in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Braverman Patent does not provide \"all the information which, for practical purposes, is needed to produce the claimed invention without exercise of any inventive skill\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at 297). The upwardly projecting protuberances and the holes as a means of positioning the container-sealing sheet over the container-defining sheet were not obvious either, in light of the common general knowledge as of July 22, 1996. The Braverman Patent may have triggered an inventor to think of a new (and equally inventive) concept, but this is insufficient to render the later idea obvious."], ["[257]", "This finding is consistent with my earlier determination that the disclaimer is invalid. As previously mentioned, the paragraph defining the \"at least one upwardly projecting protuberance\" and the holes was added to Claim 15 by the applicant (Richards' predecessor) in order to overcome a rejection of the previous wording of the claim by the Patent Office. This essential element is clearly the innovative element of the claim. Replacing the terms \"at least one hole\" and \"at least one other hole\" by \"engaging means\" and \"other engaging means\" would clearly broaden the scope of the claim since it would no longer be limited to a system in which the container-sealing sheet is aligned with the container-defining sheet by way of the engagement of holes in each with at least one corresponding upwardly projecting protuberance in the recessed support. By invalidating the disclaimer and upholding the validity of the '045 Patent in its original form, its newness or inventiveness would therefore be preserved.", "b) Misrepresentation"], ["[258]", "As noted above, Prothonotary Morneau framed the issue related to misrepresentation as follows: \"Whether the defendants to the counterclaim have made false and misleading statements that tended to discredit the business, services and wares of Richards.\""], ["[259]", "Subsection 52(1) of the", "Competition Act", "provides that no person shall knowingly or recklessly make a representation to the public that is false or misleading in a material respect for the purpose of promoting the supply or use of a product or for the purpose of promoting any business interest.

Counsel made much of the fact that during that meeting, Mr. Thibault remembers having been shown product sheets that he found to be very similar to the Dispill catalogue, to such an extent that he was under the impression that the two companies must have had the same external supplier.

I appreciate that such a representation, had it been substantiated, would have been quite material considering that the availability of similar accessories to those offered with the Dispill system was a key factor in Mr. Thibault's decision to switch from the Dispill system to the Distrimedic system.

Filiatrault and Poirier denied misrepresenting themselves as being Dispill, or encouraging their clients to buy Distrimedic and use it with Dispill accessories, and they provided credible explanations as to why they would not have done that.

During their examination and cross-examination, they both came across as forthcoming and truthful in their answers, and their credibility was not impugned or undermined in any respect. For that reason, I am inclined to give much weight to their evidence and to find it reliable."], ["[267]", "Finally, a close reading of Mr. Thibault's cross-examination reveals that he is the one who initiated contact with Distrimedic, that he was never presented with the Dispill catalogue, that the product sheets did not bear the name  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and that he only drew the conclusion that the Distrimedic products were made by the same external supplier as the Dispill products because they looked much the same.

While his evidence (and in particular his cross-examination) could have been helpful in ascertaining what really took place when he met Mr. Thibault in 2006, I am not prepared to draw a negative inference from the strategic decision made by counsel for Distrimedic not to call him, as there is no evidence of wrongdoing to be rebutted."], ["[269]", "In fact, the same criticism can be levelled against the conscious decision of Richards not to present any other pharmacists to whom misrepresentations were allegedly made. Instead, Richards presented a few emails and handwritten notes of its employees to whom instances of misrepresentation by Distrimedic were allegedly reported. The authors of such handwritten notes and emails did not testify at trial to establish what exactly was said to them, and by whom, and Distrimedic therefore had no opportunity to cross-examine them. Even if the authors had testified at trial, they are clearly not the individuals to whom the alleged false and misleading statements were made. Indeed, these emails and written notes are simply Richards employees to whom clients (mostly pharmacists) have reported conversations with Distrimedic representatives.

In coming to this conclusion, I bear in mind that the purchasers of the Dispill and Distrimedic products are sophisticated purchasers unlikely to be easily influenced or mislead; the decision to adopt one kind of pill dispenser instead of another is most often taken by medical professionals and more than one person whether in the context of pharmacies or nursing homes, and it is in that context that the general impression of the advertisement or of the representations has been assessed."], ["[271]", "For all of the foregoing reasons, I find that the allegations of misrepresentation have not been made out.

In coming to this conclusion, the Supreme Court reiterated that a mark that goes beyond distinguishing the wares of its owner to protect the functional structure of the wares themselves is transgressing the legitimate bounds of a trade-mark. It would indeed be a perversion of trade-mark law to grant trade-mark protection to a mark that has a primarily functional use, as it would provide something which a patent for the same product could not provide because patent protection cannot be perpetual.

Thus a distinguishing guise which is primarily functional provides no rights to exclusive use and hence no trade-mark protection.

Autonomous patients may be given the individual small blister at the appropriate time of the day, but they generally will not see the pill dispenser in its complete form and thus rarely come into contact with the complete Dispill Colour Scheme. Patients are therefore not the relevant customers of the Dispill and Distrimedic products when it comes to determining whether the alleged trade-mark is distinctive.

The same is not necessarily true of other pharmaceutical paraphernalia, the main characteristic of which may not be their effectiveness to treat or cure a medical condition and whose appearance may be more relevant in helping the customer to choose the products of one manufacturer in preference to another.

Contravention of paragraph 7(b) hinges on the proof of confusion in connection with a trade-mark, which in turn stems from the \"use\" by a defendant of a trade-mark within the meaning of section 4 of the", "Trade-marks Act", ": see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."], ["[301]", "The definition of \"use\" of a trade-mark in association with wares is found at section 4 of the", "Trade-marks Act", "4. (1) A trade-mark is deemed to be used in association with wares if, at the time of the transfer of the property in or possession of the wares, in the normal course of trade, it is marked on the wares themselves or on the packages in which they are distributed or it is in any other manner so associated with the wares that notice of the association is then given to the person to whom the property or possession is transferred.", "4. (1) Une marque de commerce est réputée employée en liaison avec des marchandises si, lors du transfert de la propriété ou de la possession de ces marchandises, dans la pratique normale du commerce, elle est apposée sur les marchandises mêmes ou sur les colis dans lesquels ces marchandises sont distribuées, ou si elle est, de toute autre manière, liée aux marchandises à tel point qu'avis de liaison est alors donné à la personne à qui la propriété ou possession est transférée."], ["[302]", "The expression \"in the normal course of trade\" has been interpreted as \"requiring that the transfer of the property in or of the possession of the wares be a part of a dealing in the wares for the purpose of acquiring goodwill and profits from the marked goods\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 395 (TMOB) [", "Cast Iron Soil Pipe", "]). Such a dealing requires some payment or exchange, which excludes the use of a trade-mark in situations where the wares are given away for free or donated. In situations where samples have been distributed for free, without any subsequent sales of this same product on the market, courts have consistently held that the alleged trade-mark was not used \"in the normal course of trade\": see, for example,", "Cast Iron Soil Pipe", ", above, at 395;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), 188 FTR 29 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> CPR (3d) 322 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  handing out of free samples of a product without subsequent distribution of said product on the market does not amount to \"use\" of the affixed mark as a trade-mark, and therefore does not trigger the application of paragraph 7(b) of the", "Trade-marks Act", ". This is precisely what the Defendants to the Counterclaim allege was done in 2005 when they temporarily distributed the Distrimedic original colour scheme. The evidence before this Court is that approximately 100,000 sheets with the same colour scheme as the Dispill Colour Scheme were printed. Both Mr. Filiatrault and Mr. Poirier testified that only a few batches of 500 sheets were distributed for free to approximately eleven pharmacies for testing purposes and to receive feedback on their product. This was apparently done over a period of several weeks in November and December 2005. Subsequently, these sheets are said to have been destroyed and never to have been sold by the pharmacists to their clients."], ["[304]", "It is true that the circumstances surrounding the printing and subsequent destruction of these initial sheets are far from clear, and that no evidence was produced to corroborate the testimonies of Messrs.

Filiatrault and Poirier."], ["[305]", "The only argument put forward by the Plaintiff by Counterclaim in that respect is that the same product codes (ETCA-500 and ETCP-500) were used by Distrimedic for labels bearing different colour schemes (the original Distrimedic colour scheme and a new design with different colours), thereby making it difficult to determine whether and when Distrimedic stopped using the Dispill Colour Scheme. This is far from sufficient to rebut the testimony of Messrs. Filiatrault and Poirier. There could be any number of reasons why the same product codes were used for the same product before and after the colour change."], ["[306]", "Finally, I note that Distrimedic suffered a loss on the sales of ETCP-500 and ETCA-500 labels, according to Richards' own accounting expert. Therefore, even if one were to assume that the labels were not destroyed and that all of the ETCP-500 and ETCA-500 labels bore the original Distrimedic colour scheme, these figures would tend to confirm that the labels were not used in the normal course of trade, and would not warrant an award of damages for passing off.", "iii.

In the present case, there has been no evidence of actual confusion. As previously mentioned when summarizing the evidence, Mr. Thibault is the only witness presented by Richards who met a Distrimedic representative during the period when the alleged misrepresentation occurred, and his evidence did not establish misrepresentation or confusion. Even if he may have thought that Dispill and Distrimedic relied on the same external supplier for their accessories, he was clearly aware that Dispill and Distrimedic were two different companies. He knew exactly who he was dealing with when he met Distrimedic's representative, and the representative did not misrepresent himself or his products in any way. When asked specifically whether or not he thought that Richards' and Distrimedic's products were linked, Mr. Thibault said no."], ["[308]", "As for Ms. Glaude, her testimony was far from satisfactory due to significant reliance on hearsay and double hearsay. Her descriptions were not very specific, and records of alleged misrepresentations were not kept by Richards prior to the commencement of the present lawsuit. If, in any event, there was any confusion among pharmacists when Distrimedic entered the market, it was quickly dispelled as a result of Richards sending them a notice to make sure they were aware that the new competitor on the market was not Dispill or authorized by Dispill; when asked about the effectiveness of this notice, Ms. Glaude answered that she believed it worked."], ["[309]", "Richards having failed to show actual confusion, it had to demonstrate that confusion was likely to occur. Such demonstration was not made."], ["[310]", "As previously mentioned, the customers of the container-sealing sheets bearing the Dispill Colour Scheme are pharmacists and, indirectly, administrators of nursing homes. According to the parties' submissions, the container-sealing sheets are rarely, if ever, sold to individual patients. Typically, pharmacists supply nursing homes directly, and nursing homes in turn distribute the medication to patients. Often the patient never sees the colour arrangements at issue, as individual doses are prepared by nurses or staff outside of the patient's view. Pharmacists and other health professionals are less likely than other customers to confuse products that they have the professional duty to use carefully and, as a result, the burden to show confusion is significantly higher than for mass consumption goods."], ["[311]", "Moreover, the pharmacist's decision to adopt a brand of pill dispensers is not a decision made in a hurry, as changing or adding brands involves many changes to the organization and affects client nursing homes. Going with a new supplier of pill dispensers involves numerous steps, such as ordering and paying for supply which involves calling a different phone number or writing to a different address, contacting the pharmacy software company and paying to have the Dispill or Distrimedic application installed on the pharmacy computer, training staff to use a new system of mounting pill dispensers, possibly reorganizing work stations to adapt to the new system and accessories, and informing clients of the change or addition to existing products. According to Mr. Thibault, a pharmacist may take anywhere from a few days to months to make a decision to switch after first being presented with a new pill-dispensing system. In addition, it has been recognized that health professionals are in no way influenced by the shape or colour of health products when choosing one product over another:", "Apotex Inc FC 2010, above,", "at para 33. For all of these reasons, pharmacists are unlikely to be confused into thinking that Dispill and Distrimedic pill dispensers both come from the same source, or that one is endorsed by the supplier of the other."], ["[312]", "The same is true for the nursing homes and their administrators. The choice and use of pill dispensers in those facilities is monitored and analyzed by health professionals. Absent any proof to the contrary, it is difficult to imagine that such professionals, whose responsibility is to ensure the smooth running of healthcare facilities, might be confused by a colour scheme, especially when the Dispill or Distrimedic trade names are printed clearly on the reverse side of the container-sealing sheet."], ["[313]", "In light of the above, and of the fact that no actual instance of confusion was put in evidence by Richards, it is obvious that none of the Defendants to the Counterclaim directed public attention to Distrimedic's wares, services or business in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause confusion in Canada within the meaning of paragraph 7(b) of the", "Trade-marks Act", ". Richards' claim under that provision must therefore fail, as it has not demonstrated any of the elements necessary for an action in passing off to succeed: i.e., a trade-mark with a reputation, a misrepresentation causing or likely to cause confusion, and damages resulting from such misrepresentation and confusion.

Others favoured a more restrictive view, requiring a work to be creative to be original. The Court decided to opt for a position that falls between these two extremes.

Such a broad characterization of the Dispill Label Form would obviously fail to attract any copyright protection. As previously shown, copyright does not protect ideas, schemes, methods or selection in the abstract, but rather the original expression of them. As such, the selection of information or fields of information is not a \"work\" susceptible of copyright protection. In my view, this finding is entirely obvious and this version of Richards' claim need not be discussed any further.

Even if the Distrimedic sheets that were sold during that period were the same size as that of the Dispill sheets, Dr. Abdelrahman said that they would have to be exactly the same to print properly using the Dispill module.

As for the Windows Form itself, Richards does not own any copyright in it. Consequently, the programming, presumably by employees of DLD, of a Distrimedic Application in the Mentor software (that not surprisingly uses the same interface as the Windows Form and pops up in the same manner prior to printing), cannot be said to constitute infringement of any of Richards' alleged copyrights."], ["[365]", "Richards has presented no tangible evidence of Distrimedic having authorized anyone to reproduce any portion of the DOS Form or Windows Form, or to otherwise infringe upon Richards' allegedly copyrighted material.

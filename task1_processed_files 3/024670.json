The 519 Patent was issued on January 2, 2007 to the named inventor, Dr. David Goldfarb, from a Canadian application filed in January 1975, which claimed priority based on a US application filed by Dr. Goldfarb on October 24, 1974. The Canadian application was put into conflict by the Canadian Patent Office in 1980 against an application filed in Canada by Gore US in order to determine the issue of inventorship. This gave rise to proceedings before this Court. In February 2001, Justice François Lemieux held that Dr. Goldfarb, instead of Peter Cooper, an employee of Gore US who had assigned his rights to Gore US, was the first inventor (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 184) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. This judgment was affirmed on appeal (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 167). Dr. Goldfarb's US patent application was also put in an interference proceeding against an application filed by Gore US.

The properties and method of manufacture of ePTFE are not new. They are prior art. Robert Gore was the inventor and obtained, in 1976, a patent on that invention."], ["[120] What was not known in 1970, however, was whether ePTFE tubing could have a medical use. Experimentation or search for use for it as a vascular graft in replacement for natural arteries and veins in humans began almost immediately after Mr. Gore filed his U. S. patent application in 1970."], ["[121] The invention, an appropriate range of fibril length in the material, is what made the ePTFE tubing useful for such purpose. The essential feature of the invention is the distance between the nodes (or the length of the fibres connecting them) which forms part of the internal structure of ePTFE tubing."], ["[122] An appropriate fibril length is what permits this ePTFE tubing to act as a useful artificial graft which remains patent because it allows cellular or fibroblastic movement and thus tissue ingrowth."], ["[8]", "The present action was initiated in 2013.

In each case approximately 1200 questions were not answered by the other side's representative and motions were brought to compel answers to some of them.

Where on the one hand both the probative value and the usefulness of the answer to the examining party would appear to be, at the most, minimal and where, on the other hand, obtaining the answer would involve great difficulty and a considerable expenditure of time and effort to the party being examined, the court should not compel an answer. One must look at what is reasonable and fair under the circumstances:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , (1987), 15 CPR (3d) 447, about the need for such balancing in patent infringement cases where the defendant is attacking the validity of the patent it allegedly infringed:"], ["[15] This passage therefore testifies more particularly that in a patent infringement action in which the defendant is attacking the validity of the patent, the Court has little inclination to force the plaintiff to engage in disproportionate research to support the allegations of invalidity raised by the defendant when, inter alia, the conclusions sought by this defending party pertain primarily to the interpretation that the Court will give to the patent claims in light of its reading of the patent, the state of the applicable law and any expert evidence adduced by the parties, and not in terms of what the plaintiff may have thought or argued in the past as to the validity of the patent."], ["[16] Similarly, Mr. Justice Hugessen, in Eli Lilly and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), stated the following at pages 414-15 concerning the relevance of the inventor's knowledge about the obviousness of an invention:", "I am not prepared to order the plaintiffs to produce documents relating to the state of knowledge of prior art on the part of the inventors or of the patentees at the time of the issue of the patents in suit.

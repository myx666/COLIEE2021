The Board noted that this differed widely from the evidence of the Sherriff's Department of Cowley County which stated that the applicant admitted to having sexual intercourse with the minor. Further, the applicant admitted in oral testimony that he was in fact 25 years old at the time.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The Board began its analysis by considering whether there was evidence to find that there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant committed a serious non-political offence. The Board found that the applicant was represented by counsel in Kansas, that he entered into a guilty plea before a judge and pled to the lesser included offence than the original charge of aggravated indecent liberties with a child, and that the applicant did not appeal the conviction or sentence. The Board concluded that on the burden of proof of more than a mere suspicion, there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant committed a serious non-political offence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The Board then considered whether the crime was a serious non-political crime.

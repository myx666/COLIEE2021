The Respondent says that the Officer's reasons and decisions in this regard were reasonable. The Applicant had lived in Colombo for 12 years.

In its view, the standard of a serious possibility of persecution is embedded within the phrase \"well-founded fear,\" and it is not an error for the Officer here to use the actual words of the statute to express the standard of proof.

The Respondent says one needs to look at the facts as a whole to assess any compelling reasons, and before there can be such compelling reasons, there needs to be a finding of persecution.

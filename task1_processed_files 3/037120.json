The Applicant contends that these conclusions of the learned judge are findings of fact binding on the Court as to what was not assessed and the existence of the risk the Applicant would face."], ["[14]", "Justice Zinn's comments on the legal issue are made in the context of the test on a stay application of \"serious issue\" - a low threshold. The findings on irreparable harm are also in the context of a stay where the issues are not fully and finally argued and analysed.

I also find no error regarding the board's treatment of the psychological report. The report concluded that the applicants would be \"at a high risk for retraumatization\" should they be forced to return to Costa Rica. However, I agree with the respondent that the report does not deal with the applicants' ability to access state protection in Costa Rica.

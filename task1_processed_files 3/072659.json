It makes no reference to the Act or Regulations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[53]", "Given that the examination was for compliance and that an advance copy of the compliance policy had been specifically requested by FINTRAC but was not provided; that its absence was listed as a deficiency in the April 29, 2009 correspondence from FINTRAC, which also requested that within thirty days it be provided with an action plan for bringing Homelife into compliance which request was not responded to; that Mr. Margosutjahjo's July 20, 2009 letter stated that he had now put in place a compliance policy but which did not provide a copy of that document, and; the absence of any explanation as to why the policy was not provided prior to August 21, 2009, it can reasonably be inferred that it did not exist at the time of the examination, as if it had, it would have been provided to FINTRAC prior to the Notice of Violation being issued.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[54]", "Accordingly, the Director's decision that there was a violation of this requirement was reasonable. In the absence of any evidence that reasonable steps were taken by Homelife to implement a policy in its office before the examination date, the due diligence defence was not made out.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[55]", "Violation #3 concerned the failure to assess and document the risk referred to in subsection 9.6(2) of the Act, taking into consideration prescribed factors. Subsection 9.6(2) requires the development and application of policies and procedures for the person or entity to assess, in the course of their activities, the risk of a money laundering offence or a terrorist activity financing offence. The prescribed factors are found in subsection 71(1)(c) of the Regulations and include (i) the clients and business relationship of the person or entity; (ii) the products and delivery channels of the person or entity; (iii) the geographic location of the activities of the person or entity; and (iv) any other relevant factor. The only evidence on the record concerning the risk assessment is the CREA form titled \"Risk Assessment for Brokerage dated February 19, 2009\" provided by Homelife an August 21, 2009. At the bottom of the document it states, \"This document has been prepared by The Canadian Real Estate Association for the explicit use by members in complying with the requirements of Canada's Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) © 2008. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[56]", "The CREA form merely sets out a series of questions and check marked answers from the options of \"frequently\", \"occasionally\", \"seldom\", \"never\", \"N/A\" and \"Don't Know\". It does not comprise an actual assessment of Homelife's risks in the context of its operations. While the CREA form is a tool that can be used to assess if, and how often, the listed risk factors arise  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's operations, it does not do more.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[57]", "As the risk assessment was one of the documents specifically requested by FINTRAC in its notice of compliance examination; its absence was listed as a deficiency in the April 29, 2009 correspondence from FINTRAC; and, as it was, without explanation, not provided until August 21, 2009, it is questionable as to whether it existed in March 25, 2009. In any event, it was open to the Director to determine that it did not suffice to meet the risk assessment requirements contained in the Act and the Regulations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[58]", "Given these facts, the Director's decision that there had been a violation was reasonable. In the absence of evidence that reasonable steps were taken to effect a risk assessment, the due diligence defence is not made out.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[59]", "Violation #4 concerned the failure to develop and maintain a written ongoing compliance training program for employees, agents or other persons. Again, FINTRAC requested that it be provided with a copy of the training program in advance of the compliance inspection by way of its letter of February 4, 2009. It also identified this as a deficiency in its April 29, 2009 letter. Mr. Margosutjahjo's letter of July 20, 2009 states that all sales staff are independent contractors but each has been trained and informed of their obligations during sales meetings. Each new salesperson will be informed of the compliance requirements and given a copy of the policy manual. However, no copy of the training policy was provided in response to FINTRAC's original request, its notice of deficiency and action plan requests or with Mr. Margosutjahjo's July 20, 2009 letter. The documents provided by Homelife on August 21, 2009 include twenty \"Certification of Completion of Compliance Training\" forms which certify completion of training by individuals which took place in August 2009, April 2009 or February 2009. These confirm attendance of agents at training described as 1. Money Laundering 101: all modules, as provided on the CREA website www.realtorlink.ca; 2. Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Reference Manual; 3. Firm's Compliance Policies and Procedures. Nine documents entitled \"Record of Additional Training\" with the names of attendees at the training program were also provided which described the type of training as \"monthly sales meetings\" for the period of January to August 2009. Nine memos of office meetings from January to August 2009 describe various subjects, such as office productions, FINTRAC, motivation, etc. and check off the names of the sales representatives in attendance.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[60]", "In my view, these documents would comprise an aspect of compliance training. However, they do not reference Homelife nor do they comprise a written ongoing compliance training program as they do not provide details of the program and how it is to be administered, but are merely a description of some training provided and the names of attendees. Further, some of the training occurred after the March 25, 2009 inspection. Accordingly, the Director's decision that, on a balance of probabilities, there had been a violation was reasonable. While there is evidence that Homelife took some steps to train its staff, these do not amount to reasonable steps to effect an ongoing compliance training program so as to avoid the offence and, accordingly, the due diligence defence was not established.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[61]", "Homelife also submits that the Director failed to consider the letter of explanation that it provided in response to the Notice of Violation. However, the Director recognized those submissions at the outset of the December 10, 2009 decision:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Further to the observations you have submitted to the Director of the Financial Transaction and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) concerning the Notice of Violation issued to Homelife Experience Realty on June 29, 2009, we are hereby providing you with this Notice of Decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[62]", "In", "Newfoundland and Labrador  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada held that under the reasonableness standard of review, reasons need not be perfect nor follow a particular form as long as they allow the parties and the reviewing court to understand why a decision was made. In this case, while the decision does not state why it did not accept the letter of explanation, it recognizes having considered those submissions. And, significantly, the information that was before the Director supports her findings.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[63]", "Given all of the foregoing, in my view, the Director's decision with respect to the commission of the violations falls within \"a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[64]", "As to the penalty, the Act stipulates that the amount of the penalty shall in each case be determined by considering that the purpose of the penalty is to encourage compliance with the Act, rather than to punish, and taking into account the harm done by the violator, which could be an aggravating or mitigating factor (subsection 73.11). Further, classification and amounts of penalties may be prescribed by regulation (subsection 73.1). This is effected by the", "Proceeds from Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations,", "SOR/2007-292 (Penalties Regulations). These state that violations are classified as minor, serious or very serious (subsection 4(1)) and that the range of penalties for violations is $1-$1,000 for a minor violation, $1-$100, 000 for a serious violation and $1-$500, 000 for a very serious violation (section 5). Compliance history is also to be taken into account (section 6). The Schedule to the Penalties Regulations classifies violations of subsection 9.6(1) of the Act and subsections 71(1)(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the Regulations as being serious offences.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[65]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that, although not explicitly, Max Realty had also contested the amount of the fine imposed by the Director. However, without any reasons, or even reference to fines imposed in comparable circumstances, the Court could not determine if the fine was reasonable or not.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[66]", "In the present case, the Director found that the facts did not support a finding that the fifth violation set out in the Notice of Violation had been committed and, therefore, withdrew that violation and accordingly imposed a lesser penalty of $27,000, rather than the $37,500 stated in the notice. By letter of September 8, 2009, Mr. Margosutjahjo wrote to FINTRAC stating that, at Ms. Julie Ethier, Senior Review Officer's suggestion (letter of August 26, 2009), he was providing the documents enclosed which were unaudited financial statements and tax returns described above. The record does not contain an August 26, 2006 letter of FINTRAC, however, it is reasonable to assume that the purpose of providing this financial information was in connection with the fine imposed by the Director and to seek a reconsideration of the fine amount. Mr. Margosutjahjo confirmed this at the hearing. The December 10, 2009 decision notes that the Director considered the information provided regarding Homelife's inability to pay the revised penalty and had decided to maintain the fine.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[67]", "There is no explanation as to why the specific penalty was chosen, what factors were considered in sentencing, or why the Director decided to maintain it.

Further, that subsequent notices of violations issued in other matters have provided a more fulsome fine analysis. Also, that there is an internal fine policy which was not provided, but which has subsequently been distributed to other violators. The policy apparently contains guidance for fines imposed based on the amount of harm caused, compliance history, as well as the size of the entity and its ability to pay.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[69]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Federal Court of Appeal stated at paragraph 102 that, \"In truth, the considerations relevant to sentencing may overlap with those governing the imposition of an administrative penalty since both are designed to prevent statutorily prohibited conduct\".

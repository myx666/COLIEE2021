Garbitt et al.", ", [1997] B.C.T.C. Uned. 818; [1997] B.C.J. No. 1250 (S.C.). In that case, the band had passed the Saulteau Indian Band Government Law (the \"Law\") in 1988 under which it was recognized by INAC (then the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) as a band which selected its council according to the custom of the band. The Law contained a provision as to its own amendment. In the fall of 1996, a certain number of resolutions were passed concerning the procedures for electing the chief and council. The issue raised before the Court was how the Law, as to amendments, was to be viewed and interpreted. Parrett, J., noted that the proper interpretation of that Law, applying the custom of the band, was that for the Law to be amended, appropriate notice had to be given to citizens of the proposed amendments, citizens had to be consulted on the desirability of the proposed amendments, and the majority of citizens had to consent to, or vote for, the amendments. However, he also noted that the strict wording of the amendment provisions of the Law had not usually been followed by the band in practice. Rather than operate with strict technical adherence to the Law, the band had adapted the Law to reflect the band's needs as they emerged. The court concluded that the custom of the band with respect to \"amending\" its Law had been to seek consensus within the band by means of informal votes or by means of band meetings. The actions of the so-called \"dissidents\", the defendants in that case, represented attempts to pursue change by democratic means while the actions of the other side, the plaintiffs, appeared to be an attempt to retain power at the expense of democratic principles."], ["[34]", "Having said that, I do not consider that it can be claimed that all customary rules which may be invoked by individual band members have a content exactly identical to that of the rules contained in an electoral code. On a number of points, the areas governed by the two sources of law may not exactly overlap, and the substantive rules in which they are framed may not be identical in content. Indeed, this will often be the case with more technical rules governing the conduct of elections which may or may not be applied consistently in practice, depending on the attendant circumstances. The relevant question is whether a particular rule in an electoral code also exists as a customary rule, either because the code has merely codified the custom of the band, or caused it to \"crystallise\", or because it has influenced its subsequent adoption."], ["[35]", "Thus, one will have to determine how an electoral code has been applied in practice in a given situation, for instance vis-à-vis the question of who is entitled to vote and who will administer the conduct of the elections or by-elections. It is quite common that behaviours arising through attitudes, habits, abstentions, shared understandings and tacit acquiescence develop alongside a codified rule and may colour, specify, complement and sometimes even limit the text of a particular rule. Such behaviours may become the new custom of the band which will have an existence of its own and whose content will sometimes not be identical to that of the codified rule pertaining to a particular issue. In such cases, and bearing in mind the evolutionary nature of custom, one will have to ascertain whether there is a broad consensus in the community at a given time as to the content of a particular rule or the way in which it will be implemented."], ["[36]", "For a rule to become custom, the practice pertaining to a particular issue or situation contemplated by that rule must be firmly established, generalized and followed consistently and conscientiously by a majority of the community, thus evidencing a \"broad consensus\" as to its applicability. This would exclude sporadic behaviours which may tentatively arise to remedy certain exceptional difficulties of implementation at a particular moment in time as well as other practices which are clearly understood within the community as being followed on a trial basis. If present, such a \"broad consensus\" will evidence the will of the community at a given time not to consider the adopted electoral code as having an exhaustive and exclusive character. Its effect will be to exclude from the equation an insignificant number of band members who persistently objected to the adoption of a particular rule governing band elections as a customary one."], ["[37]", "In my view, in light of all the abovementioned cases, the real question as to whether a particular band resolution, decision or an adopted electoral code reflects the custom of the band can be framed as follows: is the resolution, decision or code based on a majority consensus of all those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the band, regardless of residency?"], ["[38]", "With these general principles in mind, I will now consider what is the custom of the Band applicable to the present dispute.", "IV- ANALYSIS OF THE CUSTOM OF THE BAND"], ["[39]", "Conflicting views have been taken with regards to the character and effects of the", "Code", "to which the impugned decision refers.

Interested parties agreed that the court should first dispose of the jurisdictional issue. Further delays ensued. In the meantime, what was labelled by the media as the \"Oka Crisis\" received national coverage during the summer of 1991. The Oka Crisis was a 78 day standoff which was sparked when the municipality of Oka tried to expand a golf course onto disputed land which was claimed to be Mohawk territory. In the early days of this standoff, a Sûreté du Québec officer was shot and killed. The judgment of the court came a few months after the Oka Crisis.

The aforementioned would be reduced from nine to seven members. I will not insist on this aspect since all parties agree that the smaller size, which corresponds to the size of all the councils elected since 1992, is part of the custom of the Band. However, I note that the Council in subsequent resolutions passed since 1992 has consistently referred to the said reduction as an \"amendment\".

However, there is insufficient evidence on record to permit the court to infer that those documents were in fact distributed to all Band members, regardless of their place of residence, with a notice of the purpose of the May 20, 1992 meeting.

He explained that \"[t]he nominations have been going on and will continue\" and that the deadline for the nominations would be on May 23, 1992, at 10:00 p.m. As can be seen, there were 21 days between the last day of the nominations and the election date, a fact upon which the applicants rely on to affirm that since 1992 the custom of the Band is to allow at least 21 days (and not 12 days as mentioned in the Regulations) between the nomination meeting and the election day. Grand Chief Peltier concluded the meeting by mentioning: \"... make sure your name is on the voters' list and you have to be 18 years and over the last day to check whether your name is on the voters' list is May the 30th, which is a Saturday 1992 [sic]\" (ibid, at 4). This statement clearly suggests that all Band members aged 18 years and over regardless of their residence were entitled to vote at this election. Actually, the list of electors prepared by the consulting firm, dated June 4, 1992, included non-resident Community members as well (List of Electors for the June 13, 1992 Kanesatake Mohawk Council Election, letter dated May 27, 1992 from J.

There were 1107 eligible voters left, out of which 739 were residents and 368 were non-resident Community members. Out of that number, some 567 electors voted on June 13, 1992, including 398 residents and 169 non-residents. Grand Chief Peltier was re-elected to that position together with six other candidates as chiefs for a three-year period."], ["[60]", "Although the draft", "Code", "has been in fact remodelled since the May 20, 1992 meeting, what appears to be the current version of the", "Code", "and accompanying Regulations have never been officially adopted by the Council, nor have they been ratified by the Community.

The official Notices of Election issued by the Council on both occasions clearly state that all Band members aged 18 years and over on voting day were eligible to vote (Exhibits \"L\" and \"S\" to the affidavit of Nathalie Nepton, dated December 10, 2002). 603 electors voted in the June 27, 1998 election.

All Band members 18 years of age and over, including non-residents, were entitled to vote on the ratification. 476 voters expressed their opinion (Legal opinion of the Honourable Lawrence A.

Furthermore, the evidence on record does not show that proper notice or the time and purpose of the May 20, 1992 meeting were given to all Band members interested, particularly the non-residents, since their voting rights were affected by the draft", "Code", ". Moreover, there is no way of knowing who actually voted on May 20, 1992, and who was previously consulted by telephone or participated in a workshop. But, more importantly, the figure of participation, 85 persons, is strikingly low compared to the usual numbers counted in past elections since 1992 or in the 2000 plebiscite, and which (except for the 1993 by-election) normally varied between 400 and 750 voters who exercised their rights to vote out of some 1100 eligible voters.

This is certainly not the case."], ["[63]", "Inasmuch as reliance is placed by the respondents on the fact that the draft", "Code", "was adopted \"in principle\" at the Community meeting held on May 20, 1992, they have failed to establish that the participation of 85 persons which resulted in 68 votes in favour, 16 against, and one abstention, constitutes a \"broad consensus\" sufficient in these special circumstances to consider that the", "Code", "now constitutes the custom of the Band.

However, the evidence discussed above, which may not have been brought to the attention of Tremblay-Lamer, J., convinces me that no such general conclusion can be reached where it comes to fundamental principles of exclusion of non-residents and the enforcement of the", "Code", "and Regulations' provisions respecting the election of Election Supervisors and members of the Council of Elders."], ["[64]", "Furthermore, the evidence shows that there has been a continuous intention, publicly expressed through various resolutions and communiques of the Council, to permit non-residents to vote and resort to independent agencies retained by Council and charged with organizing and supervising the electoral process. In none of these elections was there any recourse to a Council of Elders or Election Supervisors. I find in this regard that the conduct of the Band members in acquiescing to these practices is sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirement that the latter were \"generally acceptable to members of the Band upon which there is broad consensus\"."], ["[65]", "In coming to the above conclusion, I have also considered the fact that following the 1998 election, complaints were made and concerns were expressed in the name of some 85 Band members who were not satisfied with the outcome of the election and sought to overturn it on the grounds that it was not conducted \"in strict adherence with the", "Code", "\" (Exhibits \"F\", \"G\" and \"H\" to the affidavit of Steven Bonspille, dated December 10, 2002).

I also accept the applicants' evidence that the October 19, 2002 meeting was not authorized by the applicants and that the notice was improper and insufficient to the extent that non-resident Band members were not given proper notice and thus were unable to express their views on the matter (affidavit of James Gabriel, dated December 1, 2002, paragraphs 18 and 19 and Exhibit \"G\" to said affidavit).", "Conclusion"], ["[67]", "In view of the above evidence, which I find conclusive, I have no hesitation in concluding that the strict enforcement, either by Council, its Executive Director or other electoral officers, of the residency requirements mentioned in Article 2 of the", "Code", "would be contrary to the custom of the Band.

It is apparent from a comparison of the two documents that the authors of the 1995 version substantially amended the 1992 version. The 1995 version incorporates some of the changes suggested by some of the participants at the consultative process.

The Mohawk Council of Kanesatake would like to advise all Kanesatake Band members that a draft Election Code, which is still a discussion paper, is presently being circulated within the Community.", "The circulation of this document within the Community is only causing confusion and unwarranted concern.", "On the first page of the draft it is clearly marked 'draft'", "and it has not been discussed by the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake", "nor has it been ratified by the Community.", "Therefore, if anyone has any questions about the forthcoming election, please do not hesitate to contact the Election Consultants office of DAYE AND VINCENT at 479-8256 and clarify any misunderstandings.", "Nia wen", "THE MOHAWK COUNCIL OF KANESATAKE\"", "(Communique, Draft Election Code, Exhibit \"C\" to the affidavit of Andrew Hayes)"], ["[71]", "Second, the Regulations to which Article 9 of the", "Code", "refers can be legally binding only once the", "Code", "itself has been ratified.

The systematic recourse by Council in past elections to independent agencies ensured that all electors (residents and non-residents) and candidates were not discriminated against and were treated fairly. This practice of appointing such agencies and of allowing non-resident Band members to vote must therefore be considered as part of the custom of the Band which implicitly incorporates the respect of the rules of natural justice and associated principles."], ["[73]", "I have also considered the parties' evidence with respect to the meeting that took place on December 4, 2002, to elect Election Supervisors and the Council of Elders.

The Election Supervisors are Sonya Gagnier, Sheila Bonspille, Clifton Nicolas, Jonathan Peltier and Janet Nicolas. The members of the Council of Elders are Noreen Cree, Shawhanatsi Montour, Charlotte Beaver, Paul Bonspille and Llyod Figie. It is admitted that the election of Election Supervisors and members of the Council of Elders were not elected by secret ballot. I accept the applicants' evidence that most of the persons who attended the meeting are clearly opposed to the applicants and also that Election Supervisors and members of the Council of Elders, in view of their past conduct, their family links or because they are parties or related to parties named in contempt proceedings or other proceedings before the court (reply affidavit of James Gabriel, dated December 12, 2002, paragraph 10 and Exhibits \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\" to said affidavit), are openly biased, or at least that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists here.

However, given the conclusion that I have reached with respect to the infringement of the plaintiff's", "Charter", "rights in this case, it is unnecessary for me to reach a conclusion on this issue.

In that context, the present case does not allow for the \"aboriginal right to self-government\" argument that the respondents are raising in their memorandum.

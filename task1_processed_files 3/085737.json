While there is no doubt that the parties take very different positions on those issues, I do not consider that to give rise to a situation where a decision by the Court on the merits of their respective arguments will have a practical effect on solving a live controversy. In", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", ", the Supreme Court referred to the necessity to determine whether the requisite tangible and concrete dispute has disappeared, rendering the issues academic.

The issue of mootness was raised because the Commission dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction before the judicial review was decided.

The plaintiffs seek: a declaration that they are entitled to receive all benefits that have been received by members of the band; a declaration that they are entitled to receive future benefits made available to band members; an ac­counting of all benefits; and general damages plus interest. The claim alleges joint and several liability on the part of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada as represented by the Minister of Indian and Inuit Affairs (\"the Crown\") and the Ermineskin defen­dants.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "Prothonotary Hargrave has described the Statement of Claim and the Ermineskin defendants' motion in a concise and clear fashion.

The plaintiffs say that despite many requests all of the defen­dants, including the Ermineskin Band, have refused to deal with the question of the plaintiffs' membership in the Band as provided for by the membership rules and code (paragraph 13 of the Statement of Claim). This brings us to the crux of State­ment of Claim, paragraph 14, which sets out that all of the defendants have breached a fiduciary duty to all of the plaintiffs. The particulars of the breach included allowing deletion of the names of the plaintiffs from the Band membership, failing to add subsequently born issue to the Band list and failing to protect the interest of the plaintiffs, in the result de­priving the plaintiffs of the benefit they would have had as members of the Ermineskin Band. In full paragraph 14 is as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "'14. Each and all of the defendant's herein have a fiduciary duty to each and all of the plaintiffs herein and that this fiduciary duty has been breached by each and all of the defendants herein, some particulars of which are as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "a) Allowing the deletion of the names of the plaintiffs, Larry Hodgson, Harley Hodgson, Amy Pugh, Alma Duwar, and Peggy Lundie from the Ermineskin Band list as of January 7, 1944, thereby depriving the plaintiffs of any benefits, financial or otherwise, they would have received as Ermineskin Band Members subsequent to January 7, 1944 to date of trial;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "b) Failing to add the names of the plaintiffs, Theodore Hodgson, Dennis Hodgson and Carol Leeb to the Ermineskin Band List as of their re­spective dates of birth thereby de­priving the said plaintiffs from any benefits, financial or otherwise, they may have received as Ermineskin Band Members subsequent to their respective dates of birth to date of trial;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "c) Failing to advise the plaintiffs herein as to the benefits they may be entitled to and failing to protect the interest of the plaintiffs herein by taking a course of action which has deprived the plain­tiffs herein from benefits, financial and otherwise, that they are entitled to as members of the Ermineskin Indian Band.'  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"The Ermineskin Band wishes all references to the Band, as in 'all of the defendants' removed from paragraphs 13 and 14 and from all of the portions of the prayer for relief except paragraph (a).

The \"plain and obvious\" test applies to the striking out of pleadings for lack of jurisdic­tion in the same manner as it applies to the striking out of any pleading on the ground that it evinces no reasonable cause of action. The lack of jurisdiction must be \"plain and obvious\" to justify a striking out of pleadings at this preliminary stage.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The tests for Federal Court jurisdiction were set out in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 766  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .

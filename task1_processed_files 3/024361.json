At the interview with the immigration officer in 2011, he explained that he indicated that he was not married because the marriage was not registered at the time. He also noted that he had advised his immigration consultant of his change in status since his original application in 1999 and the consultant advised him to say that he was not married. The consultant allegedly told Mr Ahmed that he could sponsor his family later, as his marriage was not registered at that time.

Examples of such compelling reasons include where the sponsor believed the person was dead or his whereabouts were unknown or where disclosure would put the family member at risk. An inadvertent omission to declare a family member did not constitute a compelling reason in that case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "The respondent submits that the misrepresentations in this case were not inadvertent, but deliberate.

The Applicant did not know whether her own name was on the passport she used to travel, nor did she know the name of her smuggler.

Incorrectly revising the Applicant's understanding of a Biblical passage, the Applicant posits, showed the Board Member's adherence to a particular dogma, which was akin to pre-writing the decision. I cannot accept the Applicant's arguments on this point. Asking the Applicant questions about her beliefs and her Biblical knowledge was an important exercise given the facts of the case. The Member was not \"interpreting\" the Biblical passage in question, but rather was asking the Applicant a pointed question about what was contained in the text. While a focus on this particular point may not be a reasonable ground, on its own, to discredit the Applicant's contention that she is a Christian -- a point that will be discussed in more detail below -- it was not the only factor the Board took into account, and does not amount to an apprehension of bias.", "B.", "Christian Identity"], ["[28]", "The Applicant submits that the Board erred in its determination of her Christian identity by:", "a) substituting a test of \"motivation for adherence\" for \"sincerity of belief\";", "b) applying a demanding standard for textual and doctrinal knowledge;", "c) applying preconceived concepts of dogma;", "d) relying on a mistake of fact with respect to Biblical text; and", "e) failing to give weight to evidence of Christian identity such as baptism, church attendance, recital of prayers, Biblical familiarity, and proselytizing."], ["[29]", "Determining whether the Applicant is a practicing Christian, as she suggests, is an exercise for which considerable deference is owed to the Board, the trier of fact.

The questions do not amount to the level of capriciousness or arbitrariness, however, given the Applicant's testimony that she reads the Bible - specifically the New Testament, where this story is found - ten hours each week, and attends Bible study classes. In any event, this particular line of questioning is not the sole basis on which the Board crafted its conclusion.

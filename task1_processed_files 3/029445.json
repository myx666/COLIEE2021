At that time, AANDC delegated its responsibility in this regard to Sagkeeng. As a result, Sagkeeng became the employer of the teachers, who had previously been federal public servants, and transitioned those personnel to its Pension Plan. As the employer of the teachers, Sagkeeng was responsible for making the employer contributions to the Pension Plan."], ["[3]", "The Pension Plan is a defined benefits plan (\"DB Plan\").

The BEB Policy sets express limits on the amount that AANDC will fund employer contributions to DC Plans. It also contains an exemption for three DB Plans, including the Pension Plan. The exception does not provide an upper limit but instead provides that funding will be based on Actuarial Valuation Reports (\"AVR\"s)."], ["[6]", "An AVR for the fiscal period ending August 31, 2008 identified, for the first time since its inception, that the Pension Plan was in a deficit position. The Pension Plan remained in a deficit position in the fiscal years 2009-2012, and Sagkeeng, as the employer, was required to make special payments to keep the Pension Plan solvent. Sagkeeng requested additional funding from AANDC to cover the cost of the special payments. In August 2010 AANDC advised Sagkeeng that special payments were not eligible for funding."], ["[7]", "Sagkeeng requested adjudication pursuant to the BEB Policy's dispute resolution mechanism.

Other relevant factors include the burden of a previous finding, expeditiousness and costs."], ["[92]", "The Supreme Court of Canada noted that at the relevant time in that matter there were no by-laws in force in relation to the procedure before the Senate appeal committee. However, by-laws subsequently approved were admitted into evidence and considered by the Court.

There is thus no jurisdictional lacuna in the senate committee which could have prevented it from giving full justice to appellant."], ["[93]", "The Supreme Court concluded that the appellant's right of appeal to the Senate committee provided him with an adequate alternative remedy."], ["[94] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> can, of course, be distinguished from the matter before me both because the appeal process was statute-based and because it was an appeal.

I do not believe that the category of factors should be closed, as it is for courts in particular circumstances to isolate and balance the factors which are relevant."], ["[98]", "There, when applying the adequate alternate remedy principle, the Court considered the adequacy of the statutory appeal procedures created by the band and not just the adequacy of the appeal tribunals and concluded that it was open to the motions judge to find that allowing the respondents to circumvent the appeal procedures created by the bands would be detrimental to the overall scheme in light of its policy objectives. These included the promotion of Aboriginal self-government and respect for the appeal procedures developed by the bands given that the purpose of s 83(3) of the", "Indian Act", "was to allow bands to develop their own internal appeal procedures."], ["[99]", "The Supreme Court then addressed the respondents' submission that the statutory appeal procedures were not an adequate alternative to judicial review because the appeals tribunal gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. One basis for this allegation was that band members may be appointed to the appeal tribunals raising the issue of the impartiality of those members. The Court agreed with the applicants that the allegations of a reasonable apprehension of bias were speculative. This was because the allegations were made before the respondents had applied to the appeal tribunal and before any members had been appointed to them, yet the respondents were asking the Court to find that they could not obtain an impartial hearing. There was an important interest in having band members sit on appeal tribunals and the concern that these members might be inclined to increase taxes in order to maximise the income flowing to the band was simply too remote to constitute a reasonable apprehension of bias at a structural level."], ["[100]", "As to the second basis of the allegation of reasonable apprehension of bias, this arose from the fact that the tribunal members may not be paid, lacked security of tenure and were appointed by Band Chief and Councils, that is that the tribunals lacked sufficient institutional independence."], ["[101]", "The Court noted that the principles of security of tenure, security of remuneration and administrative control also apply in the case of an administrative tribunal where it is functioning as an adjudicative body settling disputes and determining the rights of the parties, although their strict application is not always warranted in that circumstance. Further that:"], ["[81] The classic test for a reasonable apprehension of bias is that stated by de Grandpré J. in", "Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 394:", ". . .the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. In the words of the Court of Appeal, that test is \"what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically -- and having thought the matter through -- conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that Mr. Crowe, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly\".", "De Grandpré J. further held that the grounds for the apprehension must be \"substantial\"."], ["[102]", "The Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> noted that in the case of administrative tribunals, the requisite level of institutional independence must be applied in light of the functions being performed by the particular tribunal at issue. The requisite levels security of tenure, financial security and administrative control will depend on the nature of the tribunal, the interest at stake and other indices of independence such as oaths of office. It then assessed the provisions of the assessment of the by-laws dealing with the power of the appeal tribunals and the appointment and recommendation of its members. It concluded that a combination of three factors i) the complete absence of financial security for tribunal members ii) inadequate security of tenure, and iii) tribunal members were required to determine the interest of the very people, the bands, to whom they owed their appointments, led to a reasonable apprehension that the members of the appeal tribunals were not sufficiently independent. Ultimately, the majority found that \"[t]he function of institutional independence is to ensure that a tribunal is legally structured such that its members are reasonably independent of those who appoint them\" (para 104)."], ["[103]", "As stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the test for institutional independence must be applied in light of the functions being performed by the particular tribunal at issue. In this matter the function is purely an internal and informal administrative adjudication process to interpret and apply a policy. It is not an appeal tribunal, and there is no set procedure. Unlike <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the DG's role is not the performance of adjudication functions similar to those of the courts. The adjudication is a role imposed on the DG by virtue of his or her position. However, there is no evidence as to how the position of DG is filled, whether by hiring by the Public Service Commission or appointment by the Governor in Council; and whether the DG's position is subject to the ADM or DM's ongoing approval. Thus, it is unknown if security of tenure or financial security are even relevant factors."], ["[104]", "Further, although the recommended approach to only partially fund the Pension Plan shortfall was approved by the ADM, in my view it has not been established that because of this the DG is, on an anticipatory basis, more likely than not to fail to decide the issue fairly. It could equally be the case that if the DG disagreed with the recommendation, or made a different one, that the ADM would also approve and authorize that approach or decision. The burden of proof is on the party alleging a reasonable apprehension of bias (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). And, as noted above, the differences between judicial and administrative decision-making require flexibility in the assessment of an administrative decision-maker's independence (", "2747-3174  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [", "Hughes", "];", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). A mere suspicion of bias is not enough (", "Hughes", "at para 43). Here the allegation is anticipatory and there is no evidence as to potential bias. Accordingly, in my view, Sagkeeng has not met its onus in this regard and the presumptions of independence and impartiality are not rebutted. A reasonable apprehension of bias on an institutional level requires the identification of a substantial number of similar cases (", "2747-3174 Québec", "at para 44). Sagkeeng has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish a reasonable apprehension of bias on either an institutional or a case by case basis and I am not convinced that the DG would not adjudicate the issue fairly."], ["[106]", "In reaching this decision I also note the Respondents' position, as to the nature of the decision, that the Crown's funding decisions are a matter of policy and are not subject to judicial review on administrative law grounds. Further, that Sagkeeng is asking the Court to scrutinize a decision that, at its essence, relates to how the government disburses public monies. The Respondents submit that absent statutory language or other legal requirements, that it is not the Court's role to make such determinations (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Conversely, Sagkeeng submits that the decision is purely administrative. There is no specific federal legislation regulating the funding of benefits payable to Aboriginal band employees and the BEB Policy fills this void, sets out the objective of the BEB Program and describes disbursement of funds. Because the application seeks judicial review of the decision on the basis that it does not comply with the BEB Policy this Court can review decisions of a Minister interpreting policy criteria and determine whether that interpretation will result in the objective set by the policy. Sagkeeng submits that this is to be distinguished from a review of a Minister's spending authority (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[107]", "Because I am of the view that the application is premature, I need not address the nature of the decision. I note the above, however, because if the application were not premature and if the Respondents' position as to the justiciability of the decision were correct, and I make no finding in that regard, Sagkeeng would be left with no avenue for review of the decision. Further, the parties' submissions on the nature of the decision simply reinforce my view that, at first instance, the nature of this issue is such that it should first be adjudicated by the DG as contemplated by the BEB Policy."], ["[108]", "As I have found that this application for judicial review is premature, I need not decide this issue on the merits. The matter is referred back and shall be adjudicated by the DG pursuant to the administrative dispute resolution provision of the BEB Policy. As that process is not defined, I would point out that the DG is required to be impartial, unbiased and to fully and fairly consider all of the submissions before him or her. In my view, the adjudication should, in effect, be a", "de novo", "review and the DG should provide reasons for his or her ultimate decision."], ["[109]", "In that regard, I note that the March 7, 2012 decision contains no reasons. Subsequent to the decision being made Ms. Stiller filed her affidavit in support of the Respondents' position in this application or judicial review. As noted by Sagkeeng, in her affidavit Ms. Stiller sets out, in considerable detail, the reasons for her decision. For purposes of judicial review, it is unacceptable for a decision-maker to \"bootstrap\" their decision in this manner (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) and it is trite law that the record before this Court on judicial review is generally restricted to that which was before the decision-maker (", "Assn of Universities", "at para 19). As I am not addressing the decision on the merits I need not address the weight or admissibility of Ms. Stiller's affidavit in this context. However, in my view, when adjudicating the dispute, that affidavit should not be placed before the DG. The Respondents, as well as Sagkeeng, no doubt will make submissions in support of their positions, but the Stiller Affidavit providing after the fact reasons for the disputed decision should not be one of them."], ["[110]", "In the event that, when the DG's decision has been rendered, Sagkeeng is of the view that it contains a reviewable error, at that time it may seek judicial review of that decision.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[111]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "1. This application for judicial review is premature. The matter is remitted back to the AANDC for adjudication pursuant to the BEB Policy.", "2.

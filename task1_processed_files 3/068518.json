The molar ratio of ciprofloxacin to lactic acid is thus 1.", "The ciprofloxacin lactate concentration in Höffken's solutions is already close to the solubility limit at room temperature. Thus in repeated attempts to prepare formulations those obtained are in some cases still clear but in other cases already display cloudiness, depending on the batches of ciprofloxacin and lactic acid employed and other limiting conditions (Table 1).", "It was surprising and could not be predicted by the skilled man that the solubility problems which were also inherent in the Höffken solutions could be eliminated by adding an excess of a physiologically tolerated acid.\"", "26. In addition, as of the date of the April 18, 1989 declaration, the named inventors only had demonstrated that a molar ratio of 1.33:1 (mol of lactic acid: mol of ciprofloxacin) provided the stable solution.

Another way of putting the matter would be to say that for the test as to relevance to the final issue of the case, the issue to be decided should be looked to before the question is answered by the prothonotary, whereas that as to whether it is interlocutory or final (which is purely a", "pro forma", "matter) should be put after the prothonotary's decision. Any other approach, is seems to me, would reduce the more substantial question of \"vital to the issue of the case\" to the merely procedural issue of interlocutory or final, and preserve all interlocutory rulings from attack (except in relation to errors of law).", "This is why, I suspect, he uses the words \"they [being the orders] raise questions vital to the final issue of the case\", rather than \"they [being the orders] are vital to the final issue of the case\".

In essence what is called for in the specification (including both disclosure and claims) is a description of the invention and the method of producing and constructing it, coupled with a claim or claims which state those novel features in which the applicant wants the exclusive right; the specification must define the precise and exact extent of the exclusive property and privilege claimed. The Act requires that an applicant file a specification, including disclosure and claims, whereby everything that is essential for the invention to function properly is disclosed. To be complete it must meet two conditions: it must describe the invention and define the way it is produced or built; and it must define the nature of the invention and how to put it into operation. Failure to define the first would render the application invalid for ambiguity; failure to meet the second renders it invalid for insufficiency. The description must be full enough to enable a person skilled in the art to produce the invention using only the disclosure in the patent."], ["[11]", "The specification part of the patent must show and describe the invention and define the way it is produced or built.

The disclosure is the", "quid", "provided by the inventor in exchange for the", "quo", "of a 17-year (now 20-year) monopoly on the exploitation of the invention. The monopoly is enforceable by an array of statutory and equitable remedies and it is therefore important for the public to know what is prohibited and where they may safely go while the patent is still in existence. The public notice function is performed by the claims that conclude the specification and must state \"distinctly and in explicit terms the things or combinations that the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property or privilege\" (s. 34(2))\". An inventor is not obliged to claim a monopoly on everything new, ingenious and useful disclosed in the specification. The usual rule is that what is not claimed is considered disclaimed.", "43. The first step in a patent suit is therefore to construe the claims. Claims construction is antecedent to consideration of both validity and infringement issues. The appellants' argument is that these two inquiries -- validity and infringement -- are distinct, and that if the principles of \"purposive construction\" derived from", "Catnic", "are to be adopted at all, they should properly be confined to infringement issues only.

In my view, those references to the inventor's intention refer to an objective manifestation of that intent in the patent claims, as interpreted by the person skilled in the art, and do not contemplate extrinsic evidence such as statements or admissions made in the course of patent prosecution. To allow such extrinsic evidence for the purpose of defining the monopoly would undermine the public notice function of the claims, and increase uncertainty as well as fuelling the already overheated engines of patent litigation. The current emphasis on purposive construction, which keeps the focus on the language of the claims, seems also to be inconsistent with opening the pandora's box of file wrapper estoppel. If significant representations are made to the Patent Office touching the scope of the claims, the Patent Office should insist where necessary on an amendment to the claims to reflect the representation.", "67.

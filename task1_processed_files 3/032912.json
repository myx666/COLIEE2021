The applicant is a citizen of the Republic of Georgia, who fled that country due to an alleged fear of violence at the hands of a member of the police force in Georgia with whom she claims she had an extramarital affair."], ["[4]", "The applicant first went to the United States of America in 1999, allegedly to have a break from this individual, and travelled under her own passport. At this point she says she had not yet decided to leave Georgia permanently and, indeed, voluntarily returned to Georgia in 2000. She says her husband was killed in an automobile accident in 2000 and that the individuals responsible for the accident approached her lover, to try and have him pressure her to stop making inquiries about the accident. When she refused to do so, she says that her lover threatened and beat her, causing her to seek to flee Georgia to return to the U.S. She claims that she was too frightened to seek a U.S. visa in Georgia as she feared her lover was having her watched and instead went to Moscow, where she purchased a false Russian passport, issued under the name of Irina Khachirova. She obtained the requisite U.S. visa under the false passport and returned to the U.S. in September of 2001, using the Khachirova passport. In early 2002, the applicant's own passport was returned to her by a friend, and, consequently, the applicant was then in possession of two passports."], ["[5]", "After she had received her own passport, the applicant was charged with shoplifting in May 2002. She provided her name as Irina Khachirova and a conviction was entered against her under this name. It is unclear whether she provided the authorities with the Khachirova passport in respect of these charges. The applicant received a small fine for this shoplifting offence."], ["[6]", "Later that year, in September 2002, the applicant made an asylum claim with the U.S. authorities under her own name and presumably provided them with her own passport. In 2005 she was again convicted of and fined for shoplifting, this time in her own name. In 2009, the applicant was deported from the U.S. to Georgia, and in 2010 she came to Canada and made a refugee claim here."], ["[7]", "The applicant provided incomplete and inaccurate information about her American convictions in her Personal Identification Form [PIF] that she filed in support of her Canadian asylum claim. In the original PIF, she referred only to having faced charges for (but not being convicted of) shoplifting in 2002, and in her amended PIF referred only to the second conviction, which she represented as being her first \"defence\" (by which she presumably meant her first offence). Through questioning, the Member discovered that the applicant had, in fact, received two convictions for shoplifting in the U.S. and also learned that she had used a false name for part of the time she was in the U.S. The hearing was therefore adjourned to provide notice to the Minister, to allow the respondent to make representations on the question of exclusion and to obtain additional information about the applicant's U.S. immigration history and convictions.", "II.", "The RPD's Decision"], ["[8]", "Following two additional days of hearing, the RPD issued the decision that is the subject of the present application for judicial review.

It focussed in this regard not on the shoplifting but rather on the applicant's use of the forged passport and of the fraudulent Khachirova identity when she was arrested and convicted of shoplifting and held that such actions would correspond to the offences set out in paragraph 57(b)(i) and subsection 403(1) and (2) of the", "Criminal Code of Canada", ", RSC 1985, c C-46, [", "Criminal Code", "] - namely forgery of or uttering a forged passport and identity fraud.

It thus held that the first branch of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> inquiry was satisfied."], ["[12]", "In terms of the other <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> factors, the RPD focussed on four potentially aggravating factors, namely, the applicant's lack of candour about her convictions in her PIF, her use of a real person's name in connection with her first shoplifting conviction, her provision to Citizenship and Immigration Canada of a police clearance from Pennsylvania in her own name even though she was aware she had a criminal record under her assumed Khachirova name and, finally, the fact she had purposefully lied to the police in 2002 about her identity to avoid a conviction in her own name when she no longer had any need to use the Khachirova name as she had, by then, received her own passport. Based on these aggravating concerns as well as the nature of her actions and their correspondence to the crimes set out in paragraph 57(b)(i) and subsection 403(1) and (2) of the", "Criminal Code", ", the Board concluded that the applicant had committed a serious non-political crime outside Canada and was therefore excluded from protection under section 98 of the", "IRPA", "and Article 1F(b) of the", "Refugee Convention", "III.", "The Impact of the Decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [13]", "In its recent decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada made comments regarding the test applicable to the determination of serious criminality under section 98 of the", "IRPA", "and Article 1F(b) of the", "Refugee Convention", "that are determinative in this case."], ["[14]", "Prior to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , as my colleague Justice de Montigny recently noted at para 32 of", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], \"... the presumption that a crime is 'serious' under Article 1F(b) if, were it committed in Canada, it would be punishable by a maximum of at least 10 years' imprisonment, was consistently applied by the Courts ...\". The Supreme Court, however, significantly nuanced this proposition in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . There, the majority stated as follows regarding how the seriousness of a crime is to be ascertained:"], ["[62] The Federal Court of Appeal in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> has taken the view that where a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada, the crime will generally be considered serious. I agree.", "However, this generalization should not be understood as a rigid presumption that is impossible to rebut. Where a provision of the", "Canadian Criminal Code", ", R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, has a large sentencing range, the upper end being ten years or more and the lower end being quite low, a claimant whose crime would fall at the less serious end of the range in Canada should not be presumptively excluded. Article 1F (b) is designed to exclude only those whose crimes are serious. The UNHCR has suggested that a presumption of serious crime might be raised by evidence of commission of any of the following offences: homicide, rape, child molesting, wounding, arson, drugs trafficking, and armed robbery", "(G. S. Goodwin-Gill, The Refugee in International Law (3rd ed. 2007), at p. 179). These are good examples of crimes that are sufficiently serious to presumptively warrant exclusion from refugee protection. However, as indicated, the presumption may be rebutted in a particular case. While consideration of whether a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada is a useful guideline, and crimes attracting a maximum sentence of ten years or more in Canada will generally be sufficiently serious to warrant exclusion, the ten-year rule should not be applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized, or unjust manner.", "[Emphasis added]"], ["[15]", "In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice de Montigny set aside a decision of the RPD that, like the decision in this case, was premised in large part on the fact that the maximum punishment for the crimes in question was a sentence of more than ten years' imprisonment. He wrote as follows:"], ["[48] At the end of the day, however, the most egregious error of the Board member was her failure to take into account what the Supreme Court considered a critical factor in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , namely the wide Canadian sentencing range and the fact that the crime for which the Applicant was convicted would fall at the less serious end of the range. This consideration was quite relevant in the case at bar: the Canadian sentence for fraud over $5,000 has a large sentencing range (0 to 14 years), and the Applicant's crime - fraud of $50,000 with a 10 month sentence -", "prima facie", "falls at the low end of this range. The wide sentencing range and the Applicant's low actual sentence (not only was the actual sentence only two years but it was suspended and the only jail time was 165 days pre-trial custody) were clearly a most relevant factor in determining whether the crime was serious."], ["[49] On that basis alone, the decision of the Board ought to be quashed and the matter returned for reconsideration by a different panel of the Board."], ["[16]", "The Board's reasoning in this case evinces the same problems. Here, in assessing seriousness, the RPD looked only to the maximum potential sentences and, indeed, erroneously stated that both crimes were indictable offences."], ["[17]", "In fact, the offence of identity theft, created by section 403 of the", "Criminal Code", ", is a hybrid offence, in respect of which the Crown may elect to proceed either by way of indictment or by way of summary conviction.

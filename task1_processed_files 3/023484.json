Not doing so constituted a breach of procedural fairness. In the present matter, the issues raised by the Immigration Officer are not related to the sufficiency of the evidence but to the credibility of the documents, particularly those emanating from the Employer. This seems apparent given that the Case Analyst, who goes through numerous similar applications, first stated that the supporting documents appear sufficient. The Immigration Officer did not believe the Employer, and she was not convinced that the Applicant was actually working for the Employer. In fact, the Immigration Officer discredited the Employer in her GCMS notes, adding that certain elements of the second reference letter were not in the first letter and that this calls into question the content of the letter.

Second, should this Court be satisfied that the Immigration Officer's concerns indeed related to the veracity of the evidence, it must determine whether the Immigration Officer should have provided the Applicant with a meaningful opportunity to respond to these concerns.

As the GCMS notes indicate, on January 21, 2013, the Case Analyst completely reversed its positive assessment of the Applicant's file after having consulted unidentified materiel that revealed that the Employer was being (or had been) investigated by the CBSA and that its address had been flagged as a \"problem address\".

La Cour a la nette impression qu'un nuage sombre planait au-dessus de l'employeur. Comme il ressort des notes du SMGC, le 21 janvier 2013, l'analyste de cas a opéré un revirement complet de son analyse positive du dossier du demandeur, après avoir consulté des documents non identifiés selon lesquels l'employeur était (où avait été) l'objet d'une enquête menée par l'ASFC, et que son adresse avait été signalée comme étant [traduction] « une adresse problématique ».

Ainsi, il semble évident que l'agente d'immigration n'a pas cru les lettres de l'employeur, fort probablement en raison des notes concernant l'employeur que l'analyste de cas a rédigées antérieurement, en janvier.

L'agente d'immigration a relevé que certains des renseignements contenus dans la seconde lettre [traduction] « ne faisaient pas référence à la lettre du 17/06/2012, et remettaient en question le contenu de la lettre de recommandation ». Premièrement, je trouve étrange qu'une agente d'immigration demande des renseignements supplémentaires à un demandeur et une fois qu'elle les reçoit, elle utilise lesdits renseignements contre le demandeur, et déclare qu'ils ne figuraient pas dans la première lettre.

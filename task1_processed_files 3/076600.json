Their daughter, Maryam, is five years old and is a Bahraini citizen. The family are Shia Muslims and for several years lived in Bahrain, where Mr. Ameeri ran a business, importing pistachios from Iran. They fled the country for Canada in 2011, following the alleged murder of two of their friends by government security forces and an apparent upsurge in violence against Shia Muslims that accompanied general civil unrest. Upon arriving in Canada, the applicants claimed refugee protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[2]", "The applicants claimed that they were at risk due to the turbulent situation in Bahrain and, more specifically, that Mr. Ameeri would be harmed by Mr. Adel Flaifel, the former Bahraini head of state security, if Mr. Ameeri were to return to Bahrain.

First, the Board did not believe that Mr. Ameeri faced a threat from Mr. Flaifel. Next, the Board reasoned that Ms. Nazari-Nafouti, while perhaps unable to return to Bahrain with her family, could nonetheless return to Iran and would not be exposed to risk there within the meaning of section 96 and 97 of the", "Immigration and Refugee Protection Act", ", SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA or the Act]. The Board also concluded that the possibility that she would be separated from her family did constitute persecution and that, more importantly, there was no evidence that Mr. Ameeri and Maryam could not return to Iran. On this point, the Board noted that Mr. Ameeri was of Iranian ethnicity and that he did not appear to have attempted to obtain the right to live permanently in Iran with his wife. Thus, the applicants had not demonstrated that permanent family separation was inevitable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "In this application for judicial review, the applicants seek to set aside the Board's decision, arguing that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "1.

The Board failed to address the risk that Mr. Ameeri and Maryam face as Shia Muslims if returned to Bahrain and in limiting its risk analysis to that from Mr. Flaifel. The applicants argue in this regard that even if the Board did not believe that Mr. Ameeri was threatened by Mr. Flaifel, it was nonetheless under an obligation to assess the risk that Mr. Ameeri and his daughter might face as Shia Muslims of Iranian descent, if returned to Bahrain, as there was substantial evidence before the Board that indicated that Shia Muslims are being persecuted in Bahrain;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "4.

In terms of the first exchange between Mr. Ameeri and Board Member, the transcript demonstrates that Mr. Ameeri's testimony was hard to follow and that he wandered in answering questions. Thus, intervention by the Board Member was both required and reasonable in order to focus Mr. Ameeri's answers. In the impugned passage, the Board Member did nothing more than attempt to provide such focus and did not limit the applicant's testimony. Accordingly, this exchange does not demonstrate a denial of procedural fairness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "The second two exchanges centered on Ms. Nazari-Nafouti's claim that she could not return to Bahrain. The Board accepted that this was the case in its decision. Accordingly, these alleged denials of procedural fairness do not provide the basis for intervention as the Board accepted the applicants' evidence on this point. Thus, there was no violation of procedural fairness in this case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Did the Board err in failing to find that Maryam and Ms. Nazari-Nafouti would be subject to persecution or \"cruel and unusual treatment\" by reason of their permanent separation?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "The applicants secondly argue that the RPD erred in failing to conduct an independent assessment of Maryam's claim and erred in failing to find that permanent separation of Maryam and her mother would constitute persecution, within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA or,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's case, also cruel and unusual treatment, within the meaning of section 97 of the Act.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "As the respondent rightly notes, there is no evidentiary basis for this argument as the applicants failed to lead any credible evidence to establish that they were likely to be permanently separated. The only evidence somewhat related to this point in the record before the Board was a statement in the United States Department of State Report on Iran that \"[w]omen cannot directly transmit citizenship to their children or to a non-Iranian spouse.\" This falls woefully short of establishing that Mr. Ameeri and Maryam could not return to Iran. Thus, there was no evidence before the Board to show that the family would be permanently separated. As the RPD noted at para 12 of the decision, \"[Mr. Ameeri] is of Iranian ethnicity and there is no indication that the [applicants] have made contact with the appropriate authorities with a view of obtaining the appropriate documentation so the family can live legally and as normal as possible together in Iran. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "In the absence of any proof that the family would be permanently separated, the Board's failure to consider whether such possibility might amount to persecution or to cruel treatment is not unreasonable. Simply put, there is no need for the RPD to consider theoretical issues that do not arise on the facts of the case before it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Did the Board err in rejecting Ms. Nazari-Nafouti's claim that being returned to Iran would contravene her rights under section 96 and 97 of the IRPA due to restrictions placed on women in that country?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "The same may be said of the applicant's next argument. While it might be possible in an appropriate case for a female refugee claimant to successfully argue that being returned to a country where there is forced adherence to strict Islamic codes not espoused by the claimant constitutes \"persecution\" within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA or \"cruel treatment\" within the meaning of section 97 of the Act (see e.g.", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), this is not such a case. Here, the only real basis advanced by Ms. Nazari-Nafouti for refugee protection surrounded her claim that being returned to Iran would result in permanent separation from her husband and daughter. She had lived in Iran for a number of years and adhered to the cultural norms there, without complaint. The following excerpt from the transcript demonstrates that the basis for her claim centred on the belief that she would be permanently separated from her family:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "MEMBER:", "When did you last live in Iran?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "INTERPRETER:", "Last live?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "MEMBER:", "Yeah. When was the last time you resided in Iran permanently?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "CLAIMANT (MS. NAZARI-NAFOOTI):", "What do you mean? It means that I went for visit or I was living?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "MEMBER:", "No, I just said, when was the last time you permanently lived in Iran?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "CLAIMANT (MS. NAZARI-NAFOOTI):", "I believe it was 2006. I was pregnant at that time.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "MEMBER:", "All right. And after 2006, did you ever return to Iran to visit?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "CLAIMANT (MS. NAZARI-NAFOOTI):", "Yes.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "MEMBER:", "How many times?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "CLAIMANT (MS. NAZARI-NAFOOTI):", "I think it was two times, two or three times.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "MEMBER:", "And the last time you went back for a visit was when?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "CLAIMANT (MS. NAZARI-NAFOOTI):", "I believe it was November, around November or December 2010.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "MEMBER:", "Okay. And when you were last there, when you last lived there permanently about 2006, why do you think, if you were required to return today, that your life would be at risk?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "CLAIMANT (MS. NAZARI-NAFOOTI):", "Actually it's not like that, you know. I wasn't, you know, Iranian authorities, they weren't after me. It doesn't mean that if I go to Iran and I arrived to Iran airport, they going to arrest me. But, if I can't even do anything in Iran, I can't go to party, I can't - you know, always the are watching me and they are supervising me. The main, main risk for me is this thing. If I go back to Iran, I can't go with my daughter and my husband. I have to go by myself. And it's the big risk for me, you know. I can't.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "Once again, in the absence of evidence supporting the argument, the RPD was not required to consider a theoretical issue that did not arise on the facts of this case. Thus, on this point as well, its decision is reasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Did the RPD err in failing to address the risk that Mr. Ameeri and Maryam face as Shia Muslims if returned to Bahrain?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "Turning, finally, to the basis for setting this decision aside, as noted, the RPD analysed only the risk to Mr. Ameeri posed by Mr. Flaifel and found there to be no such risk as it did not believe that Mr. Flaifel had threatened Mr. Ameeri in the past. However, the Board did not go on to assess whether there was an independent risk to Mr. Ameeri and, through him, to Maryam by reason of their profiles as Shia Muslims of Iranian descent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "There was substantial evidence before the Board regarding the risk to Shias in Bahrain, and the country documentation reveals a picture of religious tensions which have intensified recently. The country's ruling monarchy is Sunni and historically there has been discrimination against the majority Shia population. However, that discrimination has increased in severity since the Arab Spring. While activists and journalists appear to be the greatest risk, the country documentation contains numerous references to the arbitrary arrest, detention and torture of male Shia as well, apparently motivated simply by their ethnicity and religious beliefs. The Board failed to analyze this risk and in so doing committed a reviewable error.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "The RPD has a duty to fully assess risks raised by an applicant's profile or circumstances (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 745-6, relying on the statement in the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees'", "Handbook on Procedures and Criteria/or Determining Refugee Status", "that, \"[I]t is not the duty of a claimant to identify the reasons for the persecution. It is for the examiner to decide whether the Convention definition is met; usually there will be more than one ground\". The RPD failed to discharge that duty in this case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "Thus, the Board's failure to consider the risks facing Mr. Ameeri and Maryam in Bahrain as a result of their ethnicity is a reviewable error which must result in the decision being set aside as a decision is unreasonable if it fails to address an issue that must be addressed (see e.g.", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "What is the appropriate remedy?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "Although I have treated each risk raised by the applicants separately, they were presented in an interdependent fashion by the applicants.

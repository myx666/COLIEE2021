He arrived in Canada on May 13, 2009. The applicant claimed refugee protection on the basis that he fears persecution in Fujian on religious grounds because he is a practicing Christian.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "The applicant stated that he first attended a church service at the suggestion of his childhood friend, Jun Lin, as a means of overcoming depression and drinking problems that he developed following a failed attempt to start a business. He first attended a service on April 6, 2008, and stated that he immediately became enthralled. Thereafter, he attended services every week. The applicant stated that the church was \"underground\" with practices not sanctioned by the Chinese government. As a result, the church took numerous precautions in order to ensure its secrecy and the safety of its attendees.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "On April 19, 2009, officers from the Public Security Bureau (PSB) raided the church service that the applicant was attending. He escaped before their arrival, \"thanks\" to a warning from a lookout. The applicant fled to a relative's home, afraid to return to his own home. As he hid, his wife informed him that PSB officers had visited his home looking for him. The applicant stated that the officers continued to visit his home and tell his wife that he had to face the consequences of having violated the law. As a result, the applicant and his wife decided that he could not return home. He decided to flee the country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The applicant managed to borrow $46,000 from relatives in order to pay a smuggler to get him a fake passport and fly to Canada, where he arrived in May 13, 2009. Since his arrival, his wife reports that Chinese authorities continue to look for him at his home.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Decision under review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "On September 23, 2010, the Board rejected the applicant's claim. The Board summarized its principal finding at paragraph 4 of its decision:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "¶4. There were credibility issues with respect to the unregistered service being raided and whether the authorities are interested in the claimant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "In particular, the Board found that the fact that the applicant was unable to produce any documentary evidence that the police were searching for him was fatal to his claim. The Board recognized that the documentary evidence revealed that summons or arrest warrants were not always left for suspects, but found that the weight of the documentary evidence indicated that the police were likely to have left some sort of summons at the applicant's home:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "¶7. Although the documentary evidence is mixed, it is reasonable to conclude that the authorities have concluded some investigation which gives rise to them stating that he was identified as a member of an underground church. Further, given that the authorities have allegedly continue [sic] to inquire about the claimant, it is reasonable to expect, given the documentary evidence, that an arrest warrant or summons would have been left with the claimant's family.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "In addition, the Board found that the applicant failed to show that any persecution of underground churches was occurring in the applicant's home province of Fujian. The Board reviewed the documentary evidence regarding the persecution of the estimated 50 to 70 million Christians associated with underground churches in China. The Board found that although smaller \"house churches\" like the one attended by the applicant do not officially need to register with the government, local officials nevertheless do disrupt home worship meetings. The Board found that the treatment of such underground churches is varied, with many urban underground churches limiting the size of their membership to avoid harassment, while those in rural areas could be quite large. The Board found that the police are more likely to target larger underground churches with stronger community and international connections. The Board recognized that the documentation indicates that members of unregistered churches face harassment and harsh punishment, including mistreatment and torture in custody, in some parts of China.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "With regard to the applicant's province of Fujian, the Board found that the evidence revealed that east coast provinces like Fujian have fewer reported incidents of persecution, but that this could indicate either that they are \"more open\" or that there are simply fewer reports made of the incidents that occur. The Board recognized that in 2006 a church in Fujian province was demolished, although there is no evidence as to why.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "The Board held, however, that because evidence of persecution incidents in areas more remote than Fujian province was available, the absence of such information regarding persecution in Fujian province indicating that such persecution was not occurring in that province:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "¶11. The panel is mindful of the caveat that the number of persecution incidents is likely to be much higher because of censorship in communications and even considered the possibility that not all information is available to commentators. Considering all these factors, the panel concludes that since there is a significant amount of information detailing very specific examples from areas much more remote and difficult to access than Fujian, which includes not only egregious examples of persecution such as arrests but also other forms of persecution such as fines, short term detentions, confiscation of materials, etc., that it is reasonable for the panel to expect to see persuasive evidence that groups such as the claimant's, which are small and not required to register, are being raided and individuals being jailed or facing other forms of persecution in Fujian province. The documentary evidence persuades the panel, based on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's unregistered house church was not raided and further supports the determination that the authorities are not seeking the claimant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The Board found that the documentation revealed that increasing numbers of Chinese, between 50 and 70 million individuals, belong to non-state-sanctioned churches, and that such underground churches are increasingly operating publicly without being bothered.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "Thus, while the Board accepted the applicant's claim that he was a practicing Christian, it found that he did not face persecution for that reason in Fujian province of China.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "LEGISLATION  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "Section 96 of the Act, grants protection to Convention refugees:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "96.

The evidence that the Board balanced was the applicant's testimony regarding the raid and police visits to his home, and the documentary evidence indicating the frequency and likelihood of police raids on underground churches in the applicant's home province of Fujian. Based on a review of this evidence, the Board found that certain churches were more likely to be raided than others. In particular, churches in certain areas of the country, churches that are larger, churches that have international connections, and churches that evangelize.

Nonetheless, the documentary evidence does lead to an inference that no such raid occurred", ". It leads to this inference, as the Board noted, for many reasons, including the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "1.", "There is a large discrepancy in the treatment of house churches in China", ". In some parts of the country house churches with large memberships meet openly with no objection, while in other areas, house churches with small memberships are targeted by the authorities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "2.

In this case, the Board chose to accept the independent documentary evidence over the applicant's testimony.

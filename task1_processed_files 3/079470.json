The duty to act fairly requires the visa officer to allow the applicants an opportunity to respond to any concerns the visa officer has with respect to the application, and to explain inconsistencies between the evidence (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). If there is an area which is central to the claim, and the visa officer finds the evidence implausible, the visa officer should put his concerns to the applicants and provide them with an opportunity to explain why the evidence is plausible.

In the case at bar, having regard to the words 'not brought forward by the applicant' used by Hugessen, J.A., to qualify the term 'extrinsic evidence', and his reference to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , I interpret the term 'extrinsic evidence not brought forward by the applicant' as evidence of which the applicant is unaware because it comes from an outside source. This would be evidence of which the applicant has no knowledge and on which the immigration officer intends to rely in making a decision affecting the applicant. While this would include information obtained from an outside party as in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , I fail to see why it would not also include evidence form a spouse obtained separately from the applicant, or other information in the immigration file that did not come from the applicant, of which the applicant could not reasonably be expected to have knowledge.\""], ["[19]", "The Court of Appeal reversed the Federal Court decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 193 N.R. 303 (F.C.A.)), and found that inconsistent statements by a spouse in a separate interview who is there to support the applicant's claim that there was a bona fide marriage are not \"extrinsic evidence not brought forward by her\" that officers are required to disclose."], ["[20]", "However, in this case, it doesn't matter whether the applicants actually had a right to be provided with an opportunity to explain inconsistencies between their version of events and the version of events tendered by the principal applicant's brother-in-law (in IMM-4613-05), because they were, in fact, provided with this opportunity. Furthermore, the officer's CAIPS notes indicate that the applicants were informed of his concerns and provided with an opportunity to respond.

The officer in this case stated that he considered all of the documentation provided by the applicants. He further stated that he has kept up-to-date on the political and security situation in Iraq by reviewing and referring to current media reports and country information reports from a variety of non-governmental organizations. Nothing in the excerpts cited by the applicants corroborated the credibility of their personal story.

Related Case"], ["[27]", "Moreover, according to the applicants, a related third case was approved by a different visa officer. The applicants submit that this third case is linked to the other two cases. The evidence of the applicant's niece, Jonfyef M. Yakowb, in the third case was that the applicant's niece believes her husband was kidnapped because they were helping her aunts, the co-related applicants."], ["[28]", "In my opinion, it is a faulty argument that their claim was refused while a third unrelated claim was approved by a different officer. As every case turns on its facts, the facts of the third related claim appear to be distinct from those at issue in this application, and the visa officer's decision was reasonable in this case.", "VIII. Interpreter"], ["[29]", "Lastly, the applicants submit that the visa officer erred by acting as decision-maker and interpreter. According to the applicants, the visa officer breached procedural fairness by not conducting the interview in either of Canada's official languages, and by questioning the applicant in Arabic without the use of an interpreter."], ["[30]", "The applicants submit that the visa officer did not follow protocol and breached procedural fairness."], ["[31]", "The visa officer's affidavit states the following:", "\"10.

There would be no need to do so. The preferable options, as the Manual suggests, is to conduct the interview in the applicant's language.

Conclusion"], ["[35]", "The officer committed no error in finding the applicants not to be members of the Convention refugee abroad class nor the Humanitarian-protected persons abroad designated class.

During the interviews, the applicants were informed of the visa officer's concerns and provided with an opportunity to respond.

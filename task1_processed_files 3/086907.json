An applicant is not entitled to a particular outcome, and it is not sufficient that an applicant's plight may invite sympathy. The onus is on the applicant to satisfy the officer that, in the applicant's personal circumstances, the requirement to obtain a visa from outside Canada in the standard manner would cause unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. The test cannot be whether Canada would be a more desirable place to live than the applicant's country of origin. Nor should this Court intervene only for the reason that it may have come to a different conclusion. As long as the officer properly examined the totality of the evidence and came to a defensible and acceptable outcome, her decision should be insulated from judicial review as the weight to be given to any particular fact remains entirely within her expertise.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "It is trite law that the proper test for assessing humanitarian and compassionate applications is whether the general obligation for all foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence from abroad would cause the applicant unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship.

More particularly, the applicant contends the Officer explained away the real stigma and hardship the applicant would face as a psychologically unwell divorced woman by arguing that she will not be alone in her suffering. The fact that there may be thousands of other women who are victims of social discrimination and hostility in Korea does not justify the refusal of her application; equally irrelevant, in the applicant's view, is the fact that insufficient evidence was submitted to demonstrate that the Korean government sanctions discrimination against divorced women.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "Having read carefully the reasons for the decision reached by the Officer, I cannot but conclude that the Officer was alive to the applicant's position. She acknowledged the abusive relationship Ms. Lee had left, the psychological scars she bears as a result, and the long healing process ahead of her. The Officer also recognized it was unfortunate that the sponsorship was withdrawn. But having regard to all the circumstances, she was nevertheless not satisfied that the hardship of having to obtain a permanent resident visa from outside of Canada in the normal manner would be either unusual and undeserved or disproportionate.

Nor was it irrelevant to take into consideration the facts that the Korean government does not countenance or condone societal discrimination, and that she would not be isolated in coping with these difficulties. The Officer also noted there was insufficient evidence to show that Ms. Lee would not have access to psychological counselling in Korea to aid in her recovery. Of course, none of these factors were sufficient or determinative, in and of themselves, in assessing her application. Nevertheless, they could certainly be taken into consideration to determine whether she would suffer unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship if required to apply for permanent residence from Korea.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "The psychologist's opinion on social conditions in Korea, while no doubt interesting and relevant considering his own background, could not bind the Officer.

However, these cases (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) are distinguishable in that they both dealt with H&C applications where the officer applied the PRRA test of risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "Finally, the applicant submitted that the Officer did not give sufficient weight to the Respondent's IP-5 Manual (", "Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds", "), which instructs officers to be particularly sensitive to cases where the spouse of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident leaves an abusive situation and, as a result, is left without an approved sponsor.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "Section 13.10 of that Manual states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Family members in Canada, particularly spouses, who are in abusive relationships and are not permanent residents or Canadian citizens, may feel compelled to stay in the relationship or abusive situation in order to remain in Canada; this could put them at risk. Officers are then urged to be particularly sensitive to such cases and to take into account a number of factors when assessing them, namely 1) information indicating there was abuse such as police incident reports, charges or convictions, 2) whether there is a significant degree of establishment in Canada, 3) the hardship that would result if the applicant had to leave Canada, 4) the customs and culture in the applicant's country of origin, 5) support of relatives and friends in the applicant's home country, 6) whether the applicant is pregnant, 7) whether the applicant has a child in Canada, 8) the length of time in Canada, 9) whether the marriage or relationship was genuine, and 10) any other factors relevant to the H&C decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "It is true that the Officer nowhere mentions explicitly the Manual in her reasons. Once again, however, a careful reading of her decision shows that she did take the suggested factors into consideration. Moreover, it has been held time and again that guidelines are not law, are not binding on the Minister or his agents, and do not create any legal entitlement in applicants who believe they have satisfied them (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). While they can be of assistance to the Court, they cannot fetter the discretion of an officer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "The applicant's final argument is that the Officer breached the duty of fairness in not providing the applicant with an oral interview. According to Ms. Lee, the Officer's written reasons contain several statements that amount to unverified assumptions. For example, the Officer assumes that because Ms. Lee's parents have supported her financially in Canada, it is reasonable to expect that they would continue to do so should she return to Korea and that they would also sustain her emotionally. In making that assumption, says the applicant, the Officer ignored her assertion that she felt uncomfortable with her parents during her month-long visit with them, for the very fact that they were upset over her divorce. It does not necessarily follow that the applicant's parents will continue to support her in Korea, where their daughter is stigmatized and shunned by society, in the same manner they do now when she is in Canada. Ms. Lee therefore argues that she should at least have had a chance to address the Officer's speculations and rebut her assumptions at an interview.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "Procedural fairness does not always require an oral hearing. As the Supreme Court recognized in", "Baker", "supra", ", \"[t] he flexible nature of the duty of fairness recognizes that meaningful participation can occur in different ways in different situations\" (at para. 33). The Court went on to state explicitly that an oral hearing is not a general requirement for an H&C decision.

The MNR therefore sent to the Applicant, Hugh Stanfield, demand in the form of a questionnaire under cover of a letter dated 27 August 2002, the letter containing the statement:", "\"Please be advised that a criminal investigation regarding the promotion of transactions of the type claimed on your income tax return has been undertaken. You are not under investigation at the present time but we wish to advise you that any information submitted may be provided to our Investigations Division for review.\"", "The letter did not say that the recipient would never be under investigation. This uncertainty concerned Mr. Stanfield, who wondered why he should hand over information to the Minister if he was in fact under investigation. He was concerned enough that he sought review of the Minister's demand."], ["[2]", "Mr. Stanfield, in due course, was joined by other concerned taxpayers who now make up the Applicants in this judicial review proceeding.

While taxpayers are statutorily bound to co-operate with CCRA auditors for tax assessment purposes (which may result in the application of regulatory penalties), there is an adversarial relationship that crystallizes between the taxpayer and the tax officials when the predominant purpose of an official's inquiry is the determination of penal liability. When the officials exercise this authority, constitutional protections against self-incrimination prohibit CCRA officials who are investigating", "ITA", "offences from having recourse to the powerful inspection and requirement tools in ss. 231.1(1) and 231.2(1). Rather, CCRA officials who exercise the authority to conduct such investigations must seek search warrants in furtherance of their investigation.\"", "In essence, taxpayers must cooperate with Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (the \"CCRA\") audits for tax assessment purposes, even though the result may be a regulatory penalty, but an adversarial relationship crystallizes when the predominant purpose of the inquiry is the determination of a penal liability: when this line is crossed the CCRA no longer has recourse to inspection and requirement procedures under the", "Income Tax Act", ", but must obtain search warrants in order to further their investigation."], ["[4]", "On the present motion the Applicants seek additional documents on which to cross-examine further on an affidavit sworn on behalf of the Crown and that the Crown's deponent re-attend for further cross-examination to answer questions already asked and to answer proper questions arising out of any additional documents which are ordered produced."], ["[5]", "The result of this motion, based upon the", "Jarvis", "case and the law is mixed success. In order to demonstrate the route to rulings for and against the Applicants I begin with background commencing in the spring of 1999, for there are many events, well before a formal delivery of a file by the Audit branch of the CCRA to the Investigations Division, which might bear on a crystallization of an adversarial situation and preclude information gathering under sections 231.1(1) and 231.2(1) of the", "Income Tax Act", ", forcing the CCRA Investigations to proceed by way of search warrant in order to gather information for prosecution purposes.", "BACKGROUND"], ["[6]", "The submissions of the Applicants are based on events going back to tax loss arrangements in 1998. The involvement of the Respondent's witness, Ms. Deanna Pumple, the deponent of a 31 October 2002 affidavit which is relied upon by the Minister in opposing the judicial review application, is as an auditor. Ms. Pumple worked with the Tax Avoidance Division of the Verification and Enforcement Division of CCRA, which is apparently an audit section. The initial audit related to a 1998 tax loss arrangement referred to the Union Cal Trading Joint Ventures which were, as I have already indicated, currency and commodity transactions straddling a year end, are described by Ms. Pumple as vehicles to realize losses and defer recognition of income. She audited about three quarters of the Applicants."], ["[7]", "Apparently because of the connection between 1998 tax loss arrangements and 1999 tax returns, Ms. Pumple decided, sometime in the first part of 2000, to review the tax returns of those Applicants whom she was auditing, for the 1999 taxation year. This subsequently became a national project, rather than merely one done by Ms. Pumple in the Vancouver Island taxation services office. Thus other CCRA auditors also became involved in reviewing the 1999 tax returns of the Applicants."], ["[8]", "In April 2001 members of the CCRA Investigations Division met with the auditors from the Tax Avoidance Division, who included Ms. Pumple, to share information. As a result of a request by the Investigations Division Ms. Pumple referred various of her files to them and created a chronology for their assistance. At about this point the Investigations Division instructed the Tax Avoidance Division to cease auditing the 1998 and 1999 returns."], ["[9]", "The Investigations Division was involved for the purpose of evaluating whether the Applicants were involved in criminal activities. From time to time Ms. Pumple received requests for and forwarded additional information to the Investigations Division.

He was a member of what was called the Global Prosperity Group Team in the Investigations Division, working directly with its members, although he held himself out as belonging to Tax Avoidance. From the transcript of the examination of Ms. Pumple it is clear that he at least acted as the liaison person between the Tax Avoidance and the Investigations groups."], ["[11]", "About a year after the Investigations group became involved, March 2002, the Investigations Division told the Tax Avoidance Division to recommence the audit for 1998, the result being a Notice of Reassessment for 1998."], ["[12]", "In July 2002 Investigations told Tax Avoidance to recommence auditing the Applicants for their 1999 and 2000 taxation years. This resulted in Ms. Pumple and various other Tax Avoidance officers sending out letters and attached questionnaires, the subject of the present judicial review application."], ["[13]", "Between June 2002 and September 2002 there was a regular exchange of information between Investigations and Tax Avoidance. Examples of the exchange of information show up in a series of emails from Mr. Kuhn, the liaison person between Investigations and Tax Avoidance, instructing CCRA officers as to the audit approach to be taken upon resumption of audit activities. As an example of the interrelationship of the two groups, at the time of the cross-examination of Ms. Pumple, in January of 2003, the tax returns of many of the Applicants were still in the possession of Investigations."], ["[14]", "The Applicants set out in the material that Ms. Pumple did not always have personal knowledge and this is reasonable enough given the magnitude of the project. To inform herself Ms. Pumple communicated with other Tax Avoidance officers. She determined where various of the tax returns were located. However she did not make any inquiries of the head office of the CCRA or speak with anyone at Investigations. Counsel for the Applicants goes on to make a case that Ms. Pumple had really only limited knowledge, for she knew nothing about internal communication within the CCRA, the communications path between head office and Investigations, the concept of a tax shelter, and the role of Investigations. She was unable to speak for Investigations. Further, Ms. Pumple did not prepare the letter or questionnaire at issue, although she did sign the letter. The discovery does indicate that Investigations had some input in drafting the letter, specifically I think the advice of the criminal investigation and that the recipient was not at that point under investigation. From the point of view of the Applicants, the evidence of Ms. Pumple and the documents that she brought with her to the cross-examination do not, in their view, make clear the predominant purpose of the investigation itself, the concept of predominant purpose demonstrating, in some instances, in the crystallization of an adversarial relationship. Thus the Applicants submit they are unable to determine both whether an adversarial situation has crystalized and the clear line between provision of information in an audit setting and the right to refuse information, except as against a search warrant, in an investigation setting."], ["[15]", "Ms. Pumple also refused to answer a number of questions put to her on cross-examination as irrelevant."], ["[16]", "The result of the refusals as to documents and questions is the present motion.

However, Rule 91 may not be used to expand production of documents on judicial review so that the process becomes similar to discovery of documents in an action. Certainly a court must have before it sufficient documents to provide an adequate factual record. It is in the interest of justice that production not be limited so as to handicap an applicant. However production of documents in a judicial review setting ought not to be such as to expand the intent of judicial review as a relatively speedy remedy. Rather, production is limited to what is required by relevancy, in the context of judicial review and as set out in the case law."], ["[19]", "By way of example, even in the case of an action, where there is full discovery of all relevant and produceable documents, such a broad request for documents, say that contain in a subpoena duces tecum, may come close to abusing the process of the Court."], ["[20]", "Examining further this concept of too broad a production of documents being abuse of process, I would refer to the views of Mr. Justice MacKay in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 103 (T.D.), at 107-108. There it concerned Mr. Justice MacKay that by describing and seeking documents too generally and too broadly in the subpoena duces tecum, a party was in effect on a fishing expedition. This use of a subpoena duces tecum was inappropriate. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Mr. Justice MacKay quashed two subpoenas which sought a range of documents similar to the range sought this instance.

Of course, as Mr. Justice MacKay went on to point out in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  making a further subpoena seeking documents described with greater particularity. Keeping in mind, as I have said, that production is limited to what is required by relevancy, determined in the context of judicial review and by the case law, the present denial of wholesale production of documents, by way of a Direction to Attend, does not bar the Applicants from making more limited and specific requests for documents.", "Relevance and the Scope of Cross-Examination"], ["[23]", "The concept of relevancy is more limited in judicial review than it is in an action.

In that case, at page 555, Mr. Justice Hugessen began with the proposition that cross-examination is not examination for discovery: it differs from examination for discovery in various particular aspects which he sets out as:", "\"a) the person examined is a witness not a party;", "\"b) answers given are evidence not admissions;", "\"c) absence of knowledge is an acceptable answer; the witness cannot be required to inform him or herself;", "\"d) production of documents can only be required on the same basis as for any other witness, i.e. if the witness has the custody or control of the document;", "\"e) the rules of relevance are more limited.\"", "At issue  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Frosst", "was relevance, an important aspect in the present instance.

In an action those issues are defined by the pleadings, but in an application for judicial review, where there are no pleadings (the notice of motion itself being required to set out only the legal as opposed to the factual grounds for seeking review), the issues are defined by the affidavits which are filed by the parties. Thus, cross-examination of the deponents of an affidavit is limited to those facts sworn to by the deponent and the deponent of any other affidavits filed in the proceeding.", "\"Over and above formal relevance, however, questions on cross-examination must also meet the requirement of legal relevance. Even when a fact has been sworn to in the proceeding, it does not have legal relevance unless its existence or non-existence can assist in determining whether or not the remedy sought can be granted.\"", "Important principles arise out of these passages. First, formal relevance is based on issues of fact, defined by pleadings in an action and by affidavits in judicial review; second, Mr. Justice Hugessen pointed out that in his view, cross-examination on an affidavit \"... is limited to those facts sworn to be the deponent and the deponent of any other affidavits filed in the proceeding.\", in essence requiring a factual basis for cross-examination, obtainable from any filed affidavit; and third, legal relevance governs in determining whether the remedy sought is available."], ["[24]", "Whether cross-examination is strictly limited to the facts sworn to in the total of the affidavits filed in a matter is of interest. Certainly, Mr. Justice Muldoon, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at 530-531, took a more expansive view, citing sound authority. He felt that the deponent of an affidavit ought not to be able to hide behind skilfully sculpted evidence, but the cross-examination should extend beyond the four corners of an affidavit to encompass \"Matters pertinent to the documentation of the issue in respect of which the affidavit was filed.\" (ibid page 531), that it should extend to collateral questions arising from answers and also matters upon which the witness could fairly be expected to have knowledge, relating to the principal issue in the proceeding, touched upon by the affidavit:", "\"The person making the affidavit must submit himself to cross-examination not only on matters specifically set forth in his affidavit, but also to those collateral questions which arise from his answers.

It may well be that from time to time the nature of the proceeding will mandate slightly fuller production of documents and of answers: here I have in mind particularly where the witness is really an agent of a party. To elaborate, to allow a lower echelon witness, who has very little knowledge of concepts, of what happened and of what is at stake, to hide behind a narrow affidavit, is improper. To allow such would encourage litigants, who in effect are relying upon the witness as agent, to produce a marginal witness. For example corporate and government litigants might be encouraged to produce as a deponent a witness with limited knowledge and involvement. To countenance such would not only foster injustice, but also waste the time and money of all concerned, including litigants, the public and the Court. However I shall now turn to a current decision which has expanded the scope of cross-examination on an affidavit."], ["[28]", "The final case to which I shall refer, as to the scope of cross-examination and production of documents, is", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), an unreported 6 December 2000 decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, docket A-52-00. At trial the judge took a very limited approach to cross-examination on an affidavit and production of documents, essentially limiting such to cross-examination within the affidavit and to a consideration of only the documents which were attached to the affidavit. The Court of Appeal held that previous dealings were relevant and that the deponent might be cross-examined on information which he could have obtained from a co-defendant. The Court of Appeal also required the production of booking notes and bills of lading with respect to previous shipments which, on a reading of the trial decision, unreported 21 January 2000 in docket T-1942-98, were not mentioned in the affidavit material and production of which was denied by the Motions Judge. In essence what the Court of Appeal has done in", "Stella-Jones", "is not only to broaden cross-examination on an affidavit so that it may extend to relevant matters well beyond the four corners of the affidavit, but also to broaden production of documents by requiring production of material related to previous dealings, being relevant documents clearly outside of the affidavit material itself.

Included in the factors to examine which may bear on determination of the one dominant purpose of the CCRA are:", "(a) Did the authorities have reasonable grounds to lay charges? Does it appear from the record that a decision to proceed with a criminal investigation", "could have", "been made?", "(b) Was the general conduct of the authorities such that it was consistent with the pursuit of a criminal investigation?", "(c) Had the auditor transferred his or her files and materials to the investigators?", "(d) Was the conduct of the auditor such that he or she was effectively acting as an agent for the investigators?", "(e) Does it appear that the investigators intended to use the auditor as their agent in the collection of evidence?", "(f) Is the evidence sought relevant to taxpayer liability generally? Or, as is the case with evidence as to the taxpayer's mens rea, is the evidence relevant only to the taxpayer's penal liability?", "(g) Are there any other circumstances or factors that can lead the trial judge to the conclusion that the compliance audit had in reality become a criminal investigation?", "Jarvis", "at 806-807)", "This list contains a broad range of factors and moreover is, as I have said, open-ended."], ["[35]", "If a question or a document might be relevant and proper on cross-examination, using my earlier analysis, and might reasonably go to establishing the predominant purpose of the Minister's inquiry, such questions are answerable and such documents are produceable.

As I read the transcript of the cross-examination of Ms. Pumple, who signed the 27 August 2002 letter, it is, as set out in that letter, that the Applicants are not presently under investigation, although \"... a criminal investigation regarding the promotion of transactions of the type claimed on your income tax return has been undertaken\". The 27 August 2002 letter is thus far from an assurance that the Applicants are not at risk of a very real criminal investigation.

In July of 2002 the Investigations Division instructed the Audit Division to recommence gathering information in respect of the 1999 and 2000 taxation years and at that point the Audit Division sent out letters and questionnaires, the questionnaire being a point to which I will shortly return.", "6. Between June of 2002 and September of 2002 there was a regular exchange of information and emails between the Investigations Division and the Audit Division as to the approach to be taken on resumption of audit activities.", "All of this reasonably raises alarm, on the part of the Applicants, that they may still be under investigation, or at least that there may be a clearly contemplated investigation and that for practical purposes there has been a crystallization of an adversarial relationship between the applicant taxpayers and the tax officials, with the predominant purpose of the inquiry being the determination of penal liability, once documents have been gathered from the Applicants by the Audit Division through the so-called cooperative approach with the taxpayers."], ["[38]", "Counsel for the Applicants urged a thoughtful reading of the questionnaire sent out by the CCRA with the 27 August 2002 letter. The letter itself calls upon the taxpayers to produce a very thorough and comprehensive package of documents and information. In effect it is a letter requesting books and records: the questionnaire clearly goes far beyond being a request for books and records, but seeks a good deal of information which either was clearly not covered in the extensive production request in the letter and indeed, looks for information which one might be hard pressed to justify merely on the basis of an audit. A thoughtful reading of the questionnaire can easily lead one to the conclusion that the questionnaire was not something dictated by the needs of and drafted by the Audit Division, but rather is a far more pointed and searching request for information which could well have bearing on the criminal investigation. Finally, and this has direct bearing on the provision of answers and production of documents well before June of 2002, Ms. Pumple did agree, in cross-examination, that the review by the CCRA of the 1998 taxation year was connected to an ongoing review of the taxation years 1999 through 2001, and that investigations undertaken by the CCRA dealt not only with the 1998 taxation year, but also with the 1999 through 2001 taxation years. Indeed, it is fair to say that investigations as to the 1998 taxation year were relevant to the subsequent three taxation years, all being a part of one investigation over a number of years.", "Applicants' Requests for Documents"], ["[39]", "Question 50", "in the 13 January 2003 transcript of the cross-examination of Ms. Pumple refers to a so-called principal file sought by way of the Direction to Attend. As I have indicated, the request in the Direction to Attend is too broad. The result could, in itself, be both a fishing expedition and a part of a full discovery of documents. However the cross-examination then proceeded, with the marking of a document at question 53 called \"Unioncal Trading Joint Venture Binder Index\", a document prepared by Ms. Pumple which describes what is contained in the principal file. The Defendant has refused to produce the principal file, even though acknowledging that the principal file is relevant to the extent of the 1999 and 2000 taxation years, but denying its relevance with regard to the 27 July 2002 letter."], ["[40]", "Either the document is relevant or it is not: one does not measure relevance in degrees along a scale. The file described by the index which has been produced may well provide background and a basis for the development of and the actual letter of 27 July 2002, information by which to test the predominant purpose of the actions of the Minister as carried out by the CCRA. Moreover, the file requested is apparently in Ms. Pumple's filing cabinet. Its production, as a relevant bundle of documents is justified, for while it may be outside of the four corners of Ms. Pumple's affidavit, it certainly would be indicative of a course of conduct on the part of the Minister and may well have bearing on the issue the Applicants bring to the Court, including the predominant purpose of the CCRA inquiries.

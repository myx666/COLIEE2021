Neron of the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the \"Board\"), dated July 24, 2002 (the \"Decision\") wherein the Board dismissed the Applicant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction because, at the time of marriage, Zhen Qi Guo (\"the Husband\") did not intend to reside permanently with Nong Sat Mui (the \"Applicant\") and the Husband entered into the marriage primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada to join his family. The Applicant requests an order quashing the Decision of the Board to dismiss the appeal and an order remitting the matter back for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.", "BACKGROUND"], ["[2]", "The Applicant is 33 years of age and is a Canadian citizen who was born in Vietnam. The Husband is 45 years of age and lives in Hong Kong. The Applicant and her Husband purport to have met through their mothers, who are friends, in May 1999. Both the Applicant and her Husband speak Cantonese, and that is how they communicate with each other."], ["[3]", "According to the Applicant, she and her Husband were in contact with each other starting in June of 1999. In April, 2000, the Applicant went to China to visit her future husband, who lived there at the time. Prior to leaving for China, the Applicant obtained a certificate of non-impediment, which indicated that she was single and free to marry. The Husband made a marriage proposal to the Applicant on April 10, 2000. She accepted and they were married the following day. Only a few people attended the wedding and no family members of the Applicant were present. The Applicant testified that her parents, relatives, and friends were in Canada and she intended to have an additional celebration when her Husband came to Canada."], ["[4]", "The Applicant applied to sponsor her Husband in May, 2000 and returned to China on March 23, 2002 to visit him. The Applicant testified that, during this visit, she lived with her Husband, helped him with his business, and engaged in pleasureful activities. The Applicant testified that she and her Husband have talked a lot about their future plans. They plan to save up money, start a business and have children. The Applicant feels that the length of separation has been a very difficult experience."], ["[5]", "The Applicant provided telephone bills, letters, postcards and photos in support of her sponsorship application before a visa officer (the \"Visa Officer\"). The Visa Officer refused the Applicant's sponsorship application. The Visa Officer concluded that the Husband married the Applicant for the primary reason of gaining admission to Canada and that he did not have the intention of residing permanently with the Applicant."], ["[6]", "The Applicant appealed the decision of the Visa Officer to the Board.", "VISA OFFICER'S DECISION"], ["[7]", "The Visa Officer asked the Husband about his family in Canada. He explained that his parents, one younger brother, and a younger sister were in Canada. Under questioning, he also explained that his brother-in-law sponsored his sister to come to Canada in 1992. She was the first member of his family to come to Canada. The Visa Officer asked the Husband whether his brother-in-law and sister were still together. The Husband replied that they were."], ["[8]", "The Husband explained to the Visa Officer that he and the Applicant married shortly after they saw each other during his wife's visit to China because they had known each other for a certain period of time and, through talking to each other, they had found they were compatible. The Husband found the Applicant to be a very agreeable person and his ideal of a wife. He described the Applicant as a very pleasant person, easy to get along with and very willing to help people, a very loving and kind person, very much a traditional Chinese woman, a good wife at home and a respectable lady when dealing with outside people."], ["[9]", "The Applicant testified that, at the beginning of their relationship, she and her Husband did not keep records of their phone conversations because they used phone cards, which they did not keep. They were not aware of the need to keep records of their conversations as evidence at that time, particularly since they then considered each other as friends and had not formed an intention to pursue a marital relationship. The Applicant started keeping records of her phone conversations later in the relationship, after they got married and upon the advice of a friend, so that she could provide documentary support for the sponsorship application."], ["[10]", "The Applicant indicated that she limited her written communication with her Husband because of her relatively weak reading and writing skills in Cantonese. The Applicant's sister-in-law had to help translate letters for her, and both the Applicant and her Husband indicated that having a third party involved detracted from the intimate nature of the process. As a result, most of their communication, both before and after marriage, occurred by telephone."], ["[11]", "The Visa Officer asked the Husband whether he had ever tried to immigrate to Canada before. He replied that he had applied to come in as a visitor but not as an immigrant. His brother needed a chef, and he had work experience as a chef. The Husband did not know what happened with that application because there was no follow up."], ["[12]", "The Visa Officer told the Husband that there was an allegation that he paid $30,000 to marry the Applicant. The Husband responded that this was ridiculous and disclosed that he used to have a relationship with another woman, prior to meeting his wife, and that she fabricated stories to make his life more difficult. The Visa Officer noted that he took into account the contents of a poison pen letter sent by the former girlfriend of the Husband, but gave the letter limited weight."], ["[13]", "The Visa Officer refused the application.", "DECISION UNDER REVIEW"], ["[14]", "The Board indicated that it considered all the evidence adduced at the hearing and found that the Husband did marry the Applicant primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada as a member of the family class, and did not have the intention of residing permanently with his sponsor in Canada. The Board concluded, pursuant to s. 4(3) of the former Immigration Regulations, that the Husband was excluded as a member of the family class and it dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction."], ["[15]", "The Board came to this conclusion by finding that the unexplained haste to marry, the discrepancies between the Applicant's interview with the Visa Office and the Applicant's testimony, and the lack of sufficient supportive evidence of on-going communications prior to the marriage indicated that the relationship was not genuine and was entered into by the Husband for immigration purposes and not with the intention of residing permanently with the Applicant. The Board noted that the contents of the poison-pen letter from the ex-girlfriend of the Husband did not influence the Decision. The Board did not find the Applicant and her Husband to be credible witnesses and, instead, found their testimony self-serving and contrived. The Board found some key discrepancies that the Board felt went to the essence of their marriage, such as when the Applicant and her Husband met and when they decided to get married. The Board also noted that the Applicant did not call her mother or her mother-in-law as witnesses at the appeal hearing. Instead, the Applicant and her Husband testified. The Board found that the Applicant's testimony and the documentary evidence were not sufficient to arrive at a decision favourable to the Applicant."], ["[16]", "The Board found the fact that the Applicant obtained a certificate of non-impediment in Canada prior to visiting China in April 2000 contradicted the Applicant's contention that she was not planning to marry when she visited on that occasion. Additionally, the Board did not find it credible that the Husband only proposed to the Applicant one day before the marriage. The Board found that the marriage was entered into for immigration purposes and because the Husband's family living in Canada had a compelling interest in having him immigrate to Canada.", "PERTINENT LEGISLATION"], ["[17]", "The pertinent legislation for the refusal of the Husband from admission into Canada as a member of the family class is subsection 4(3) of the Immigration Regulations, SOR/78-172:", "4.(3) The family class does not include a spouse who entered into the marriage primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada as a member of the family class and not with the intention of residing permanently with the other spouse.", "Bad faith", "4.

Because of this, it is imperative that a finding that a sponsoree does not intend to reside permanently with the sponsor be based on fact and not on inference, as appears to have been done in this case."], ["[27]", "In addition, the Board was obliged to provide specific reasons for rejecting evidence submitted by the Applicant.

In my view, the board was under a duty to give its reasons for casting doubt upon the appellant's credibility in clear and unmistakable terms.

Here, the panel justified its rejection of the applicant's assertion that political dissent was not tolerated in Guatemala by a selective and minimal reference to the documentary evidence. From what was pointed out to me, the evidence is overwhelmingly to the contrary.

An underlying theme raised by the Applicant and her Husband in their testimony before the Board on a number of occasions relates to their age. They indicated an intention to start a family and feel that they are running out of time to do this as they are both getting older.

For example, Campbell J. addressed this issue in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal held that when an applicant swears to the truth of certain allegations, a presumption is created that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. The Court held that a Board acts arbitrarily in choosing to disbelieve an applicant's testimony where there exists no valid reason to doubt the truthfulness of it.

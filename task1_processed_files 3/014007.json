On June 6, 2005, Mr. Hemant Bagwani, the General Manager of Mantra, applied to Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) for a positive Labour Market Opinion Confirmation, explaining that he required Mr. Randhawa's skills as an assistant cook specializing in North Indian cuisine to assist Mantra's head chef and train its staff. HRSDC confirmed the job offer and provided a positive Labour Market Opinion on July 5, 2005."], ["[3]", "On July 13, 2005, Mr. Randhawa applied to the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi for a work permit. On August 24, 2005, he attended an assessment interview."], ["[4]", "At the interview, the visa officer asked Mr. Randhawa questions about his sister in Canada, his education, and Indian cooking in general. With respect to cooking, Mr. Randhawa answered questions about Indian spices and kitchen hygiene. The visa officer asked questions about how to verify the freshness of chicken and about refrigerating meat. At the end of the interview, the visa officer advised Mr. Randhawa that she would not issue him a work permit because she was concerned that he would be unable to observe principles of hygiene. The job offer from Mantra listed as one of Mr. Randhawa's duties as \"maintaining high standards of hygiene and sanitation\". Accordingly, the visa officer advised Mr. Randhawa that she would keep his file open for 30 days and require that he complete a course in proper kitchen hygiene, at which time a final decision would be made following an interview at which Mr. Randhawa would be required to demonstrate that he was able to function with attention to proper hygiene in a kitchen environment."], ["[5]", "Mr. Randhawa enrolled in a Food Hygiene and Kitchen Operations course through the Dare Education Group from August 26, 2005 to September 8, 2005.

Mr. Randhawa answered every question."], ["[7]", "As indicated in the CAIPS notes, the visa officer concluded that Mr. Randhawa was unable to perform the duties required of an assistant cook:", "\"Conclusions: Despite his stated completion of a hygiene course, I am not satisfied that the applicant would be able to adequately observe principles of hygiene as required by his job contract. I also note that I checked with several other people in the office about his explanation as to how to test whether or not chicken is fresh (i.e., the explanation about the bloated chicken) and none of them had ever heard of it, either.

The Court concludes that the intense questioning of the applicant by the visa officer on his ability to \"maintain high standards of hygiene and sanitation\" was an unreasonable basis to form the conclusion that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is unable to perform the assistant cook job offered by the Mandra Indian restaurant in Toronto."], ["[14]", "Mr. Randhawa has seven years experience as an assistant cook.

Moreover, knowledge of what specific by-laws do and don't say was not a requirement of the job, nor was I assessing his knowledge of any regulations or systems. The ability to 'maintain high standards of hygiene and sanitation,' on the other hand, was a requirement, and he had not satisfied me that he could meet this requirement.

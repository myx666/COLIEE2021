She withdrew this claim in October 2007 and opted not to have a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) conducted. The Applicant voluntarily left Canada for Ethiopia in December 2007. Approximately one month later, the Applicant left Ethiopia for the Unites States. She did not make a refugee claim in the United States. In February 2008, the Applicant applied to extend a visitor's visa previously issued to her for entry into Canada. The request was denied."], ["[5]", "The Applicant made a second refugee claim in July 2008.

In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Supreme Court of Canada set out three issues to consider when determining if the Court should exercise this discretion.

The Applicant argues further that the destination of removal was the United States when the stay of removal was argued.

However, the existence of an adversarial context does not outweigh the other two issues set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above."], ["[14]", "These issues, the conservation of judicial resources and the importance of not departing of the courts role as the adjudicative branch, were discussed by Justice Luc Martineau in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. I agree with his conclusions and apply them to this case. Specifically, that a moot issue should not unduly take up judicial resources, that a re-determination order may establish a new category of persons in need of protection, that what was once a legal action of the government (the enforcement of the removal order) may become illegal afterwards simply by judicial dicta, and that a hearing of the judicial review in this instance may, in essence, amount to an indirect review of the merits of Justice Kelen's discretionary decision with regard to the stay."], ["[15]", "A further consideration is that I cannot grant a practical remedy in this case - while I may set aside the decision of the Officer, I cannot order a new PRRA be undertaken (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraphs 26-27). The purpose of a PRRA, as set out in paragraph 31 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, is to assess the risks before the removal, not after."], ["[16]", "In this case, the Applicant's daughter is a Canadian citizen and is not under any removal order.

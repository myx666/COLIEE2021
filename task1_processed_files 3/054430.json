He submitted that it was his family membership that made him a refugee. His claim was rejected because the RPD concluded that he could not base his claim on the problems experienced by Lopez Rosero before she left Colombia in 1999. In the opinion of the RPD, the applicant failed to establish that he personally was at risk of persecution in his country."], ["[4]", "The applicant argues that the RPD committed two errors.

He said that on December 1, 2003, Guideline 7, issued by the Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board, [see footnote 1] formalized a practice that had been in effect for some time, consisting, first, of foregoing hearing the claimant repeat to the RPD the facts set out in his or her PIF. This means that the hearing can move directly to cross-examination by the RPO and questions by the RPD. Only after that is completed does the claimant have an opportunity to present his or her own position and call any other evidence that he or she has."], ["[10]", "On the other hand, the claimant acknowledges that the RPD did not limit the time he was allowed for presenting that evidence, and he does not allege that the RPD was biased in this case.

For example, a defendant could argue that the burden of proof has been reversed if he or she were required to call evidence first: this might deprive the defendant of his or her right to call no evidence if, after hearing the plaintiff's evidence, the defendant was of the opinion that the plaintiff had not met his or her burden of making out a prima facie case."], ["[21]", "As Pelletier, J., said in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, the RPD is the master of its procedure. \"It is entitled to take economy of time into account in devising its procedures. It can equally direct which evidence it wishes to hear from the mouth of the witness and which it waives hearing\" (paragraph 28). However, the choices it makes impose duties on it that it would not otherwise have. For example, when it says that it does not need to hear a witness, it cannot then complain that it did not hear the witness. Accordingly, as Pelletier, J., said at paragraph 32, \"[t] he price of setting the agenda is to accept the responsibility for the items which are missed\". The judge then explained that in each particular case, the Court must consider whether the interaction that occurred during the hearing would fairly put the claimant on notice that the absence of further explanation would be prejudicial to his or her cause. Those comments relate to cases where there was no evidence, and not to the question of whether the evidence presented was sufficient."], ["[22]", "The applicant submits that, at paragraph 35 of that decision, Pelletier, J., questioned the validity of this practice, but that he could not have invalidated the decision in that case because Mr. Veres had not objected to the order in which evidence was presented."], ["[23]", "In my view, what Pelletier, J., said was that the practice of forgoing the examination-in-chief may well raise questions of fairness apart from the question of gaps in the evidence, but that those questions must be addressed by the Court when they are properly before it, that is, not only that there has been a timely objection, but also that the particular circumstances of the case warrant it."], ["[24]", "On this point, the Court notes that the applicant stressed the fact that a person who makes a claim for refugee protection is in a very vulnerable position. He or she is in a foreign place, often operating in a language other than his or her own, and this can give rise to major difficulties in practical and psychological terms. Obviously, each case will turn on its facts. That is precisely what is provided in paragraph 23 of Guideline 7, which reads as follows:", "\"The member may vary the order of questioning in exceptional circumstances. For example, a severely disturbed claimant or a very young child might feel too intimidated by an unfamiliar examiner to be able to understand and properly answer questions.

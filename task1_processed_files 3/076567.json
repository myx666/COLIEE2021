She had applied for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) which was also denied.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "Ms. Durrant sought to apply for permanent residency from within Canada on H&C grounds. Since arriving here the Applicant has integrated into life in Canada. Her application includes letters of support from her employers, colleagues, friends, landlord and pastor.

Except for her first six months in Canada the Applicant has been continuously employed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The Officer who decided the H&C application at issue here had also conducted the pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA). The Officer denied the H&C application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The Officer considered the evidence before her in reaching her decision.

One of the objectives of", "Dunsmuir", "was to liberate judicial review courts from what came to be seen as undue complexity and formalism. Where the reasonableness standard applies, it requires deference. Reviewing courts cannot substitute their own appreciation of the appropriate solution, but must rather determine if the outcome falls within \"a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (", "Dunsmuir", ", at para. 47). There might be more than one reasonable outcome. However, as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility, it is not open to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "ANALYSIS  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "The Applicant submits the H&C Officer:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "a. made findings based on errors of fact and speculation;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "b. overlooked the Applicant's letter shedding more light on her fear of returning to St. Vincent; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "c. ignored information in the application concerning her fear of returning to St. Vincent;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Did the Officer make findings based on errors of fact and speculation", "?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "The Officer found in error that the Applicant has four siblings in St. Vincent.

That the Applicant must sell a house or car or leave a job or family is not necessarily undue or disproportionate hardship; rather it is a consequence of the risk the Applicant took by staying in Canada without landing (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2001 FCT 7 at para. 14). <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "While the Officer's errors are problematic, they are not sufficient to justify reviewing the Officer's decision. Given the high threshold for humanitarian and compassionate consideration, I am not convinced the Officer would have concluded in favour of the Applicant on these grounds alone had her findings of fact been accurate.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Did the Officer overlook the Applicant's letter?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "The record contains an undated letter signed by the Applicant which amplifies on her experiences of abuse. The Applicant contends this letter was included in her updated submissions.

But, I cannot conclude it was a part of the file as the Applicant urges me to. The Applicant's file was assembled in various steps and submitted in parts at different times. The Respondent notes there is a second H&C application from the Applicant and that some documents do not necessarily correspond to the H&C application presented to the Court. It seems to me to be more probable the letter was not properly submitted in this application and therefore was never before the Officer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Did the Officer ignore information in the application concerning her fear of returning to St. Vincent?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "It is not uncommon for one Immigration Officer to determine an immigrant's PRRA and H&C application. As was done here, the assessment of one follows on the heels of the other. Ideally, the officer's familiarity with the file leads to better decisions. However, this Court has expressed concern on occasion from some adverse consequences of this practice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "One source of errors is in the assessment of risk factors between the two applications because the standard in each is different. PRRAs assess the risk of removal to a person's life or the potential for cruel and unusual treatment, whereas H&C considerations contemplated in section 25 of the", "Act", "concerns \"unusual or undeserved hardship\" which can include an element of risk on return.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "Mr. Chief Justice Allan Lutfy found in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 5, an officer should not \"close her mind\" to risk factors in an H&C application because they didn't meet the standard in the PRRA application.

He found at paras. 45 and 46:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "While it may be that violence, harassment and the poor health and sanitary conditions may not amount to a personalized risk for the purposes of a PRRA application, these factors may well be sufficient to establish unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "...What is crucial ...is that the assessment be done against the proper standard and criteria relevant to each analysis. In the context of an H&C application, Chapter IP 5 of the Immigration Manual published by Citizenship and Immigration Canada provides useful guidance. Unusual and undeserved hardship is described as a hardship \"not anticipated by the Act or Regulations\" or resulting of \"circumstances beyond the person's control,\" while disproportionate hardship is described as a hardship that \"would have a disproportionate impact on the applicant due to their personal circumstances. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "The initial H&C application in this case was received by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) in April of 2006.

I find this is a reasonable conclusion, even more so because of the wording of the October 16, 2008 letter. The letter states the CIC is offering the Applicant a chance to update her submissions, and it asks her to submit an updated application. Where the Applicant has new information, such as her place of employment, she provides an update.

Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "In their written submissions, the Applicants maintained that if the RPD committed a reviewable error in its approach to the issue of \"persecution,\" this would constitute an error that tainted its finding on the issue of state protection.

This is readily apparent from a review of paragraphs 25-31 of the RPD's decision, which appear at the end of its analysis. Although the RPD correctly identified (at paragraphs 9, 18, 28 and 31) the test to be applied in terms of \"adequate state protection,\" it failed to assess whether the various steps that have been taken and the various efforts that have been made by the state to provide such protection actually provide adequate protection, at an operational level, to people of Roma ethnicity in Hungary. This is evident from the language used throughout this part of its assessment, which includes phrases such as \"Hungary is making best efforts to offer state protection,\" \"serious efforts with adequate protection would be reasonably forthcoming\" and \"Hungary has undertaken serious and substantial efforts to ensure the future existence of the Roma and other minorities are protected. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "Nevertheless, the RPD's misunderstanding or misapplication of the \"adequate state protection\" test is not necessarily fatal in cases where, as here, the RPD also reasonably concluded on other grounds that the Applicants had failed to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection with \"clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect [them].\" In this case, those grounds were the failure of the Applicants to demonstrate that they had taken all objectively reasonable steps to avail themselves of state protection, and to provide compelling or persuasive evidence to explain their failure to do more than make a single attempt to seek protection from the police. As discussed below, it is clear from various parts of the decision that these were very important considerations for the RPD, and, indeed, provided an alternate basis for the RPD's decision. Having regard to the RPD's determinations on these points, its decision was not unreasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "It is settled law that absent a complete breakdown of state apparatus, it should be presumed that a state is capable of protecting its citizens (", "Ward", ", above, at para 57). Moreover, \"[t]he more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).

At paragraph 9 of its decision, after identifying the nexus issue of persecution, the RPD stated: \"As well, the Panel has also considered whether or not there is adequate state protection in Hungary, whether the claimants took all reasonable steps to avail themselves of that protection, and whether they have provided clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect them.\" At paragraphs 21 and 22 of its decision, after elaborating upon the latter two principles, the RPD characterized them as being \"directly on point\" in this case.

In short, the Applicants only made one attempt to report the incident and then failed to pursue the matter further.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[38]", "The RPD also noted that the police did not pursue the matter because the Applicants were unable to identify their assailants, who were disguised with scarves across their faces.

I disagree. In my view, the two cases are not materially distinguishable on this point. In", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant was questioned by police following the stabbing of her fiancé, whereas here, the police attended at the scene of the attack and then declined to take further action at that time and again the following day, because the assailants had fled and could not be identified.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[40]", "Relying upon", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Applicants also asserted that the police had an obligation to investigate the complaint, even if their assailants were unknown. I do not read that case as standing for such a stark proposition. The failure of the police in that case to further investigate the applicants' complaints in relation to attackers who could not be identified was simply a matter that the Court described as \"troubling\" at the end of its decision, and after identifying other grounds for setting aside the RPD's decision. However, if I am wrong in this regard, then I respectfully disagree. I am not aware of any obligation on the police in Canada to take further steps to investigate in these types of situations, and it is settled law that claimants for refugee protection are not entitled to greater protection in their home country than is available in Canada (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[41]", "Finally, the Applicants submitted that the police are the main agents of state protection in Hungary and that, in the absence of evidence that other sources of state protection in that country actually provide an adequate level of protection, the RPD erred by basing its state protection finding on the Applicants' failure to attempt to access state protection from those other sources (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[42]", "In my view, this proposition is somewhat in tension with the well settled obligations on applicants for refugee protection to (i) provide clear and convincing evidence that they are unlikely to be able to avail themselves of adequate state protection if they return to their country of origin; and (ii) demonstrate that they took all objectively reasonable efforts, without success, to exhaust all courses of action reasonably available to them, before seeking refugee protection in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[43]", "In any event, as mentioned above, in reaching its conclusion on state protection, the RPD twice stated that the Applicants did not ask to speak to a police supervisor, did not go to a different Miskolc police station, did not complain to the local Roma self government about the lack of police assistance and did not seek protection from any other authority.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[44]", "The failure to seek additional protection from the police distinguishes this case from the various cases in which the RPD's conclusion appears to have turned largely upon the failure of the applicants to seek protection from other sources of protection (see e.g.,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 46;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[45]", "The Applicants did not provide a compelling or indeed any reasonable explanation for failing to take any of these steps with respect to the single incident in December 2008 in which they personally were allegedly persecuted and did not receive adequate state protection.

No evidence was adduced to suggest that this was not an adequate response. With respect to the attack that occurred in December 2008, the police did attend on the scene and cause the masked assailants to flee before inflicting any serious injuries on any of the Applicants.

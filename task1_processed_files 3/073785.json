Bodum thus argues that the use, for example, of \"French press\" by Hario in 1985 and the use of the term by BonJour in the early 1990s, cannot go to invalidating the registration.

The decisive question was whether the design was entitled to copyright protection, and this turned on when the design was created. If it was created after legislative changes were made on June 8, 1988, copyright would apply. The Plaintiff argued that under s. 34(3)(a) of the Copyright Act, copyright is presumed to exist in an infringement action and the Defendant (which had introduced no evidence on point) bore the onus of rebutting the presumption (para 17). By contrast, the Defendant argued that the date of the design's creation was a fact material to the Plaintiffs' case and the Plaintiff had an obligation to adduce evidence proving it, which had not been led (para 19). The Defendant asked the Court to draw an adverse inference based on the Plaintiff's failure to introduce such evidence. The Court provided the following analysis:"], ["[25] Thus, the question remains: When was the Mangrove design created? The plaintiffs allege that it was created in September 1988. However, they lead no evidence to support their contention. ...The evidence at trial only indicates that the design was created before January 11, 1989, that is the day when Richard Stoyles acquired the design from Ms. Iles at a trade show in Frankfurt, Germany."], ["[26] In my opinion, the failure to adduce evidence on such a material fact leaves it open to me to draw an adverse inference and come to the conclusion that the design was created prior to June 1988. It is a well established rule that an adverse inference may be drawn if, without reasonable explanation, a party fails to adduce evidence available to him which could have resolved the issue. The principle is enunciated in the following passage from Wigmore on Evidence:", "The failure to bring before the tribunal some circumstance, document or witness, when either the party himself or his opponent claims that the facts would thereby be elucidated, serves to indicate, as the most natural inference, that the party fears to do so, and this fear is some evidence that the circumstance or document or witness, if brought, would have exposed facts unfavourable to the party. These inferences, to be sure, cannot fairly be made except upon certain conditions; and they are also open always to explanation by circumstances which make some other hypothesis a more natural one than the party's fear of exposure. But the propriety of such an inference in general is not doubted. [Citations omitted]"], ["[107]", "The Court found that the Plaintiff could have called the designer as a witness, or introduced her evidence by way of commission or Letters Rogatory, and that it was also reasonable to expect the Plaintiff to have obtained information about the date of the design's creation when it obtained the rights.

It would also show that Mr. Kelly reviewed the minute books of The Athletic Club and did not find the NUANS search. These two obvious modes of verification cannot be faulted.

It is not even a document regularly introduced by the Applicant, the authenticity of which is spuriously contested by the Respondent. It was presented by the Applicant's counsel to the witness in the course of cross-examinations without prior notice, in an attempt to repair a perceived gap in its evidence. Even pursuant to an undertaking freely given, there are limits to a party's obligation to make enquiries and obtain information from sources outside its own organization to allow its opponent to verify or introduce evidence which it could have done independently. [emphasis added]"], ["[147]", "Prothonotary Tabib appears to have been concerned not to impose obligations regarding responses to undertakings that were too disconnected from the principles that guide cross-examination on an affidavit to begin with. This seems a legitimate concern to me: if a party cannot compel an affiant to inform herself or disclose documents in response to questions asked at the cross-examination itself, does an undertaking (or an implied undertaking through a response) suddenly transform the process into full-blown discovery? At the same time, the jurisprudence outlined above is clear that parties must honour their undertakings to respond to questions or disclose documents. The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case referred to (also decided by Prothonotary Tabib) provides the following analysis regarding how these competing considerations are to be balanced:"], ["[17] The Applicant goes on to argue that it is not required to accept the Respondent's \"bald\" assertions in response to the undertaking that there has been no transfer of goodwill or intellectual properties, that it is entitled to test those assertions and that in so doing, disclosure of the entire share purchase agreement would provide clarification or lead to further areas of inquiry."], ["[18]", "The language of the Applicant's argument is the language of discovery.", "Certainly, if this proceeding were an action and the question had been posed in discovery, I would agree that the entire share purchase agreement is relevant, as it may lead to a train of further inquiry on relevant issues, and that a request for its disclosure is a proper follow-up request."], ["[19]", "However, a cross-examination on affidavit is not a discovery, and an application is not an action. An application is meant to proceed expeditiously, in summary fashion. For that reason, discoveries are not contemplated in applications.

It did not introduce the NUANS search into evidence through its own affidavits, and did not request disclosure of the documents related to the 1997 incorporation through a Direction to Attend in advance of Mr. Kelly's cross-examination.

The proposed mark in question in that case was BABY DUCK CANADIAN CHAMPAGNE, and the applicant for registration had disclaimed the words \"Canadian champagne.\" The decision under review, which was upheld, was from the Trade Marks Opposition Board (see", "Jordan & Ste-Michelle Cellars  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  81 CPR (2d) 230 [", "Jordan & Ste-Michelle (TMOB)", "]) and states at paras 9-10:"], ["[9] ... [A]s s. 10 of the Act refers to the status of the mark prior to its adoption by the applicant and not to its status subsequent to its adoption, the evidence must establish that the mark CANADIAN CHAMPAGNE had become recognized in Canada as designating the kind, quality or place of origin of Canadian champagne as of the applicant's date of adoption, that is, the filing date of the applicant's proposed use application. In this regard, I am satisfied that the opponent has met this burden in the Browning affidavit and, in particular, para. 3 thereof, establishes that various companies have for many years utilized the words \"Canadian champagne\" to identify a particular type of wine which they have sold in Canada. Further, the Browning affidavit, which was not challenged or contradicted by the applicant, establishes that the words \"Canadian champagne\" have been generally accepted as identifying a sparkling wine of over 10% alcohol by volume and made primarily from Canadian-grown grapes and having an effervescence derived solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine in closed vessels. Thus, this description constitutes \"in ordinary commercial terms\" the type of wine which the applicant must be taken as intending to sell in Canada in association with its trade mark BABY DUCK CANADIAN CHAMPAGNE. In any event, the applicant has effectively conceded that Canadian champagne designates the kind of wares in association with which it intends to use its trade mark, having disclaimed the words \"Canadian champagne\" apart from the trade mark and having amended the statement of wares in its application to cover \"Canadian champagne\" which, having regard to s. 29(a) of the Trade Marks Act, constitutes a statement in ordinary commercial terms adopted by the applicant (effective as of the filing date of its application) of the specific wares in association with which it proposes to use its trade mark BABY DUCK CANADIAN CHAMPAGNE."], ["[10] With respect to the prohibition to the adoption of a trade mark under s. 10 of the Trade Marks Act, the trade mark sought to be registered must be either identical to the mark which designates the kind or quality of wares or must resemble that mark to such an extent as to be likely to be mistaken therefor. So far as the question of adoption of the trade mark is concerned, therefore, I do not consider that s. 10 could be relied upon to refuse a trade mark which, while confusing with a mark which designates the kind or quality of the wares, is neither identical to nor likely to be mistaken for such mark. Accordingly, s. 10 would not prohibit the adoption of a trade mark where the trade mark includes a word which either designates (or is likely to be mistaken for a mark which designates) the kind of wares, but where the trade mark as a whole would not be mistaken for such mark. In the present instance, I certainly do not consider that the applicant's trade mark BABY DUCK CANADIAN CHAMPAGNE would be likely to be mistaken for the mark CANADIAN CHAMPAGNE. Rather, the adoption by various Canadian wine producers of the words \"Canadian champagne\" in association with Canadian champagne would certainly alert the average consumer of the fact that there are various vintners who are producing Canadian champagne for distribution in Canada, such that the addition of the words \"baby duck\" to the words \"Canadian champagne\" by the applicant would, if anything, serve to distinguish the applicant's Canadian champagne from those of others, thereby avoiding any likelihood of the average consumer mistaking the applicant's Baby Duck Canadian Champagne in applied to Canadian champagne with the mark CANADIAN CHAMPAGNE in association with Canadian champagne."], ["[246]", "It is clear that the TMOB did not disregard the disclaimed portion of the mark in assessing it for compliance with s. 10. Rather, the Board considered whether there was a \"mark\" that had \"by ordinary and bona fide commercial usage become recognized in Canada as designating the kind, quality ... place of origin ... [etc] of any wares or services,\" and found that the words \"Canadian champagne\" met these criteria. It then assessed whether the trade-mark proposed for registration was identical to that mark, or \"so nearly [resembled] that mark as to be likely to be mistaken therefor.\" In making this assessment, the Board looked at the proposed trade-mark \"", "as a whole", ",\" including the disclaimed portion.

Rather, it merely cited the disclaimer as evidence that the applicant for registration in that case had itself acknowledged that the words in question had come to designate, through ordinary commercial usage, the kind of wares in association with which it intended to use the proposed mark."], ["[248]", "Upon review in this Court, Justice Cullen contrasted the prohibition set in s. 10 with that outlined in s. 9 of the Act, and took the view that disclaimers were relevant to the former but not the latter (", "Jordan & Ste-Michelle (FC)", ", above, at paras 7-13):"], ["[7] ...

A mere sampling here will suffice to show the particular emphasis of s. 9, namely, The Royal Arms, Crest, or Standard; the arms or crest of any member of the Royal Family; the arms, crest, or flag adopted and used at any time in Canada or by any province; the heraldic emblem of the Red Cross, the Red Crescent or the Red Lion; any scandalous, obscene or immoral word or device; \"United Nations\"; R.C.M.P."], ["[8] This is a strong prohibitive section and in my view anyone endeavouring to use such a mark as part of an overall trade mark would not be successful nor permitted to use the disclaiming s. 34. I cannot imagine any examiner/Registrar telling an applicant, \"The trade mark is acceptable but you must disclaim the right to the exclusive use of the words \"United Nations\", or \"R.C.M.P.\""], ["[9] That is not the case, however, with s. 10 and if it were there would be no rationale for s. 34. Clearly, there are words that can be disclaimed and CANADIAN CHAMPAGNE is almost a text book case. Prior to the passage of s. 34 I am satisfied the respondent (applicant) could not have secured the trade mark BABY DUCK CANADIAN CHAMPAGNE. With s. 34 it is conceded by counsel for the respondent in the course of his argument that there is a whole series of trade marks possible using the words Canadian champagne. As examples, I believe he mentioned the following possibilities: Calonna Premium Vintage Canadian Champagne, Andres Richelieu Canadian Champagne, Chateau-Gai Canadian Champagne, Jordan Gold Seal Canadian Champagne, and others."], ["[10]", "The arguments that s. 10 prohibits the adoption of the mark BABY DUCK CANADIAN CHAMPAGNE would certainly be applicable to CANADIAN CHAMPAGNE but not to the whole mark.

This was the basis of the Court's decision."], ["[251]", "The Court also observed that without the disclaimer provision, a trade-mark would not be able to include the term \"Canadian Champagne\" even if the mark as a whole would not be mistaken that mark. The Court suggested that this would be a consequence both of s. 12(1)(b) (see para 10) and s. 10 (see para 13). In my view then, for the reasons outlined above, disclaimers are not relevant to the s. 10 analysis. The question is simply whether there is a prohibited mark that is so similar to the proposed mark that the latter would be mistaken for the former."], ["[252]", "The discussion of disclaimers and their effect in", "Fox on Trade-Marks", "also seems at odds with the Respondent's position.

Section 10 functioned not to protect a hallmark or mark of quality or origin from commercial exploitation as a trade-mark, as suggested in", "Fox on Trade-Marks", ", but rather to protect existing commercial uses of the term \"halloumi\" from an attempted assertion of a monopoly on the rights to use the term through the registration of a certification mark (see also", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 161 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]: s.10 prohibits the adoption of a mark which has become generic \"in the collective minds of the appropriate relevant universe\")."], ["[260]", "The Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  considered but did not conclusively decide what constitutes a \"mark\" protected under s. 10. The question there was whether the word \"glen\" was such a mark, such that the appellant's trade-mark \"GLEN BRETON\" would be prohibited (if likely to be mistaken for \"glen\") by s. 10. The Scotch Whiskey Association argued that the common use of the prefix \"glen\" in the names of scotch whiskeys, such as Glenfiddich, Glenmorangie and Glenlivet, meant that this word had come to designate a kind of whiskey (scotch), and the appellant's proposed trade-mark thus violated s. 10 of the Act. Incongruously, the Association had argued that their members were entitled to use the word \"glen\" in their trade-marks because they were distillers of genuine scotch whiskey. Sexton JA provided the following analysis for the Court:"], ["[21] \"Mark,\" as it appears in section 10, is not defined by the Act. A \"trade-mark\" is defined in section 2, in part, as \"a mark that is used by a person for the purpose of distinguishing or so as to distinguish wares or services manufactured, sold, lease, hired or performed by him from those manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by others.\" The respondent argues that the term \"mark\" is clearly broader the term \"trade-mark,\" and suggests that the word \"glen,\" which forms part of many registered trademarks, can be considered on its own as a \"mark\" for the purposes of section 10."], ["[22] I agree with the first part of this argument, that a mark is not necessarily a trademark.", "Fox on Trademarks", "makes clear that a mark that is used for purely decorative or warehouse purposes will not be considered a trademark unless it has actually come to distinguish the trader of the goods (4th ed., looseleaf (Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2002) at 3-14 to 3-16). For instance, a sticker affixed to a ware to indicate to warehouse employees the date of manufacture would most likely not fall within the definition of a \"trade-mark.\" Likewise, a certification mark (a mark used to indicate that goods meet a defined standard, such as being \"organic\"), which may be used by many different traders, is a \"mark\" but not a \"trade-mark,\" as it is not unique to any particular trader."], ["[23] However,", "this court has not been referred to any authority for the proposition that a segment of a trademark can stand alone as a mark.

It was a segment of their trade-marks or trade names. The Applicant also alleges that generic (or descriptive) uses of the term \"athletic club\" have helped to establish it as a \"designator mark\" (and thus prohibited mark) under s. 10.

Commercial use of a term as a portion or segment of a trade-mark could not invest that term with the necessary \"designating\" force to become a prohibited mark under s. 10.

A number of these articles use the term \"athletic club\" in a descriptive sense in apparent reference to facilities devoted to sports and/or fitness, while others refer to the names of organizations or facilities that contained the words \"athletic club.\" While one can infer from the context that some of these references are to facilities that bear some resemblance to those of the Respondent, it is in most cases not possible to tell precisely what range of activities and services are offered by the facilities in question. Some refer to the sites of squash, tennis, or running events or the home facilities of the participants, without a clear indication of whether these are activity-specific or more general athletic and fitness facilities, while others more clearly refer to multi-purpose fitness facilities (see Applicant's Record at pp. 2549, 2585, 2593, 2630, 2643, 2645, 2646).

The precise degree of overlap or resemblance cannot be determined from the articles themselves. This evidence offers some support to the Applicant's position, but is far from conclusive on its own. It suggests that the term did have some descriptive meaning with the relevant audience at the relevant time, but it does not establish that there was truly an accepted definition or meaning of the term in the industry and what that meaning was.

In particular, the evidence shows that prior to 1997, several facilities surveyed by the Applicant were operating fitness facilities under business names that included the term \"athletic club,\" a number of such facilities were listed under relevant headings in the Yellow Pages, and the term was used descriptively (or generically) in newspapers to refer to such facilities."], ["[308]", "It may be that there were individual differences among these facilities.

In other words, the term \"athletic club\" had by 1997 become a generic term designating facilities similar to those operated by the parties in this matter, though the specific services and amenities offered at each may have varied. The term \"athletic club\" had therefore become, in my view, through ordinary and bona fide commercial usage, a mark designating a kind of services.

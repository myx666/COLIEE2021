Subsection 56(5) permits the applicant to adduce before the Federal Court, evidence in addition to that adduced before the Registrar. It has been clearly established in the jurisprudence that the applicant will not be prohibited from adducing evidence before the Federal Court simply because none was produced before the Registrar. This is especially so since pursuant to subsection 45(3), a registered owner of a trademark may have their trademark expunged for a \"failure to furnish any evidence\". In order to give registered owners a meaningful right of appeal, subsection 56(5) must be interpreted so as to enable a registered owner the same opportunity to file evidence before the Court as he or she had before the Registrar. This interpretation is also in line with the principle that the Federal Court be allowed to exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) at paragraphs 11 and 13 (C.A.)

Normally, where new evidence is adduced before the Court that would materially affect the Registrar's decision, the applicable standard of review is correctness (", "Molson Breweries, A  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) at paragraph 51 (C.A.)).

The proceedings are not meant to be contentious as is evidenced by the fact that the requesting party is not entitled to file evidence and is not entitled to cross-examine the registered owner on their affidavits ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 17). Similarly, the proceedings under section 45 do not impose a heavy burden on the registered owner. While a bald assertion is not enough, the registered owner must simply demonstrate before the Registrar, or before the Court, that the trademark in question was used during the relevant period or that any disuse is due to special circumstances ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 16;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[20]", "The Federal Court of Appeal in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (", "Scott Paper", ") recently shed light on what is meant by the phrase \"special circumstances\". According to the Court of Appeal at paragraph 22 of its decision, the general rule is that in the absence of use, a trademark will be expunged. While an exception to this general rule exists where the absence is due to special circumstances, what are considered to be special circumstances must be circumstances that are not found in most cases of absence of use of a trademark. Finally, the special circumstances, which excuse the absence of use of a trademark, must be the circumstances to which the absence of use is due. It is important to highlight that the Federal Court of Appeal states that the inquiry into whether special circumstances exist is an inquiry into the reasons for the non-use and that an intention to resume use cannot be used to support a finding of special circumstances (paragraphs 25 and 35)."], ["[21]", "In", "Scott Paper", ", the Federal Court of Appeal was explaining its earlier decision in,", "Harris Knitting", ", above. In the latter decision, the Court stated that while it is impossible to enumerate what circumstances would constitute \"special circumstances\", in making such a determination, the decision maker should consider the duration of the absence of use and the likelihood of its continuation, along with the extent to which the absence of use is due solely to a deliberate decision on the part of the registered owner or to factors outside his or her control."], ["[22]", "With the foregoing in mind, and with no reason to discredit the evidence submitted by the applicant, I believe that the applicant has demonstrated that the non-use of the USQUAEBACH mark is excused by the existence of special circumstances."], ["[23]", "First and foremost, the period of non-use must be determined in order to examine the cause. It is clear that the applicant did not obtain the rights to the USQUAEBACH mark in Canada until April 5, 2007. The applicant submits that in the case of an assignment of a trademark, the period of non-use, with regard to the present registered owner, should be considered from the date the owner acquired the mark (", "Re Rainbow Jeans Co. Ltd.", ", [1994] T.M.O.B. No. 152). For the purposes of the present application, I do not think it matters whether the Court considers the period of time since the applicant acquired the USQUAEBACH mark or the period since the mark was last used in Canada."], ["[24]", "The last use of the USQUAEBACH mark in Canada is likely attributable to the business carried out by Twelve Stone. At the time the evidence was filed by the applicant, Cobalt had not yet resumed use of the USQUAEBACH mark in Canada. Furthermore, according to the evidence submitted, there was never any business related to the sale of blended Scotch Whiskey bearing the USQUAEBACH mark between Van Caem Belgium and any wholesaler or other licensed entity in Canada. While the evidence on record shows that as late as September 2003 the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) had listed for sale blended Scotch Whiskey products with the USQUAEBACH mark, there is no evidence to support that this stock was received by way of any business transaction with Van Caem Belgium. On the contrary, according to Mr. Halpern, the Vice President of Halpern Imports Limited, who acted as the import agent for Twelve Stone with respect to the various USQUAEBACH blended Scotch Whiskey products imported into the province of Ontario, the last shipment of products containing the USQUAEBACH mark was 75 cases of blended Scotch Whiskey which had been ordered by the LCBO in 2001. Therefore, the stock listed by the LCBO was likely part of the last sale carried out while Twelve Stone was the registered owner of the USQUAEBACH mark, which means that the last use of the mark would have been in or around 2001.", "Special Circumstances"], ["[25]", "As mentioned above, in 2001, Mr Stankiwicz and his wife, who collectively owned approximately 95% of Twelve Stone, passed away, resulting in the suspension of all sales of USQUAEBACH blended Scotch Whiskey. The death of the partners in charge of the business meets the criteria of special circumstances (", "Re I.D. Fashions Ltd.", ", [1998] T.M.O.B. No. 109 at paragraph 12). While this incident alone may not constitute special circumstances that are capable of justifying the absence of use of the USQUAEBACH mark over the last nine years, as is discussed below, the history of the ownership of this mark is plagued by a series of unfortunate events."], ["[26]", "The USQUAEBACH mark was assigned to Van Caem, and subsequently Van Caem Belgium, pursuant to a U.S. Court order in 2003. At the end of 2003, the principal owner of Van Caem died, resulting in the suspension of all business and ultimately a lengthy liquidation process that started in 2004 and, according to the applicant, lasted a number of years. While the affidavit of Mr. Kroon states that efforts had been made to find a producer of Scotch Whiskey in Scotland, the death of the principal owner put an end to any possibility of marketing, producing or distributing USQUAEBACH blended Scotch Whiskey in Canada."], ["[27]", "The duration of the absence of use between the last shipment of USQUAEBACH products to Ontario in 2001 and the date the applicant acquired the USQUAEBACH mark (April 5, 2007) was approximately six years. Given the fact that within these six years two registered owners of the USQUAEBACH mark were forced to discontinue carrying on their businesses as a result of the deaths of their principal owners, I think it can be said that the absence of use within this time period was due to special circumstances. As is required by the decision in", "Scott Paper", ", the evidence demonstrates that the absence of use by these registered owners was directly related to the deaths in question. Furthermore, these incidents constitute circumstances that are not faced in most circumstances of non-use of a trademark and they cannot be said to be the result of a deliberate decision on the part of the registered owner."], ["[28]", "With regard to the period of time since Cobalt acquired the USQUAEBACH mark, Mr. Perry submits that he immediately began taking steps to re-commence the production and distribution of USQUAEBACH blended Scotch Whiskey products in Canada. These steps included, inter alia: finding a Scottish distiller that could match the quality of the USQUAEBACH products sold by previous owners; ensuring that each label associated with the different varieties of USQUAEBACH blended Scotch Whiskey complies with the labelling regulations; negotiating distribution deals in each province Cobalt wished to serve, namely Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; ensuring that Cobalt complies with local liquor regulations in the various jurisdictions it planned on serving (which in Canada would require Cobalt to ensure compliance with each individual province's liquor regulations); and finding a licensed importer in Canada. Given that the production and labelling of Scotch Whiskey must also comply with Scottish law, it is not surprising that this process would likely take a significant amount of time to complete."], ["[29]", "It is clear from the evidence that Mr. Perry was not dealing with the acquisition of an ongoing business with existing supply and distribution networks. As a result of the troubled history of ownership over the USQUAEBACH mark, Mr. Perry was required to rebuild the production and distribution of USQUAEBACH Scotch Whiskey from the ground up."], ["[30]", "The record before the Court establishes that as early as July 2008, Mr. Perry was corresponding with the Société des alcools du Québec (SAQ) via e-mail. In one e-mail dated May 11, 2009, the SAQ agrees to purchase a total of 50 cases of USQUAEBACH blended Scotch Whiskey products. At the time this evidence was submitted to the Court, Mr. Perry stated that these shipments were expected to be delivered in October or November of 2009."], ["[31]", "While it has been made clear in", "Scott Paper", ", above, that the intention to resume use may not be used to support a finding of special circumstances, it is not the intention demonstrated through the applicant's actions which excuse the absence of use in the present case. It is relevant that the immediate resumption of use of the USQUAEBACH mark by Cobalt was impeded by the nature of the liquor industry, and more specifically, the regulatory schemes that must be complied with in each Canadian province. Even more importantly, however, is the fact that due to the two deaths between 2001 and 2007, USQUAEBACH blended Scotch Whiskey had not been in production for six years, requiring the applicant to start from beginning. The Court finds that in light of the foregoing, there is a basis to conclude that the absence of use of the USQUAEBACH mark since April 2007 was also due to special circumstances that are not normally faced in circumstances of non use and are not due to the deliberate decision of the registered owner."], ["[32]", "Furthermore, the evidence demonstrates that Cobalt intends to resume use of the USQUAEBACH mark and while this does not excuse the absence of use, it is a good indication that the period of non-use is likely close to an end."], ["[33]", "Given that the purpose of section 45 of the", "Act", "is to provide a means to have expunged from the register trademarks which have not been used and for which there is no reasonable prospect that they will be used (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 307 (T.D.) at paragraph 50), the Court finds that the USQUAEBACH mark should not be expunged from the register."], ["[34]", "In light of the foregoing, the appeal will be allowed, the decision of the Registrar must be set aside, and the USQUAEBACH mark under registration number TMA219908 must be reinstated."], ["[35]", "While the applicant has not asked for its costs, it has requested that the Court specify that such an order is not a waiver by and is without prejudice to the parties' rights to pursue any claims they may have against each other, including the legal costs relating to this proceeding.

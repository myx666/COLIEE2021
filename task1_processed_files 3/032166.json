The outcome of the proceedings before the IAD depended entirely upon the relative credibility of Mr. Dhaliwal and his ex-wife, Ms. Mahli.

While there is no evidence before me that Mr. Dhaliwal had read it, the IAD's own \"Information Guide\" clearly contemplates that self-represented appellants may ask Board members to ask them the questions that the Member thinks are needed to decide the appeal: see", "Information Guide - General Procedures for all Appeals to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD)", ", at section 3(1)."], ["[10]", "The presiding member in this case refused to question Mr. Dhaliwal, advising him that \"That is not the way it works\": transcript p. 4. Rather, the member repeatedly asked Mr. Dhaliwal to explain who would question him in chief if he were to take the stand. When Mr. Dhaliwal could not provide a satisfactory answer to this question, the hearing moved on to other matters, and Mr. Dhaliwal was never given an opportunity to testify as to his version of events."], ["[11]", "The Board then stated in its decision that Mr. Dhaliwal \"was not examined as he had chosen to act as his own counsel\"."], ["[12]", "At no time did the member ever explain to Mr. Dhaliwal that he could simply take the witness stand, be sworn in and tell his side of the story. Mr. Dhaliwal would, of course, then be subject to cross-examination by the Minister's counsel."], ["[13]", "There is no doubt that self-represented litigants can present challenges for adjudicators, who must be careful not to enter into the fray, or to try to act as counsel for the self-represented individual.

Indeed, it appears that the presiding member did not himself understand the procedural options available when an individual appearing without counsel wished to give evidence on his own behalf."], ["[16]", "Moreover, it is evident from a review of the transcript that after this initial error at the outset of the hearing, the hearing went downhill from there. The presiding member repeatedly interfered with Mr. Dhaliwal's cross-examination of Ms. Mahli. While some of these interventions were undoubtedly justified, on other occasions Mr. Dhaliwal was prevented from asking what were clearly relevant questions."], ["[17]", "The member also denied Mr. Dhaliwal any opportunity to respond to Ms. Mahli's testimony.

It is evident from the transcript that he continuously attempted to get his evidence before the Board, and that he was prevented from doing so by the Board. He was ultimately forced to accept the directions and rulings of the presiding member, and to proceed accordingly. The principle of waiver is not engaged in these circumstances."], ["[24]", "Finally, I do not accept the Minister's submission that notwithstanding the breaches of procedural fairness in this case, there would be no purpose to remitting the matter to the IAD, as the outcome of any re-hearing would be a foregone conclusion."], ["[25]", "As a general rule, a breach of procedural fairness will void the hearing and the resulting decision: see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .

This is not such a case."], ["[27]", "As was noted earlier, this is a classic \"he said/she said\" case. The stories told by Ms. Mahli and Mr. Dhaliwal differ in many fundamental respects. The Immigration Division preferred Ms. Mahli's version of events to that of Mr. Dhaliwal. The IAD will ultimately have to choose between these competing stories, but it must do so only after both sides have had a full and fair opportunity to present whatever relevant evidence they deem appropriate. I cannot say at this point that the outcome of the proceeding is pre-ordained.", "Costs"], ["[28]", "Counsel for Mr. Dhaliwal submits that the breaches of procedural fairness in this case were so egregious that an order of costs should be made in his favour."], ["[29]", "Costs are not ordinarily awarded in immigration proceedings in this Court.

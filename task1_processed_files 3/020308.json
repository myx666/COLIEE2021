Similar contracts were entered for the subsequent two school years.

The complainant wrote a letter to the Director of Education for the Band, Mr. Patrick Bruyere, outlining her concerns with respect to the evaluation. This letter was reviewed by the School Board in consultation with Ms. Courchene.

If these annual contracts, and in particular the last one, were found to be valid, then the employer's decision not to offer the complainant a position for the 1993-1994 school year was made in conformity with the terms of the contract and does not constitute a dismissal. Hence, the adjudicator would have been without jurisdiction to hear the complaint.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The adjudicator held that by requiring the complainant to sign an annual contract in 1983 despite having offered her a \"permanent\" teaching contract in 1981, the applicant arbitrarily altered the employment relationship \"under the guise of termination of a contract and replacement\". The adjudicator found that a refusal to sign the annual contracts would have invited termination, jeopardized the complainant's career and caused hardship to herself and her family. He added that the inequality of bargaining power in favour of the employer made the employer's unilateral alteration of the employment relationship \"unconscionable\". Relying on the established body of case law relating to unilaterally imposed policy changes, the Adjudicator went on to conclude that (Adjudicator's Decision, at p. 13):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"In my view, whether an employment policy is arbitrarily imposed or an employment relationship is arbitrarily altered under the guise of termination of a contract and replacement, the principles applied should be no different.

Relying on established jurisprudence in this area, the Court of Appeal held it did not on the basis that the employee had not agreed to the change in policy. Specifically, it held that the inequality of the bargaining position of the employer and the employee placed a heavy onus on the employer to establish that the plaintiff had agreed to the policy, and that this onus had not been met.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeal reviewed the case law regarding the imposition of employment policies on employees.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the defendant employer under a contract which fixed his remuneration by reference to a stipulated rate of commission on net sales. The contract, which provided for an indefinite employment terminable on two weeks' notice, also contained a restrictive covenant (applicable for one year following termination) in respect of the area of employment. The employer subsequently began to withhold 10% of commissions earned by the plaintiff and other salesmen as a reserve for bad debts. The plaintiff complained periodically about these deductions, but remained in the defendant's employ for a year after they began. The plaintiff then sued to recover the withheld commissions. The Ontario Court of Appeal, per Mackay, J.A., at pp. 131-132 held that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"... it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that an employee accepts an attempted variation simply by the fact alone of continuing in his employment.", "Where an employer attempts to vary the contractual terms, the position of the employee is this: He may accept the variation expressly or impliedly in which case there is a new contract.", "He may refuse to accept it and if the employer persists in the attempted variation the employee may treat this persistence as a breach of contract and sue the employer for damages, or while refusing to accept it he may continue in his employment and if the employer permits him to discharge his obligations and the employee makes it plain that he is not accepting the variation, then the employee is entitled to insist on the original terms.\" (Emphasis mine)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "also reviewed the decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In", "Pronovost", ", the plaintiff employee was dismissed summarily and given only two weeks' severance pay. The employer relied on a provision in its company personnel manual, known to the plaintiff, which stated that it was not company policy to pay severance pay. The employer's position was that once the employee had become aware of the policy, he must be taken to have agreed to it when he continued in the same employment despite the change. In dismissing the employer's arguments and deciding that the plaintiff was entitled to reasonable notice or salary in lieu of notice, the court stated, at p. 283:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"I just cannot accept that unrealistic position. To object to the policy would be to invite termination. I repeat what I said in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.), Vancouver No. C820989, 18th November 1982 (not yet reported):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "'It is the position of counsel for the defendants that the plaintiff is bound by the policy outlined in the handbook. I cannot agree with that proposition and that would be so even if the plaintiff had read and understood the pertinent section of the handbook when received in 1978-79.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "In the absence of a contractual arrangement", ", the plaintiff was entitled at common law to reasonable notice or salary in lieu of notice.

[hereinafter", "Starcevich", ", cited to C.C.E.L.]. The defendant employer argued that because the employee had been aware of the company policy regarding severance, and had even applied it to other employees, the policy had become a term of employment. The court dismissed this argument and held at p. 51:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"If the defendant is correct in saying that the 1987 severance policy became a term of the plaintiff's employment when it was promulgated, then, in my view, the defendant is saying that it had the right to unilaterally impose a new term of employment on the plaintiff long after the initial hiring. I know of no theory of contract law which suggests that one party can unilaterally impose a contractual term on the other", "unless the other agrees to accept that term as a term of his or her contract", ".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"In this case the defendant says that the plaintiff accepted the policy as a term of his employment. In support of that statement, the defendant points to the fact that the plaintiff was aware of the policy, and that he, in fact, applied the policy to others during the course of his employment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"In my view, neither of those facts establishes, on balance, that the plaintiff accepted that policy as a term of his own contract of employment. The plaintiff may well have had to deal with the dismissal of employees as part of his job description, and if there was a policy in effect, no doubt he was required to apply that policy. It does not follow that by applying the policy he must be taken to have accepted that he was legally bound by the policy in the event of his own dismissal.", "There would have to be clear and unequivocal evidence to establish that the plaintiff had agreed to the policy forming part of his own contract of employment", ". Such clear and unequivocal evidence does not exist in the material before me.\" (Emphasis mine)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "The rule established by these decisions is therefore quite clear. An employment policy introduced by an employer does not become a term of the employment contract unless and until it has been clearly agreed to by the employee. Knowledge of the policy by an employee while he or she continues in the same employment without asserting any objection will not necessarily be construed as acquiescence particularly where a denunciation of the policy could invite termination. However, as is explicitly stated in each of the cases referred to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ", if there is clear and unequivocal acceptance of the policy as a term of employment, the policy is binding on the employee.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "How is this principle to be applied to the case at bar? In 1983, the applicant informed its employees that it would be requiring them to sign annual contracts with the school board, notwithstanding the fact that they had originally been engaged under contracts of an indeterminate duration. Clearly, this action on the part of the employer was an attempt to vary the contractual terms of employment. What then were the options open to the respondent? As noted by the Ontario Court of Appeal in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it was open to her to accept the variation in which case a new annual contract came into existence. It was also open to the respondent to refuse to accept the variation. If the employer persisted and refused to continue her employment for failure to abide by the unilaterally imposed term as the adjudicator envisaged, she could then have sought the appropriate remedy for unjust dismissal. This remedy would have been available whether the respondent had been terminated outright, or under the guise of a refusal to continue her employment for the subsequent school year. See", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "However, by signing the first annual contract and each one thereafter over a 10-year period, the respondent consented, in the clearest way possible, to the variation to the contract proposed by her employer. Assuming that this consent was validly given, a new employment contract, with a one-year duration, came into existence and replaced the preceding one. It is therefore apparent that this is not a case of an employee confronted by a unilaterally imposed policy change which has not been expressly accepted as  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Gorman", "Stacevich", "or", "Pronovost", ". The annual contracts signed by the respondent year after year evidence her acceptance in the clearest way known to law and therefore bind her to the fullest extent. The Adjudicator therefore erred in failing to take note of this acceptance and in holding that the matter could be decided by reference to the principle developed in the aforementioned cases.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "If, on the other hand, the Adjudicator's decision can be read as holding that the respondent should nevertheless be relieved from her contract on the sole ground that her bargaining position was inferior to that of the employer, then it is entirely without legal foundation. (There was no suggestion on the part of the complainant that she should be relieved of her contract on any other ground, i.e., undue influence, duress, misrepresentation, fraud or non est factum, nor did the adjudicator make any finding in this regard.) Bargaining positions are rarely if ever equal in any given contractual relationship. In the context of employment contracts, the employer usually has the stronger bargaining power. That, as such, has never been held to be a ground for allowing an employee to repudiate the terms of a contract. The Adjudicator was obviously concerned by the fact that, in his view, a refusal by the respondent to accept the contractual modification in 1983 might have led to her termination. But even if that be so, she was entitled to reasonable notice and no one could have taken that right away from her if indeed she had decided to exercise it. Instead of exercising that right, she opted to accept the contractual modification. That is the choice that she made.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "I would add that in assessing whether there was anything \"unconscionable\" about the circumstances in which the respondent made that choice, as the adjudicator suggests there was, it must be remembered that there is no legal entitlement to permanent employment. An employer may terminate employment of an indeterminate duration at any time, just as an employee may quit such employment at any time, provided that in either case reasonable notice be given. In the same vein, an employer may attempt to change the fundamental terms of an employment contract, in which case an employee may accept or refuse to adhere to such changes. If the employee does refuse, the employer cannot compel acceptance. However, the employer retains the right to terminate the employment provided that reasonable notice is given. That, it seems, is the context in which the respondent found herself in 1983. Rather than insisting on her contractual rights, she chose to adhere to the modified terms of employment. That choice was made freely and it cannot be said that there was anything \"unconscionable\" about the circumstances in which it was made. (Recognizing that any judgment as to what is and what is not \"unconscionable\" is most subjective, what I am saying is that whatever judgment is placed on the situation, no legal remedy can flow from it.)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "Having decided that the annual contracts were binding on the complainant, it follows that the applicant's decision not to renew the last contract for the 1993-1994 school year was made in conformity with its terms and does not result in a dismissal within the meaning of s. 240(1) of the", "Canada Labour Code", ".

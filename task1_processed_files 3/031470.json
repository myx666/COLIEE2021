From the Blue Treasure Batch Records, we can track the runs that Blue Treasure claims it used for this particular strain. Merck counsel prepared Exhibit 156 from the Batch Records.

However, as the evidence shows, the strains of both Aspergillus terreus and Coniothyrium fuckelii were present in the Davies Lab at the relevant time. Dr. Gilbert also confirmed that the risk of contamination from the control DNA from Aspergillus terreus or Coniothyrium fuckelii was equivalent, even though the DNA concentration would differ. Yet, Dr. Davies found Aspergillus terreus DNA in 13 experiments but never documented a single instance of Coniothyrium fuckelii. How could it be that amplified Aspergillus terreus DNA would cause contamination but not the Coniothyrium fuckelii DNA? Dr. Gilbert repeatedly refused to accept the possibility that zero findings of Coniothyrium fuckelii DNA should reassure the experimenter that contamination by Aspergillus terreus was not probable. I find his denials to be unhelpful and, frankly, illogical. Thus, Merck submits, Dr. Taylor's theory does not withstand examination. I agree. Zero findings of Coniothyrium fuckelii demonstrates the weakness in the theory that contamination would, more likely than not, occur from Aspergillus terreus DNA that was amplified by PCR in the Davies Lab."], ["[435]", "Another theory of contamination presented by Dr. Taylor was the possibility of airborne spores.

Dr. Davies' laboratory records from 2007 confirm that DNA was amplified from the lovastatin samples using coniothyrium fuckelii specific primers, thus indicating the presence of coniothyrium fuckelii DNA in the sample.

Dr. Poinar agreed that, based on the data, one could not conclude that the band observed by Dr. Taylor was a band of Coniothyrium fuckelii DNA.

I think that Apotex confuses \"disclosure to one member of the public\" as stated in", "Baker  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 42, with \"one disclosure\". If the prior art invariably or predictably discloses the compound, there may well be anticipation. However, where the existence of the compound alleged to be anticipatory cannot be reasonably or consistently predicted from a large universe of possibilities, I cannot see how this could possibly meet the test for disclosure. Anticipation must be more than an accidental presence of a compound."], ["[603]", "Not only does Apotex's argument appear illogical to me, it is not supported by the jurisprudence. In", "Abbott Clarithromycin (FCA)", ", above, at paragraph 22, the Court of Appeal considered the argument of Abbott that a skilled person must have certain knowledge regarding the prior art.", "\"Abbott argues that a person skilled in the art who heated clarithromycin Form I by the known technique would not and could not know that clarithromycin Form II had been created, unless they also knew that the heating process had to be stopped before the substance reached its melting point at 225ºC.

There were well established analytical techniques that would have disclosed its presence if anyone had cared to look at the appropriate moment.\" (Emphasis added.)"], ["[604]", "In the case before me, I have no such evidence that lovastatin", "would have been present", "in Red Yeast Rice. Indeed the evidence, as disclosed in the literature cited (for example, Negishi and Heber), is that lovastatin was present only in a very few samples."], ["[605]", "Apotex also argues that the fact that no one, including the skilled person, ever recognized that Red Yeast Rice contained lovastatin is not relevant. Apotex submits that the Federal Court of Appeal, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> refers to the principle, outlined by Lord Hoffmann in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (", "Synthon BV", "), that a patent is disclosed even though the author or maker of the prior art was not aware that he was doing so.

However, an examination of the entire passage clarifies the context in which those remarks were made. As stated by Lord Hoffmann  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  BV", ", above, at paragraphs 22-23:", "\"... the matter relied upon as prior art must disclose subject matter which, if performed, would necessarily result in an infringement of the patent ... . But patent infringement does not require that one should be aware that one is infringing: 'whether or not a person is working [an] ... invention is an objective fact independent of what he knows or thinks about what he is doing':", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . It follows that, whether or not it would be apparent to anyone at the time, whenever subject-matter described in the prior disclosure is capable of being performed and is such that, if performed, it must result in the patent being infringed, the disclosure condition is satisfied. The flag has been planted, even though the author or maker of the prior art was not aware that he was doing so.", "\"Thus,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Dow", ", the ingestion of terfenadine by hay-fever sufferers, which was the subject of prior disclosure, necessarily entailed the making of the patented acid metabolite in their livers. It was therefore an anticipation of the acid metabolite, even though no one was aware that it was being made or even that it existed. But the infringement must be not merely a possible or even likely consequence of performing the invention disclosed by the prior disclosure. It must be necessarily entailed. If there is more than one possible consequence, one cannot say that performing the disclosed invention will infringe. The flag has not been planted on the patented invention, although a person performing the invention disclosed by the prior art may carry it there by accident or (if he is aware of the patented invention) by design. Indeed, it may be obvious to do so. But the prior disclosure must be construed as it would have been understood by the skilled person at the date of the disclosure and not in the light of the subsequent patent. As the Technical Board of Appeal said in", "T/396/89 UNION CARBIDE/high tear strength polymers", ", [1992] EPOR 312 at para. 4.4:", "'It may be easy, given a knowledge of a later invention, to select from the general teachings of a prior art document certain conditions, and apply them to an example in that document, so as to produce an end result having all the features of the later claim. However, success in so doing does not prove that the result was", "inevitable", ". All that it demonstrates is that, given knowledge of the later invention, the earlier teaching is capable of being adapted to give the same result. Such an adaptation cannot be used to attack the novelty of a later patent.'\""], ["[607]", "An understanding of this passage demonstrates that Apotex has selectively read the comments of Lord Hoffmann, omitting a key consideration. I agree with Apotex that an awareness that the prior art discloses the anticipatory invention is not a requirement of disclosure. Justice Hughes made that point  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Clarithromycin", "(FC)", ", above, at paragraph 75. However, while supporting the argument of Apotex, the passage from", "Synthon BV", ", above, makes it very clear that the disclosure requirement is only met where infringement", "must", "occur when the prior art is practised.

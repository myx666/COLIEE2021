Indeed, the applicant and his wife supposedly underwent the religious ceremony in 2004 in order to save their families from the shame of an illegitimate child. Furthermore, when the applicant's wife applied for permanent residence in 2006, she indicated that she and the applicant had married in 2004, and had been living together since 2000.

It is not normally deadly, but it is incurable and can cause great discomfort and/or embarrassment. It typically involves repeated recurrences of scaly and inflamed skin. The severity of an occurrence of psoriasis may vary greatly. It may be mild, moderate or severe. Severity is often estimated by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) which takes into account the size of the affected area, redness, thickness and scaling."], ["[9]", "Just as occurrences of psoriasis are intermittent, treatment is normally likewise intermittent, being directed to reducing the symptoms. During the 1990s, the most popular treatments were corticosteroids (of which betamethasone dipropionate is one) and vitamin D analogues, more specifically calcipotriol (which is also known as calcipotriene). Leo held a patent on calcipotriol in a number of countries which expired around 2009."], ["[10]", "Corticosteroids and calcipotriol could be applied individually. Each had advantages and disadvantages. In the early 1990s, it was found that there were advantages to a treatment regimen that involved both compounds. A sequential therapy, whereby each of the corticosteroid and the calcipotriol was applied at different times of the day or the week, became a well-known treatment. The sequential therapy resulted in fewer side effects, less irritation and more rapid onset of healing."], ["[11]", "However, there were problems of patient compliance with the sequential therapy, e.g. due to patients erring as to which compound should be applied at a particular time, or simply not having the patience to apply the treatment twice every day. A combined formulation of calcipotriol and a corticosteroid was sought."], ["[12]", "Unfortunately, it was not a simple matter to develop a combined formulation because the two products are pH incompatible. That is, their respective optimum stabilities are at significantly different pH values. Calcipotriol requires a pH value above 8 (an alkaline environment) for maximum stability, while corticosteroids require pH values in the 4-6 range (an acidic environment) for maximum stability. This pH incompatibility would make a combined formulation of a corticosteroid and calcipotriol alone unstable in that one or both of the compounds would be liable to degrade prior to application."], ["[13]", "The parties disagree as to the extent to which dermatologists and/or patients, prior to the development of the patented formulation, mixed calcipotriol and corticosteroids despite their incompatibility. Teva alleges that some dermatologists routinely instructed patients to apply the two compounds simultaneously on the skin. Leo does not accept that this method of treatment was common. The expert evidence likewise differs on this point. In any case, it is common ground that there was a motivation to create a combined formulation for treatment of psoriasis that would be stable for a reasonable period of time so that patients would not have to deal with two separate compounds and mix the compounds themselves.", "II.", "The 565 Patent"], ["[14]", "The 565 Patent has a filing date of January 27, 2000, and is based on a priority application that was filed in Denmark on April 23, 1999.

There are two points worthy of note in relation to this factor. Firstly, the experimentation to be carried out to confirm whether a particular combination of compounds is stable in the current context is quite straightforward and routine. Essentially, one need only create the necessary testing conditions and then wait. The second point is that, if we accept a scenario in which the skilled person conducting a diligent search would find the Turi prior art, we must also accept that the skilled person would also find many hundreds (possibly, thousands) of other prior art references, all pointing to different possible solutions."], ["[142]", "Even if stability testing is relatively simple, the extent of effort required to achieve the invention will be very high unless the number of combinations can be reduced. Accordingly, the main challenge in conceiving the invention would be in narrowing the scope of possible compositions for testing to a practical number.", "(c)", "More or Less Self-Evident that What is Being Tried Ought to Work"], ["[143]", "Teva's argument on this point is that, having found the Turi prior art, the skilled person would have been led to the claimed combination and would have concluded that it was more or less self-evident that this combination ought to work. In other words, it was plain that there was a fair expectation of success."], ["[144]", "Teva points out that Turi discloses an ointment comprising a corticosteroid (diflorasone diacetate) with POP-15.

Leo acknowledges that using a non-aqueous base would indeed reduce the amount of water, and hence the extent of the problem of pH compatibility, but Leo asserts that small amounts of water exist in the ingredients of the composition such that the problem could not be eliminated entirely. This may be true, but there is no evidence as to whether the amount of water that might remain with a non-aqueous base comprising a vitamin D analogue and a corticosteroid would be sufficient to affect the stability of either. Without more, I am not prepared to accept that Leo's argument in this respect \"holds water\"."], ["[146]", "However, Teva's argument concerning the obviousness of using a non-aqueous base to resolve the pH incompatibility problem is not enough to establish that the invention of the 565 Patent was obvious. To establish obviousness, it would be necessary to show that this was all that was needed to achieve a stable composition when combining calcipotriol with a corticosteroid,", "e.g.", "a simple combination of calcipotriol and a corticosteroid (and without POP-15) in a non-aqueous base would be stable. The evidence does not support this. The unsuccessful example described in the 565 Patent, in which calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate were combined in a non-aqueous ointment using propylene glycol as the solvent and lanolin as an emulsifier suggests otherwise. As indicated above, it was not clear why that composition was unstable, while the composition using POP-15 was stable."], ["[147]", "Teva responds to this point by noting that, as of the claim date, it was not publicly known that the composition with propylene glycol as the solvent would not work, and therefore there was no reason for the skilled person not to have a fair expectation of success even with a composition including propylene glycol."], ["[148]", "For its part, Leo replies that propylene glycol was a common solvent in pharmaceuticals, whereas POP-15 was not part of the common general knowledge of the skilled person. Moreover, propylene glycol has a lower acid and water content than POP-15. Therefore, the skilled person would have tried propylene glycol (as acknowledged by Dr. Cooper during his cross-examination), and would have done so before trying POP-15. The unsuccessful result of that attempt, together with the commonly-known information about propylene glycol's more promising acid and water content properties, would have removed any fair expectation of success that the skilled person might otherwise have had in trying POP-15. I agree with Leo's position."], ["[149]", "Leo argues that much of the prior art taught away from combining a vitamin D analogue and a corticosteroid in the same composition.

However, nothing in the prior art would have led the skilled person to believe that a combined composition including POP-15 would", "not", "resolve the stability problem.

In this sense, the prior art did not teach away from the solution taught in the 565 Patent."], ["[150]", "As indicated earlier, for the purposes of this analysis, I assume without deciding that a diligent search by a skilled person would have revealed the Turi prior art. Even if the skilled person had been aware of Turi, it is my view that s/he would not have been led to the solution taught in the 565 Patent. There would have been many other prior art references to consider; so many in fact that it would seem impractical to expect the skilled person to have tested them all. Accordingly, for the skilled person to have focused on Turi over other possibilities there would have to have been something promising in it. I do not see such promise. The value of POP-15 would not have been apparent until after the invention had been found."], ["[151]", "Moreover, even if the skilled person", "had", "been led to combine a vitamin D analogue, a corticosteroid and POP-15, it would have been without a fair expectation of success.

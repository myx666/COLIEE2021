Does this mean that the residences permit lapses in law", "at the time", "that the holder leaves Germany if there is no intent to return as in the case we describe?\" (emphasis in original). In a response handwritten on the original letter, Ms. Siegel stated: \"When you leave with the intention", "not", "to return, yes\" (emphasis in original). Given the informality of the response, I do not find this evidence compelling, nor do I find it to be sufficient to establish the content of section 44(1)2 of the", "Aliens Act", ". I also note that Ms. Siegel's comment was not cited by the Board in its decision."], ["[54]", "In summary, I find that there was insufficient evidence to reasonably allow the Board to find that competent authorities in Germany would have considered the Respondent to no longer have the rights and obligations afforded to German nationals as of September 15, 1999. As a result, I am of the view that the Board's conclusion is unreasonable."], ["[55]", "The Board in its reasons went on to consider whether the Respondent could regain status in Germany after finding that she had indeed lost status at the time of her admission to Canada. In my view such an analysis is not relevant to the determinative issue. As I stated above, at the time of her arrival in Canada, the Respondent was in possession of a permanent residency permit from Germany which was valid until December 31, 2000. In other words, at the operative date for determining exclusion the Respondent had a valid permit which gave her residency in Germany, including the right to return.", "8.", "Conclusion"], ["[56]", "I find that the Board committed a reviewable error in determining that the Respondent was not subject to Article 1E of the", "Refugee Convention", ". I would set aside the decision of the Board. In my opinion, the only conclusion that can be reached in the circumstances of this case is that at the time of her admission to Canada, competent authorities in Germany would have considered the Respondent to have the rights and obligations afforded to a German national, including the right to return to Germany. In my view, the result is inevitable. Pursuant to section 98 of the", "IRPA", ", the Respondent is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection."], ["[57]", "In the circumstances of this case, I would not remit the matter back to the Board for re-determination by a differently constituted panel. I find that the matter of the Respondent's refugee claim against Iran is settled because she is not eligible for refugee protection in Canada on the basis of her residency status in Germany at the time of her admission to Canada. Further, I find that the Respondent's refugee claim against Germany is no longer an issue to be determined by the Board. The First Panel did not conclude that the Respondent had established a well-founded fear of persecution against Germany. Although not dismissing the Respondent's claim against Germany, in the end, the First Panel only found that the Respondent's refugee claim against Iran was made out. At her second refugee hearing, the Respondent essentially abandoned her claim for refugee protection against Germany by not pursuing the matter before the Board during oral testimony and in submissions by counsel. As a result, I find that there would be no purpose in sending the Respondent's refugee claim back to the Board, as her refugee claim has been fully canvassed by the Board and the Court, and the outcome has been determined: see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 172 N.R. 308 (F.C.A.)."], ["[58]", "That said, I am cognizant that given the passage of time it is unlikely that the Respondent would now have permanent residency status in Germany. Without deciding the matter, the evidence before the Board indicates that this is likely the case. On the merits of her claim, the Respondent had been found to be a Convention refugee and, but for her exclusion under Article 1E, she would by definition be a protected person. Since she likely has no status in Germany, her removal would be to Iran. In the circumstances, this may be an appropriate case for the Minister to exercise discretion under section 25 of the", "IRPA", ". In any event, should the Respondent make an application for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA), the risk assessment officer should bear in mind the Board's earlier finding that the Respondent established a well-founded fear of persecution against Iran, and that that finding was not contested by the Minister. I make this observation on the understanding that the Respondent at the moment likely has no status in Germany."], ["[59]", "The parties will have an opportunity to make submissions concerning certification of a question or questions of general importance.

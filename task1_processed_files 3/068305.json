{"id_": "068305", "body_str": [["[1]", "Kelen, J.", ": This is an application for judicial review of a decision of Mr. Alain Bérubé, Operational Manager, Québec Operational Centre, Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate, Health Canada dated September 16, 2005, which classified the applicant's generic drug vancomycin hydrochloride, marketed as \"Vancopak\", as a new drug in dosage form, and not an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for compounding. This case raises the issue of whether vancomycin hydrochloride, a drug in powder form for reconstitution with a liquid solvent, is a \"drug in dosage form\" under the", "Food and Drug Regulations", ", C.R.C., c. 870 (", "Regulations", "), which requires a Drug Identification Number (DIN) or is an API for compounding by a pharmacist so that it does not require a DIN.", "Facts"], ["[2]", "The applicant, CPTI, established eight years ago and based in the Province of Québec, refers to itself as a \"consulting and distribution company\".

A member of that purchasing group informed Health Canada that it had been contacted by CPTI to purchase this product without a Drug Identification Number."], ["[5]", "On January 17, 2005, CPTI in a letter to the purchasing group, stated that its vancomycin hydrochloride, which was then sold under the trade name Vancomysol, is presented in an amber bottle, in portions of 5 grams, to which a hospital pharmacist can add 100 ml of liquid to obtain a concentration of 50 mg/ml.

Accordingly, this factor is neutral."], ["[13]", "For the second factor, Health Canada has a greater expertise relative to the Court in relation to classification, manufacture and safe sale of drugs. Determining whether a product should be classified and regulated as a \"drug in dosage form\" requires the exercise of judgment derived from special expertise in respect of basic and applied medical science. The line that divides drugs that are in \"dosage form\" from those that require further \"manufacturing\" is, in accordance with Parliament's intent, one that is best demarcated by regulators with expertise in drug regulation. As a result, deference is owed to the Health Canada's determination of factual questions."], ["[14]", "For questions of statutory interpretation or defining the scope of jurisdiction under the", "Act", ", the Court has greater expertise than Health Canada, and less deference is owed."], ["[15]", "The third factor is the purpose of the legislation; in this case, the applicable legislation is the", "Food and Drugs Act", "and", "Food and Drug Regulations", ". The purpose of the", "Act", "is, inter alia, to regulate the manufacture, distribution, use and sale of drugs to protect the health and safety of the Canadian public. The overriding purpose of \"Part C DRUGS\" of the", "Regulations", "is to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs. Health Canada's product classification decisions are administrative and polycentric in nature, given that they protect the public's safety as gatekeeper to the pharmaceutical market. While classification decisions have some precedential value to Canada's pharmaceutical industry, in my view this factor is ancillary to the main purpose which is to protect the public interest. Accordingly, this factor favours great deference."], ["[16]", "The fourth factor is the nature of Health Canada's product classification decision at issue. In order to exempt itself from the labelling requirements of drugs under the", "Act", "and", "Regulations", ", a manufacturer or seller must establish that its product is not \"a drug in dosage form\" and is an API for compounding. Health Canada's classification decision, therefore, turns on these findings."], ["[17]", "The second issue, whether CPTI's Vancopak is a \"drug in dosage form\" which requires a Drug Identification Number on its label pursuant to section c.01.005(1) of Part C Drugs,", "Food and Drugs Regulations", ", or whether Vancopak is a drug to be compounded by a pharmacist pursuant to a prescription is a question of mixed law and fact, mostly fact. Accordingly, great deference is owed to Health Canada's determination of these factual questions. For this reason, the Court will review these questions on both a patently unreasonable and reasonableness standard of review. The Court is not satisfied that these questions of fact or mixed fact and law, go to the jurisdiction of Health Canada under the", "Act", ", and for this reason will not be reviewed on a standard of correctness."], ["[18]", "For questions of procedural fairness, it is established that the reviewing Judge does not need to engage in a standard of review inquiry.

On December 7, 2002, Health Canada published a Notice of Intent to advise the public that it intended to develop a regulatory framework for APIs. Health Canada adopted a guidance document for the industry on October 3, 2002 entitled \"Good Manufacturing Practice Guidelines for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\". However, this document has no legal effect until Parliament enacts regulations."], ["[28]", "This case highlights the urgent need for Canada to regulate with respect to APIs. The vancomycin hydrochloride sold by the applicant as Vancopak is imported in bulk from China in 5 kg factory sealed containers. In Canada it is repackaged in 5 g portions in bottles, and sold by the applicant under the trade name Vancopak. If the ultimate decision of Health Canada is that Vancopak is not subject to Regulation because it is an active pharmaceutical ingredient, and not \"a drug in dosage form\", then the purity and safety of this powerful antibiotic may not be subject to the regulatory oversight of most drugs in Canada. This could affect the health and safety of Canadians. Accordingly, both parties and the Court concurs, there is an urgent need for Parliament to regulate active pharmaceutical ingredients not being marketed as \"drugs in dosage form\". As both parties said, this is a \"crack\" in the drug regulations which needs to be \"filled\".", "Alleged discrimination"], ["[29]", "The applicant submits that Health Canada is discriminating against it because other companies in Canada are selling vancomycin hydrocholoride to pharmacists without requiring a DIN. The facts presented to the Court show that some vancomycin hydrocholoride powders are sold in Canada with DINs, and some are not. In this case there has been an inquiry or complaint against the applicant, and it is for this reason that Health Canada investigated the applicant, and made the decision under review. The respondent suggested that a similar decision may be made with respect to similar products at a future date. The fact that Health Canada has investigated the inquiry or complaint against the applicant does not mean that the applicant is being discriminated against. The Court agrees. Accordingly, the Court does not consider that Health Canada has discriminated against the applicant.", "Costs"], ["[30]", "The applicant is entitled to rely on the law in bringing its product to market. In this case, the applicant was not given a fair opportunity to know the case against it and to properly respond before the decision was made. For this reason, the applicant is entitled to its legal costs. Health Canada has acted in a reasonably expeditious fashion in dealing with this classification issue. The considerations by Health Canada officials were important ones of public safety and show no evidence of bad faith or arbitrariness.

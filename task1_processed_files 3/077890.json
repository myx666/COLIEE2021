Lord Diplock's description of purposive construction was as follows, at pp. 242-43:", "'My Lords, a patent specification is a unilateral statement by the patentee, in words of his own choosing, addressed to those likely to have a practical interest in the subject matter of his invention (i.e. \"skilled in the art\"), by which he informs them what he claims to be the essential features of the new product or process for which the letters patent grant him a monopoly. It is those novel features only that he claims to be essential that constitute the so-called \"pith and marrow\" of the claim. A patent specification should be given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by their training to indulge. The question in each case is: whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand that strict compliance with a particular descriptive word or phrase appearing in a claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention so that any variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed, even though it could have no material effect upon the way the invention worked.'

I understand that GSK markets controlled-release tablets of paroxetine hydrochloride in association with the trademark PAXIL CR. As such, it is clear that the medicine paroxetine hydrochloride is an active substance suitable for the formulation in a controlled-release tablet such as that claimed in the claims of the '479 Patent.", "\"22. As a result, it is clear that Claims 1-7 of the '393 Patent include within their scope controlled-release tablets of the medicine paroxetine hydrochloride. Indeed, a second entry manufacturer wishing to market controlled-release tablets of paroxetine hydrochloride could look to the claims of the '393 Patent to develop its own formulation or preparation for marketing such tablets.\""], ["[11]", "The 479 patent makes claims for a system of controlled released active substances.

Consequently, he upheld the Minister's decision not to list the patent."], ["[17]", "While these cases clearly establish that patents for the application of a medicine cannot be registered under section 4(2)(b) they are not helpful in determining whether the patents here in issue contain a \"claim for the medicine itself\" or a \"claim for the use of the medicine\". There is, however, a line of cases where patents have been held to qualify for registration under s. 4(2)(b)."], ["[18]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 58 (T.D.), involved four patents involving the medicine flunisolide; namely claims for Form A flunisolide, for the crystalline form of flunisolide, for pharmaceutical formulations containing Form A flunisolide and claims for a process for the preparation of Form A flunisolide itself."], ["[19]", "Similarly, it was raised as a side issue in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 271 (T.D.), that the patent in issue No 2178637 did not comply with section 4(2) of the", "PMNOC Regulations", ".

The patent in issue made claims to a formulation of ceftazidime (held to be a medicine) and amorphous lactose used to defeat the toxicity inherent in ceftazidime. Thus, again, the particular medicine was referred to in the patent in issue."], ["[21]", "By contrast, both the 393 patent and the 479 patent refer to \"active substances\". There is no mention of paroxetine hydrochloride, the medicine in question. The line of case referred to above makes it clear that patents which can be registered (i.e. that qualify under s. 4 (2)(b)) must have a claim involving the medicine in question in the patent. One skilled in the art of patent interpretation can properly find (as Dr. McGinity did) that active substances, as referrred to in the 393 patent and the 479 patent, include within their scope paroxetine hydrochloride. However, even one skilled in the art of patent interpretation cannot equate active substance with paroxetine hydrochloride. Yet the provisions of s. 4(2)(b) require that the patent contain a claim for the medicine itself i.e. a claim in the patent for the medicine itself when prepared or produced by the methods or processes of manufacture particularly described and claimed. That is not the case with the 393 patent and the 479 patent."], ["[22]", "Both the 393 patent and the 479 patent are process patents as defined by", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 171 (T.D.), at 175.

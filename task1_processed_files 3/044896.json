Later in the same examination, Dr. Van Etten stated (8T1555) that \"It's really about whether", "an expert in cancer biology", "at the time would have been able to reasonably infer, given the evidence, that PDGF and it's receptor were involved in certain types of cancer\" (emphasis added). These comments must be read in context. Having read the transcript in its entirety and his report, I am satisfied that, despite the first statement, Dr. Van Etten was well aware of the task of patent construction and the difference between an expert such as himself and the person of ordinary skill in the art. With respect to the second comment about the \"expert in cancer biology\", I observe that the notional skilled person, in this case and as discussed below, will have considerable expertise in medicinal chemistry. A person with such expertise may well be referred to as an \"expert\"."], ["[36]", "The other reason provided by the Plaintiffs is that Dr. Van Etten acted as an advocate for Novartis contrary to the role of an expert and contrary to the declaration made in accordance with Rule 52.2(1)(c) of the", "Federal Courts Rules,", "SOR/98-106. This submission is often made by a party when an expert provides an opinion that does not agree with its expert or its position on the evidence. The argument may, in some cases, have substance.

Maybe he should have been given this document - particularly since it was referred to by Dr. Rönnstrand in his report. However, in my opinion, this oversight is not sufficient reason to discount the entire testimony of Dr. Heldin. The alleged importance of ND250, and the results of a \"failed\" experiment on one of the compounds of the '203 Patent, is much exaggerated. The mere fact that Dr. Rönnstrand felt that this experiment was relevant does not necessarily make it so. This question is discussed in greater detail below."], ["[39]", "A similar argument is made by the Plaintiffs about certain summary internal Ciba-Geigy reports (ND151 and ND153) that were not provided to Dr. Heldin.

As I read the second part of the paragraph, containing the explicit reference to the Group 2 compounds, it is specifically outlining the selectivity of these particular compounds.

In doing so, Pfizer would show that its product met the definition of an \"invention\" set out in the Act. I am satisfied from the evidence that, at the priority date of the patent, it was expected that PDE inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of certain conditions. Scientists were looking for compounds that were more potent and selective cGMP inhibitors than were currently available. Accordingly, for Claim 6, Pfizer merely has to show that sildenafil had been demonstrated, or soundly predicted, to be useful simply by virtue of its capacity to act as a potent and selective cGMP PDE inhibitor.", "However, where the patent is more specific and claims that a compound is actually useful for the treatment of particular diseases and conditions, the patentee must show the compound's utility in those areas. Accordingly, for Pfizer's Claim 17 (which is a claim for the compounds' use in particular treatments), it must demonstrate actual utility, or establish that utility was soundly predictable, in those areas. But Pfizer can only be successful in defending Claim 17 if it succeeds in defending Claim 6. Proof of sildenafil's utility in the treatment of the conditions named in Claim 17 (i.e. angina, hypertension, heart failure or atherosclerosis), or a sound prediction that it would be useful for that purpose, is obviously dependent on proof that sildenafil was known (or soundly predicted) to be a potent and selective cGMP PDE inhibitor in 1990."], ["[179]", "As pointed out by the Plaintiffs, Justice O'Reilly did not follow this approach in the later decision of", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CPR (4th) 269.

In other words, the Plaintiffs are asserting that the '203 Patent should have disclosed that CGP 57148 was the best of the six compounds.

A fair characterization of Dr. Van Etten's evidence is that at least one of the individually claimed compounds could be used for the chemotherapy of tumours mediated by PDGF-R kinase or ABL kinase. However, Dr. Van Etten could not tell from reading the patent alone which compound or compounds are effective against tumours, let alone which compounds have activity against which tumours (TX 37, para 150; 8T1600-1608). The Plaintiffs argue that the inventor knew that imatinib had striking potency against ABL kinase, while other Group 2 compounds were more potent against PDGF-R kinase compared to ABL kinase.

All that is required by", "Sildenafil (SCC)", ", above at paragraph 70, is that the reader of the patent can discern what the invention is, how it works and how to make same successful use of the invention as the inventor could at the time he filed the patent. The omissions that the Plaintiffs complain of relate to distinctions that do not form part of the true invention. These alleged omissions reflect work that, for the most part, had yet to be done.

Section 27(3) is not meant to invalidate patents on the basis of distinctions which do not underlie the true invention.

As well, Ciba-Geigy had only performed one", "in vivo", "v-ABL dependent tumour experiment, which was inconclusive because of a solubility problem concerning CGP 53716 (see for example, Dr. Rönnstrand's testimony, 4T842-843). On this basis, it would have been impossible for the inventors to draw specific conclusions relating to the relative ability of Group 2 compounds to inhibit v-ABL and PDGF-R mediated tumours.

The identification of a solubility problem and the application of what is a routine modification in the testing protocol is, in my view, a matter of simple trial and error on the part of the person of ordinary skill in the art - and not, as argued by the Plaintiffs, a \"research project\".

In final argument, however, Novartis focussed only on: Claims 5, 7, 29; Claims 45 and 46 when read with any of these compound claims; and Claim 44. In final argument, Novartis referred to Claim 45. Claim 45 is a claim to the use of the compounds in the treatment of atherosclerosis. Novartis did not refer to this claim in its opening statement. In addition, evidence led during the trial addressed this use only peripherally. While I am not prepared to invalidate Claim 45, I am also not persuaded that I have a sufficient evidentiary base to declare it to be valid. Therefore, I find that, as between the parties, Claims 5, 7, 29, Claim 46 (when read with any of these compound claims) and Claim 44 are valid."], ["[406]", "For the reasons above, I have concluded that Novartis's claim for an injunction and delivery up of Apotex's remaining bulk imatinib is not warranted.

In preparing the papers, it is very helpful for the staff to estimate the length of time needed to discuss the case and the amount of work to be done by the members to make a summary. But it was a mistake of the staff to prejudge the case by calling it \"clearly predictable\" and by recommending to the board the opinion which it should form. That is undesirable because it might tempt the members of the board to take a short cut \"and not read the papers\" and merely rubber stamp the recommendation. The summary should outline the facts, the point in controversy and the issues. It should not tell the committee what the result should be.", "To my mind, these views are pertinent to the present discussion.

If the investigator's report is provided to the applicant before the final decision, there is no issue of fairness as this allows the parties to comment on the recommended findings. However, that is not what happened in the case at bar. The applicant was not provided with the Beckford Report, and as a result I think Ms. Beckford may have crossed the line in making a recommendation as to the final disposition of the file, which could be viewed as telling the Board what to do."], ["[34]", "This error, however, is not necessarily fatal to the final decision."], ["[35]", "Firstly, substantive portions of the Beckford Report were incorporated into the Board's pre-decision, which was described as a \"recommendation\" on the form on which it was drafted.

This statement by Member Dubreuil is not sufficient to convey reliance, since the problematic elements of the pre-decision, which relied upon the report, were nowhere to be found in the final decision. In addition, Member Dubreuil concluded that the applicant had \"not met the criteria for good conduct as set out in the Act given that [his] conduct has required the intervention of police since [his] last conviction.\" This conclusion, like that of Member Renault, can only refer to the 2009 impaired driving incident.", "VII.", "The Reasonableness of the Decision"], ["[40]", "The reasons for the final decision are contained near the end of the decision, where Member Renault stated the following:", "In conclusion and further to the review of your application and after carefully taking into consideration the representations of your attorney and the numerous letters of reference, the Board refuses to order the suspension of your criminal record.

Although the crimes of sexual assault and operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol may be factually distinct, they are both relevant to the consideration of the applicant's conduct, as both incidents were fuelled by his excessive alcohol consumption."], ["[52]", "As a final point, the applicant submits that the Board erred in not giving sufficient consideration to the letters of reference provided on his behalf by members of the community, as per subparagraph 17(h) of the Policy Manual. This is not supported by the decision itself, or by the evidence on the file. The Board referred to the letters of reference, but can draw on its broad discretion in the weight that it wishes to attribute to the letters."], ["[53]", "Moreover, there is no indication in the case of the applicant that the authors of the reference letters were aware of all the facts of the 2009 impaired driving incident, or that they were aware of alcohol being a factor in both incidents.

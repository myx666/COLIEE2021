In August 1990, Dr. Vanier terminated my research program in instrumental optics on the pretext that the lead responsibility for optics lied (sic) with the National Optics Institute. On the other hand, my co-workers who are White (sic), were allowed to continue doing optics work despite the existence of the National Optics Institute.", "\"3. In the fall of 1990, Dr. Vanier removed my name from the telephone directory of the Institute for National Measurement Standards.", "\"4. In November 1990, Dr. Vanier did not appoint me to any of the committees he formed. In October 1991, he did not appoint me to a group leader position.

I believe that Dr. Vanier who was the Chairman of the Selection Board, did not properly assess my experience and qualifications for this position.", "\"11. On September 18, 1991, Dr. Vanier negatively criticized my report on the San Diego trip via a memorandum he sent to Dr. Bedford.

It also set out several allegations of discrimination on the same grounds, as follows:", "\"1. Dr. Vanier forbade me to work in the field of holography in June and September 1991. However, he is allowing a white scientist to pursue experiments in holography. In March 1992, Dr. Bedford, my section head and supervisor, allowed this white scientist to use the material which I had originally purchased for my experiments in holography.", "\"2. Dr. Vanier has completely ignored the contribution I made with respect to the setting up of the Institute of Optics and did not assign me the work of setting up the metrology laboratory. I learned about the metrology project in the spring of 1992.", "\"3. In March 1992, Dr. Vanier had his secretary send me my 10-year service button without any reference to himself. Normally he presents these service buttons to the recipient.", "\"4. On 27 March 1992, Dr. Bedford gave me a work plan which is only a make-work project. Dr. Bedford advised me on 1 April 1992 that by allowing me to do this project and nothing else, he was only carrying on the instructions given to him by Dr. Vanier. However, white scientists are allowed to work on a number of projects.", "\"5. By memo dated 31 March 1992, I provided to Dr. Bedford my input to my work plan and indicated my serious concerns about it. Dr. Bedford and Dr. Vanier completely ignored my concerns and did not even reply to my memo and forced the work plan on me by writing to me in a memo dated 22 April 1992 'In any event, this will be your work plan.' Subsequently in reply to a reminder dated 15 June 1992, Dr. Bedford gave me an irrelevant and evasive response in his memo dated 25 June 1992. On 2 June 1992, Dr. Vanier assigned me without my concurrence an inferior work plan which according to his own document was written up for an entry level research officer. No other senior research officer has been assigned work without his or her concurrence.", "\"6. On 2 April 1992, I learned that Dr. Vanier has classified my position under 'section overhead'. No other scientist is classified under this code which only applies to secretarial services, telephones, faxes, building and other like services.", "\"7. On 2 April 1992, I examined my personal file and found documents which I had not seen before and which should not have been there. These contain a large number of letters which the National Research Council exchanged with Members of Parliament and ethnic organizations, regarding my dismissal by the Council in May 1991.", "\"8. In a memorandum dated 24 April 1992, Dr. Vanier advised me that I was not considered for promotion in September 1991 and that he was withholding my promotion again effective July 1992. He also informed me that a notification to me from Dr. Bedford dated 5 September 1991 advising me I was not considered for a promotion was never sent to me. I believe that hiding the decision about my promotion from me for almost nine months and denying me promotions in September 1991 and July 1992 are because of Dr. Vanier's prejudice against me.", "\"9. In May 1992, Drs. Vanier and Bedford refused to tell me about the nature of a meeting Dr. Vanier wanted me to attend on 20 May 1992; he did not allow me to bring a representative and refused to meet with me on a one-to-one basis. Dr. Vanier also ignored my suggestions for a meeting with me which I made in my memo to him dated 5 June 1992.", "\"10. In a memo dated 26 May 1992, Dr. Vanier criticised me for not attending the meeting on 20 May 1992, even though I had informed Dr. Bedford I would not attend without a representative.", "\"11. In a memo dated 2 June 1992, Dr. Vanier ordered me to report to Dr. Zwinkels every two months on the progress accomplished on the work plan assigned. Dr. Vanier does not treat white senior scientists in this manner.", "\"12. Dr. Vanier also asked Dr. Zwinkels to verbally state to me in presence of two witnesses what was contained in his memo of 2 June 1992. To the best of my knowledge, Dr. Vanier does not treat White (sic) senior scientists in this manner.", "\"13. In the memo dated 2 June 1992, Dr. Vanier also criticised me for not undertaking the duties assigned to me, and for not giving him my input and agreement on my work plan.", "\"14. The project 'Standards and Measurement Techniques - Fibre Optics', which Dr. Vanier assigned to me, has been promoted as a serious and worthwhile new initiative of the Institute for National Measurement Standards (INMS). In June 1992, I found out that this project, contrary to any new initiative, is not part of the 1992-93 Annual Plan of the INMS.", "\"15. The 1992-93 Annual Plan/Business Plan does not include my SPIE Fellowship award which I received on 24 July 1991 in San Diego and my selection in the summer 1991 as Guest Editor for the 'Optics in Canada' issue of", "Optical Engineering", ". Awards received by other staff members appear in a section to that effect.", "\"16. In the 1992-93 Annual Plan, it is stated 'The Optical Engineering Program with the Optical Components Shop will be integrated into the Mechanical Standards Section' of the INMS. The Annual Plan also shows that the optics activities at the INMS have increased. Whereas Dr. Vanier has been constantly increasing the optics activities of white scientists, he has consistently denied me the opportunity to do optics work from June 1991 to the present.", "\"By not assigning me any meaningful work, Dr. Vanier is humiliating me in order to force me to quit my job. He is forcing an inferior project on me through intimidation and threats of discharge. By not allocating adequate resources, he is also attempting to sabotage my performance and career. Dr. Vanier has created such a stressful and poisonous work environment for me at the work place that it has become necessary for me to stay away from work for health reasons. I was away on sick leave from October 1991 until mid-March 1992, and again at the end of April and beginning of May 1992 for three weeks. In an attempt to force me out of my job, Dr. Vanier has tried to force me to accept long term disability insurance.

It was not intended that there be a formal hearing preliminary to the decision as to whether to appoint a tribunal. Rather the process moves from the investigatory stage to the judicial or quasi-judicial stage if the test prescribed in s. 36(3)(a) is met. Accordingly, I conclude from the foregoing that, in view of the nature of the Commission's function and giving effect to the statutory provisions referred to, it was not intended that the Commission comply with the formal rules of natural justice.

It is sufficient for the Commission to be 'satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is warranted' (subsections 44(3) and 49(1)). This is a low threshold and the circumstances of this case are such that the Commission could have validly formed an opinion, rightly or wrongly, that there was 'a reasonable basis in the evidence for proceeding to the next stage' (", "Syndicat des employés de production du Québec et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Forest, J., in", "Cooper", ", supra, at page 891).\" [see footnote 5]"], ["[55]", "Later in the same case, the Court spoke about the high degree of deference assigned to the Commission when it deals with an investigation report.

Subsections 40(2) and 40(4) and sections 41 and 44 are replete with expressions such as 'is satisfied', 'ought to', 'reasonably available', 'could more appropriately be dealt with', 'all the circumstances', 'considers appropriate in the circumstances' which leave no doubt as to the intent of Parliament. The grounds set out for referral to another authority (subsection 44(2)), for referral to the President of the Human Rights Tribunal Panel (paragraph 44(3)(a)) or for an outright dismissal (paragraph 44(3)(b)) involve in varying degrees questions of fact, law and opinion (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at page 698, Le Dain, J.A.), but it may safely be said as a general rule that Parliament did not want the courts at this stage to intervene lightly in the decisions of the Commission.\" [see footnote 6]"], ["[56]", "In light of these authorities, it is apparent that a decision of the Commission to dismiss a complaint is an administrative, albeit discretionary, decision made within the limits of the", "Act", ". It was not intended that the Commission afford the broadest range of natural justice to complainants. Although the Applicant has characterized many of his arguments in terms of breaches of procedural fairness, that characterization is incorrect.

Specifically, the Applicant has not shown that he was deprived of an opportunity to respond to the evidence presented by the NRC. He was not entitled to an oral hearing before the Commission while that body was considering the investigation reports. The Commission is not required to embark upon an assessment of credibility when it reviews investigation reports."], ["[58]", "However, my findings concerning the failure of several arguments advanced by the Applicant do not inevitably lead to the conclusion that his present application is without merit.

On the other hand, Commission should not be assessing credibility in making these decisions, and they must be conscious of the simple fact that the dismissal of most complaints cuts off all avenues of legal redress for the harm which the person alleges.'\""], ["[61]", "The learned judge went on to comment on the circumstances where a party could successfully challenge the sufficiency of a investigator's report at pages 600-601, as follows:", "\"In contexts where parties have the legal right to make submissions in response to an investigator's report, such as in the case at bar, parties may be able to compensate for more minor omissions by bringing such omissions to the attention of the decision-maker. Therefore, it should be only where complainants are unable to rectify such omissions that judicial review would be warranted. Although this is by no means an exhaustive list, it would seem to me that circumstances where further submissions cannot compensate for an investigator's omissions would include: (1) where the omission is of such a fundamental nature that merely drawing the decision-maker's attention to the omission cannot compensate for it; or (2) where fundamental evidence is inaccessible to the decision-maker by virtue of the protected nature of the information or where the decision-maker explicitly disregards it.\""], ["[62]", "In", "Slattery", ", supra, the applicant alleged that some of the information required to support her complaint, which included a claim of systemic discrimination was difficult to obtain because it was protected by secrecy.

This is particularly the case where the applicant has the opportunity to fill in gaps left by the investigator in subsequent submissions of her own. In the absence of guiding regulations, the investigator, much like the CHRC, must be master of his own procedure, and judicial review of an allegedly deficient investigation should only be warranted where the investigation is clearly deficient.\""], ["[63]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Commission as follows, at page 201:", "\"The", "SEPQA", "decision has been followed and expanded upon by several Federal Court decisions. These decisions are to the effect that procedural fairness requires that the Commission have an adequate and fair basis upon which to evaluate whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant the appointment of a Tribunal. The investigations conducted by the investigator prior to the decision must satisfy at least two conditions: neutrality and thoroughness. In other words, the investigation must be conducted in a manner which cannot be characterized as biased or unfair and the investigation must be thorough in the sense that it must be mindful of the various interests of the parties involved. There is no obligation placed upon the investigator to interview each and every person suggested by the parties.

It is equally clear, in my opinion, that he was a critical witness if the investigation were to be thorough, in the sense of fairly examining both the Applicant's allegations and the NRC's responses to same. The omission of an interview with Dr. Vanier, an important party to the Applicant's employment situation, was of such a fundamental nature that its absence could not be relieved simply by drawing it to the attention of the decision-maker, that is the Commission. That is one of the tests for assessing the thoroughness of an investigation, according to", "Slattery", ", supra.

She based her complaint on the grounds of ethnic or national origin and age. Among other things, the complainant alleged that, following her departure from HRDC and the filing of her claim, the employer created various excuses to explain the non-renewal of her contract. The investigation report failed to deal with the complainant's theory in this regard. The Court made the following statement about this omission at paragraph 23:", "\"This omission is fundamental because any investigation of discrimination must, at minimum, ascertain who the decision-maker is and contain some inquiry into why that decision-maker decided the way they did. In this case, that would mean that the investigator should have investigated who actually decided not to renew the applicant's contract and why.

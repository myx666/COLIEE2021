If the physical test is not met, however, citizenship judges should, in my view, go on to consider the qualitative test.

If the intent had been to require physical presence for the full three years, it could easily have been expressed in the", "Act", ".

The former", "Act", "(R.S.C. 1970, c. C-19), contained two rules of residency. An applicant had to be resident in Canada for five out of the previous eight years (s. 10(1)(c)(i)) and for twelve out of the previous eighteen months (s. 10(1)(b)).

Not that time itself gives the test greater force. But if this approach was out of keeping with the legislative intent, the", "Act", "could have been amended long ago. It is true that amendments have recently been proposed, but they have not yet been enacted. I will say more about the proposed amendments below."], ["[16]", "Fourth, applicants for citizenship are expressly and officially advised that physical presence in Canada for three years is not strictly required. The Residence Questionnaire that must be completed by citizenship applicants states:", "\"The term 'residence', not being defined in the", "Citizenship Act", "or", "Regulations", ", requires that we turn to Federal Court decisions for interpretation and meaning. The Federal Court has ruled that residence in Canada for citizenship purposes is not strictly limited to actual physical presence. The concept of residence is rather the degree to which an applicant for citizenship settles into, maintains or centralizes his/her ordinary mode of living in Canada for the required 3-year period within the 4 years preceding the date of application. In other words, a person must demonstrate having established a home in Canada in which he/she is living and while outside of Canada, maintained sufficient ties and connections with Canada to suggest continuity of his/her residence in Canada.\""], ["[17]", "While this instruction is not legally binding, it would obviously be unfair to applicants if they were denied citizenship on the basis that they did not satisfy the three-year residence requirement according to the physical test after having been told that the test is qualitative. In addition, it would be peculiar if citizenship judges took an approach that conflicted with that which is set out in the very documentation they must consider in deciding whether an applicant should succeed."], ["[18]", "Fifth, the qualitative test is consistent with proposals to amend the", "Act", ".

In respect of the residence requirement for citizenship, these instruments have all contained a provision stipulating that a period of residence of three years during the previous six are necessary. \"Residence\" would be defined as physical presence in Canada."], ["[19]", "On the one hand, these amendments would enact a form of physical test that is potentially stricter than the qualitative test, as they would require a minimum period of physical presence in Canada. On the other hand, however, the physical test proposed is far less strict than that which would apply if the current Act were interpreted as requiring in all cases actual physical presence for three years out of four. The proposed amendments are consistent with a recognition that considerable flexibility should be built into the residence requirement and, in my view, that flexibility is achieved by way of the qualitative test set out in the jurisprudence of this Court."], ["[20]", "Sixth, it strikes me that this is a situation where a statutory ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the individual. No doubt, many persons with aspirations to become Canadian citizens order their affairs according to the language of the", "Act", ", the preponderance of the jurisprudence of this Court and the instructions they receive from Canadian officials, all of which would point in the direction of a qualitative standard for determining residence. It would be rather harsh, in my view, for the Court to apply a different standard at this stage of the process on appeals by the Minister from decisions approving applications for citizenship."], ["[21]", "Accordingly, I find that the qualitative test set out in", "Papadogiorgakis", "and elaborated upon in", "Koo", "should be applied where an applicant has not met the physical test.

The question is when? Given that he applied for citizenship in March 2001, he would have to show that he established his residence in Toronto sometime during or before March 1998 in order to satisfy the three-year requirement. However, in March 1998 Mr. Nandre was in India, accompanied by his wife. The only time he was in Canada prior to March 1998 was during that first month in the fall of 1997. However, I see very little evidence that residence was established at that point. Most of the connections that the family made in Canada - professional, financial and educational - appear to have been established later than that, after they returned to Canada in the spring of 1998. The brief visit to Toronto in October 1997 appears to have been an initial foray, perhaps simply to secure an apartment."], ["[28]", "In the absence of evidence showing that residence was established in October 1997, and without a specific finding by the Citizenship Judge to that effect, I must allow this appeal.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[29]", "IT IS HEREBY ADJUDGED THAT:", "1.

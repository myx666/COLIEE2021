He was also a person who was often involved in field operations and as an officer who commanded units engaged in counter-insurgency operations, the male claimant must have known about the crimes that have been widely reported by the media and by human rights organizations.

He was placed there when he was 13 years old by his uncle and tutor. He remained in the army voluntarily and pursued a career, rising first to the rank of corporal and then sergeant. In May 1984, the principal applicant received counter-insurgency training in Honduras. The purpose of this training was to learn how to fight against guerillas in the mountains. He received further training in El Salvador, at the Atlacatl Immediate Response Battalion, to enable him to teach experienced soldiers tactical manoeuvres and the use of weapons. He acted as an instructor at the Atlacatl Battalion for a period of six to eight months during which he trained approximately 2,000 soldiers. While acting as an instructor, he continued to participate in combat missions. His role was to draft the plan of action and then to carry out the attack. In 1984-1985, he was the chief of a combat patrol, with 14 men under his command. He operated in the eastern and northern sections of El Salvador. The panel referred to documentary evidence before it which indicated that in December of 1981, the Atlacatl Battalion had been responsible for killing 794 persons and in 1989 for the murder of six Jesuit priests and two women. At the actual date of these events, the principal applicant was not a member of that battalion or associated with it."], ["[14]", "The principal applicant did not leave the army until 1988 and then he did so because he wished to spend more time with his family. He had married in early 1988. He was given an honourable discharge in December of 1988 and remained a member of the army reserve. In the light of all this evidence, the panel concluded that although the principal applicant knew of the international offenses being committed he did not disassociate himself from the army at any time but accepted positions of higher responsibility. I quote some of the panel's conclusions in this regard:", "\"... He did not disassociate himself from the army at that time. On the contrary, the fact that he accepted positions of higher responsibility, like the training of members of the Atlacatl Battalion, the planning of operations or the command of units on the field, in the panel's view, means that the male claimant accepted the approach taken by the army, associated himself with the leaders of the armed forces and, by lending his technical knowledge and his energies, willingly cooperated in the organization and execution of operations, knowing that they could result in the commission of international crimes and that, in fact, sometimes resulted in such crimes being committed. From what the claimant stated at his hearing, he was a middle ranking officer, who had knowledge, experience and dedication to his work and, therefore, part of a limited group of people who made the army function.", "\"The panel took into consideration the fact that the army is not an organization 'principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose'. In fact, the panel believes that the Salvadoran army has a legitimate function in defending the country from aggression, be it internal or external. Therefore, mere membership in the army may not by necessity involve personal and knowing participation in persecutorial acts. However, given that the male claimant was involved in counter-insurgency operations, and particularly in the planning of those operations, and that the international crimes committed by the army were linked to counter-insurgency operations, and sometimes part of the strategy used in the execution of counter-insurgency operations, it is not possible to conclude that the male claimant was not an accomplice in the crimes committed by the army. Even if the claimant, as testified, did not hurt anyone with his own hands, the panel finds that, by embracing the goals of the army and by lending his effective support, he also accepted the darker aspects of the operations conducted by the army and became an accomplice in the international crimes committed by the army. ...\" (footnotes omitted)"], ["[15]", "As I have already indicated, I do not think the panel erred in concluding that there exist serious reasons for considering that the principal applicant had committed or been complicit in the commission of international offenses.", "Assessment Of Dependent", "Applicant's Claim"], ["[16]", "Counsel for the applicants argues that the panel erred because it did not assess whether or not the principal applicant would have been entitled to Convention refugee status had he not fallen into the category described in art.

Considering that he had been given an honourable discharge and that he had not experienced problems during his active service in the army and while residing in El Salvador after leaving the army, it seems more logical to believe that the male claimant was sought by the military because he was a member of the reserve and was under obligation to report for service when called. ...", ". . . . .", "\"The fact that the female claimant was not contacted by the army while she was in El Salvador, at a time when her husband was allegedly sought by the military, is a further reason that that persuades the panel that there is not a reasonable chance that she would be persecuted in El Salvador by the military.

She was not contacted, even though her address in Santa Tecla was listed in her husband's military records after they were married in March 1988.

In my view, in the context of the initial determination as to whether or not status will be granted, the question is a different one.

I do not think the CRDD panels need to engage in that type of conceptual analysis. I think it is sufficient for them to weigh the evidence of changed country conditions in the balance with all the other evidence before them in assessing an applicant's claim. As I have noted, I think the difference which it is alleged to exist between the decisions of the members of this court is more apparent than real. For example, when a panel is weighing changed country conditions together with all the evidence in a applicant's case, factors such as durability, effectiveness and substantiality are still relevant. The more durable the changes are demonstrated to be, the heavier they will weigh against granting the applicant's claim. In addition, if a panel has in fact made a determination that status would have existed but for changed circumstances (that is, if it has voluntary adopted that type of conceptual analysis) then a more rigorous assessment of the changed conditions following the criteria set out by Professor Hathaway will likely be appropriate.

But, in any event, even if the conclusions of the tribunal were correct, we do not accept that they can be advanced without more explanation to establish that the appropriate legal principles were applied. The applicant's claim was not properly dealt with and the decision cannot be allowed to stand.\""], ["[34]", "The", "Cuadra", "case also dealt with a Board decision which the court found lacked sufficient explanation (pp. 2-3):", "\"The panel held that while the appellant had a subjective fear of persecution, the claim was not objectively well-founded. The principal consideration relating to the objective basis for the claim was the change of circumstances in Nicaragua and, in particular, the election of Chamarro [sic]. The panel pondered whether the continued presence of Ortega as chief of the military constituted a threat to former Contras which was knowingly tolerated by the new government. It found that, according to the documentary evidence, the Chamorro government was moving cautiously. However, this did not mean that the oppressive Sandinista regime remained. The panel conceded that the appellant received harsh treatment by his captors in July of 1990 and that the Sandinistas continued to play a role in the military and politics of Nicaragua. However, the Chamarro [sic] government had taken positive steps to reduce the influence of the Sandinistas. In the result, the claim lacked an objective basis.", "\"We have come to the conclusion that this decision of the Board cannot be allowed to stand. It contains too many conflicting conclusions to be satisfactory. The Tribunal, as mentioned above, found that the appellant was perfectly credible, so it accepted without any reservation that he was captured and mistreated by soldiers because of his prior involvement with the Contras. It simply reasoned that this did not provide a basis for a refugee claim as the 'claimant was a hapless victim of overzealousness by military forces'. Surely more detailed commentary was required. Could the Chamorro government put a curb on this 'overzealousness' given that Sandinista control of the military remained? Moreover, after affirming that the Sandinistas continued to play a role in the military and political scheme in Nicaragua, the tribunal found that a change in circumstances undermined the claim on the basis that 'the documentary evidence points to positive steps taken and progress made towards that objective [of diminishing the influence of the Sandinistas]'. Again, a more detailed analysis of the conflicting evidence in respect of a change in circumstances was necessary to meet the requirement that the change be meaningful and effective enough to render the genuine fear of the appellant unreasonable and hence without foundation.", "See to the same effect:", "Ali Ahmed and M.E.I.", ", decision of July 14, 1993, unreported, File A-89-92.\""], ["[35]", "I do not read Mr. Justice Marceau's comments in", "Cuada", "as a departure from the method of analysis which was set out by the Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .

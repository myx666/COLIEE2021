However, the officer feels that this factor carries little weight and cannot justify an exemption. Further, the officer indicates that the male applicant has paid his taxes, has been renting a 4 ½ apartment for a year, purchased furniture, has a bank account, and owns a car.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The officer notes that while the updated H & C application states that the male applicant lives with his sister, he does not however answer the question regarding the people with whom he lives. He states that he has a sister and sister-in-law in Canada, however, the officer considers that the evidence on file does not allow her to evaluate the relationship with them. Consequently, it does not appear that the male applicant would suffer particular hardship if he had to leave his sister and sister-in-law behind to return to Lebanon, where the majority of his siblings live.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The officer therefore concludes that, if they had to return to Lebanon for the time required to comply with the Act, the applicants would be able to obtain moral and logistical support while waiting for a response to their visa application. Further, the male applicant did not present evidence of his integration into the community through involvement in community or religious organizations, volunteer work, study or other similar activities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The officer is of the view that the applicants have developed only weak ties to Canadian society.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "With respect to the best interests of the three Canadian-born children, the officer indicates that there is no evidence on file indicating whether the children go to school or daycare or whether they participate in any social, sporting, or cultural activities. From this, the officer concluded that they stay with their parents. The officer feels that their return to Lebanon with their parents to a milieu where they would be in contact with other members of their family (grandparents, aunts, and uncles) would not cause them unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. The evidence on file does not allow the officer to determine whether the applicants' children have Lebanese citizenship or whether they could obtain it.

Thus, the officer gives little weight to this letter.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "The officer concludes that the applicants did not provide any further evidence to allow her to come to a different conclusion than that of the Tribunal. And that although the risk assessment of an H & C application is more general than that carried out for a claim for refugee protection or an application for a PRRA, the fact remains that the applicants did not present any credible or reliable evidence of risk should they have to return to their country to apply for immigrant visas as required by the Act.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "Further, the officer states that while the situation in the country was worrying, documentary sources indicate that the situation in Lebanon has stabilized since the ceasefire and that the nature of the political tensions still existing are no longer a threat to the life or security of the applicants.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "In light of this information, and the fact that the officer gives little weight to the male applicant's alleged problems with Hezbollah, it is the officer's opinion that he failed to demonstrate that he would face a personalized risk to his life or security if returned to Lebanon.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "ISSUES  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "This application raises the following issues:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "a.

Second, where the first inquiry proves unfruitful, courts must proceed to an analysis of the factors making it possible to identify the proper standard of review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "With respect to the first issue, the question of whether the officer applied the correct legal test is one of law and has previously been found to be reviewable on the standard of correctness (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J.

No. 882 (QL), at para. 1:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Although the distinction in fact may not always be apparent, there is a clear distinction in law between a pre-removal risk assessment and an application for permanent residence from within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "Indeed, while both applications take risk into account, in the context of a PRRA, the consideration of the \"\"risk\" as per section 97 of IRPA involves assessing whether the applicant would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 7) while in the context of an H & C application, \"risk should be addressed as but one of the factors relevant to determining whether the applicant would face", "unusual, and undeserved or disproportionate hardship", ".

No. 749 (QL), at para.12). The expression of the standard as \"unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship,\" is instructive: \"[t] he H & C process is not designed to eliminate hardship; it is designed to provide relief from unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship.\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at para. 26). Indeed, it has been held repeatedly by this Court that the \"[h] ardship that is inherent in having to leave Canada is not enough\" to ground an H & C claim (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J.

This is the correct expression of the test, which was carried out with reference to the separation from relatives in Canada, location of relatives in Lebanon, and the children's access to education and health services.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "In the section of the H & C decision entitled \"Personalized Risk\", the officer refers repeatedly to risk to the life and security of the applicant which is an incorrect formulation of the hardship test in the context of an H & C. However, the officer does state that \"[a] lthough the risk assessment of this application is more general that that carried out for a claim for refugee protection or an application for a PRRA, the fact remains that the applicant did not present any credible or reliable evidence of risk\". Subsequently, the officer briefly reviews the general security situation in Lebanon but concludes that the natures of the political tensions that do exist are not a threat to the life or security of the applicants. The officer concludes her reasons by stating that she is not satisfied that the applicants would experience unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if they applied for permanent residence abroad.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "The Court is aware that the applicants themselves raised the issue of personalized risk in their H & C submissions, both in the April 7, 2004 application, and the February 22, 2007 update. For example, in the April 7th submissions, on the supplementary information form, in answer to the question \"Explain why there might be special reasons to exempt you from this requirement and allow you to apply from within Canada for permanent residence\", the male applicant indicates:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "I fear for my safety and that of the safety of my two Canadian children. It is not safe for me to be in Lebanon. It is a very dangerous place. My Canadian children would be deprived of proper healthcare and education which they would have in Canada.", "The Hezbollah terrorists are still after me, as I refused to spy for them.", "[Emphasis added.]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "Further, in response to the question \"What excessive hardship will you suffer if you have to submit your application at a visa office outside Canada as required by law?\", the applicant writes:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "As mentioned above, my life would be in danger and so would my Canadian children.", "They would be too young to leave behind and my children who are Canadians would not have the benefits of medicine and education that they have in Canada.

In the present case, given that the applicants raised the issue of risk to life, it is not fatal to the decision that the officer responds to the applicants' fear by evaluating this risk (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 1843 (QL), at para. 26).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[32]", "However, the officer not only carries out a PRRA-type risk to life analysis in the context of the Hezbollah allegations, but also employs the same terminology when focusing on the general country conditions. Given this inconsistency, The Court is unable to determine which standard was in fact employed. The hardship evaluation must include whether the country conditions may expose an applicant to unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. As the exact test employed by the officer for this evaluation remains unclear, this Court finds that this constitutes a reviewable error sufficient to grant the application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Did the officer err in her analysis of the best interests of the children?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[33]", "The best interests of the child are an important factor to be considered in the analysis of an H & C application.

For all practical purposes, the officer's task is to determine, in the circumstances of each case, the likely degree of hardship to the child caused by the removal of the parent and to weigh this degree of hardship together with other factors, including public policy considerations, that militate in favor of or against the removal of the parent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[35]", "In the present case, the Court finds that the officer was alert, alive, and sensitive to the best interests of the children. The officer took into consideration their ages, activities, location of wider family circle, and cognizant that no medical problems or special treatments had been alleged by the applicants.

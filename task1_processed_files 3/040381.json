Specifically, the Judge found that the Applicant was short 978 days of the minimum requirement.

He required that the Applicant demonstrate 1,095 days of physical presence in Canada. The Applicant was not just a few days short; the evidence demonstrates that he was absent from Canada for all but 117 days in the four year period prior to his application for citizenship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The Federal Court has, over the years, endorsed three different approaches to the question of how to interpret the words \"resident\" and \"residence\" in the legislation. Briefly stated, the three lines of jurisprudence fall into two categories: the \"quantitative approach\" and the \"qualitative approach\". The quantitative approach is encompassed in the", "Re Pourghasemi", "test, applied by the Citizenship Judge in this case, which asks whether the applicant has been physically present in Canada for 1,095 days out of the last four years. This has been referred to as the \"physical presence\" test.

His decision differs from the others cited because, for the first time, a judge of our Court conducted an exacting analysis of s. 5(1)(c) using well-established modern principles of statutory interpretation. Justice Rennie concluded that application of the principles of statutory interpretation supports the physical presence test, and not the qualitative approach. Even if I might quibble with his characterization of the standard of review as correctness, his analysis and conclusion are compelling. I adopt his reasons and conclusion on this question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "In sum, on this issue, the Citizenship Judge did not err by applying the physical presence test.

The Applicant passed the knowledge test even though he believes that the Judge improperly suggested incorrect answers. Finally, the slight delay in providing the official decision to the Applicant was not material.

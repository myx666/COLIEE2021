He was not satisfied that her prior experience was either sufficient or properly supported by credible documentary evidence. The Applicant's admission during the interview constitutes sufficient evidence to support the Visa Officer's conclusion and I would agree with the Visa Officer's assessment of the arranged employment. In addition, the fact that the Applicant's initial application contained no reference whatsoever to any experience in the area, and the fact of her changing testimony on her employment history provide further support to his conclusion.

When asked if Sheila was connected to her brother-in-law, Hector Chirinos, she said no, just a friend of a friend. She was asked if she ever visited the location and she said no. She was asked why the information on her application for a temporary resident visa matched Sheila Sattler's address exactly and there was no response.

Under normal circumstances, I cannot see how misrepresentations with respect to a job offer that no longer exists could be \"material\" or could induce an error in the administration of the IRPA. Thus, I am inclined to ignore those findings, even though they add to the pattern of falsehoods that make up the fabric of this Applicant's dealings with the Visa Officer.

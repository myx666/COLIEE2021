Mr. Emamgongo was a student at the University of Kinshasa until it was shut down on May 17, 1990 following a deadly student march in which he participated. He then took up employment in the hospital morgue. On January 7, 1991 Mr. Emamgongo allegedly found the body of his uncle among the tortured corpses that the Mbotu regime periodically sent to the morgue. The applicant informed the leader of the UDPS of his discovery which led to his dismissal on January 16, 1991 and to his arrest and imprisonment. Mr. Emamgongo was beaten during his 6 month imprisonment but escaped after he was referred to the hospital for treatment.

The respondent also stated, as he had before the IAD, that he had informed the Canadian visa officer who processed his application in Gabon that Ms. Bayonne was his common law partner, but the officer apparently advised him not to state in his application that she was residing in France and that the time required to establish their cohabitation would slow down the processing of his claim for refugee status considerably.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "The respondent states that his family is suffering from the current situation and that he has difficulty understanding the refusal by the Canadian authorities and the Minister's application for judicial review, which are unduly delaying the reunification of his family.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The applicable standard of review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "As mentioned above, the Minister's first argument is that in its decision to recognize the status of common law partner, the IAD failed to take into consideration the contradictory evidence in the file and rendered its decision based on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner without regard to the material before it.

The Minister is essentially relying on two facts in support of its argument that the evidence has been weighed unreasonably, namely, the respondent's declaration in his 2004 permanent residence application that he had no common law partner, and the conflicting addresses provided in the permanent residence applications.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[35]", "The respondent testified at length about the circumstances surrounding his 2004 declaration. His testimony is clear on this point (at pages 192 to 195 of the IAD record), and he convinced the IAD that his testimony was credible and truthful. The respondent states that the Gabonese authorities responsible for refugee protection in Gabon were controlled to a great extent by the local government, which itself had close ties with the Congolese authorities. Moreover, his brother (Translation) \"was the representative for African refugees in Gabon, so he did not have good relations with the HCR authorities\". The UNHCR authorities therefore informed him that there was a limit of four family members that his brother could declare. This is an astonishing statement, but the IAD accepted it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[36]", "A letter from Serge Boussamba-Moutinga dated July 7, 2009, was also filed by the respondent before the IAD (pages 111-112 of the IAD record), confirming this policy of limiting the number of family members that could be declared by those defending the rights of refugees. Mr. Moutinga stated that he was the former President of the Gabon chapter of the Commission on African Refugees and the Community Development Officer for ALISEI-UNHCR in Gabon during the period in question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[37]", "The respondent adds that during his interview with the immigration officer from Abidjan, he would have declared Ms. Bayonne as his common law partner, but he had to abandon the idea of declaring this on his form, as he could provide no evidence of cohabitation, which, in Gabon, would have required applying in person to city hall for a certificate with photos and signatures. As Ms. Bayonne was in France, it was impossible for him to provide the required proof of cohabitation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[38]", "The IAD therefore disregarded the respondent's statements in his 2004 permanent residence application, preferring to accept his oral testimony about the circumstances surrounding this declaration. The IAD is entitled to significant deference in its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[39]", "The IAD attaches little weight to the discrepancy between the addresses declared in the respondent's and Ms. Bayonne's written applications. Ms. Bayonne declared her residence from 2001 to 2003 to have been the Libreville neighbourhood known as PK8, which was the neighbourhood where her family lived rather than the one where she cohabited with the respondent. The IAD accepted that this discrepancy was a mistake and provided the following explanation:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"[11] The Panel notes the inconsistency of the addresses given on the applications for permanent residency and sponsorship by the Appellant and the Applicant.

The explanations given by the Appellant regarding his unfamiliarity with the terminology used such as common law partner and conjugal partner were plausible. The Panel accepts that written documentary proof of cohabitation such as a joint lease easily available in Canada may be more difficult to obtain in another country where rental arrangements may not be formalized by a written agreement. The couple have been together since 2001 and have a five-year-old child. The Applicant is expecting their second child. They have been married, albeit in a customary marriage, since January 2004.

It would therefore be inappropriate for this Court to intervene, given the limits on judicial review set by the Supreme Court of Canada  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "and", "Khosa", ".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[41]", "The Minister nevertheless raises a third issue, namely, the fact that the respondent and Ms. Bayonne have not cohabited since September 2003. If I understand the Minister's submission correctly, as the two individuals in question lived apart, Ms. Bayonne in France and the respondent in Gabon or Canada from September 2003 to March 2007, they no longer meet the definition of \"common law partner\" in the", "Regulations", ", which reads as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"1(1) The definitions in this subsection apply in the Act and in these Regulations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "'common law partner' means, in relation to a person, an individual who is cohabiting <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[42]", "According to the Minister, the phrase \"who is cohabiting\" requires that the cohabitation be contemporaneous to the application for permanent residence under the family class. In this case, the individuals in question had been living apart for four years when Ms. Bayonne filed her sponsored application for permanent residence in 2007.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[43]", "The interpretation of this definition proposed by the Minister is inconsistent with the Minister's own departmental policy, entitled, \"OP 2 Processing Members of the Family Class\", dated November 14, 2006, and filed at the hearing. This policy document addresses precisely this question at page 27: \"How can someone in Canada sponsor a common law partner from outside Canada when the definition says 'is cohabiting'?\" The policy provides the following answer:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"According to case law, the definition of common law partner should be read as 'an individual who is (ordinarily) cohabiting'. After the one year period of cohabitation has been established, the partners may live apart for periods of time without legally breaking the cohabitation. For example, a couple may have been separated due to armed conflict, illness of a family member, or for employment or education-related reasons, and therefore do not cohabit at present (see also 5.44 for information on persecution and penal control). Despite the break in cohabitation, a common law relationship exists if the couple has cohabited continuously in a conjugal relationship in the past for at least one year and intend to do so again as soon as possible. There should be evidence demonstrating that both parties are continuing the relationship, such as visits, correspondence, and telephone calls.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"This situation is similar to a marriage where the parties are temporarily separated or not cohabiting for a variety of reasons, but still considers themselves to be married and living in a conjugal relationship with their spouse with the intention of living together as soon as possible. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[44]", "Although this Court is not bound by the policy in its interpretation of the", "Regulations", "and the definition of \"common law partner\", I consider this excerpt of the policy to be an accurate statement of the applicable law. This approach calls for case-by-case consideration and applies not only in respect of common law partners where one of the partners is in Canada but also in respect of common law partners outside Canada who may find themselves separated due to all kinds of life circumstances. I note that these circumstances may be particularly trying for those awaiting a decision on their claims for refugee status.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[45]", "In this case, the IAD's finding is clear:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"[7] The Appellant testified that he has visited the Applicant twice since she returned to France and that she and their son have visited him in Canada.

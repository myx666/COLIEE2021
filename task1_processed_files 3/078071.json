Her accusations were far ranging and in particular, she alleged that she had been harassed and humiliated by management and her own union president. In responding to the Report, the Applicant described another incident that she desired to add to the Complaint. She alleged that, in a public notice of implementation of a grievance decision, the union president had deliberately misspelled her name \"BagnaHo\" - the allegation is that there was a sexual connotation (or intended humiliation) in the misspelling. This allegation was the subject of a separate grievance and complaint to the Canadian Industrial Relations Board [CIRB]."], ["[9]", "On April 3, 2013, the Commission issued its Decision.

The Applicant took grave exception to the reference in the Report regarding the pending grievances and the fact that some had been withdrawn or settled."], ["[11]", "In deciding not to proceed with the Complaint, the Commission considered a number of factors; the principal ones being:", "• the decision maker on any grievance would be a neutral and independent labour arbitrator;", "• while noting the Applicant's objections to the grievance process, the Commission's task was to assess the accessibility of alternate redress mechanisms; not to assess the merits of her objections;", "• the Applicant did not indicate that she is vulnerable or that pursuing the grievance procedure would cause her harm;", "• a labour arbitrator has jurisdiction to interpret and apply the Act; and", "• a labour arbitrator can award much the same kind of remedies as those available under the Act."], ["[12]", "There is only one issue: was the Commission's Decision reasonable?", "III.", "Analysis"], ["[13]", "The situation and governing legal principles in this case are much the same as in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 131.

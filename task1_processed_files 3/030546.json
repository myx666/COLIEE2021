What the applicant does, how he organizes his priorities, what priorities he sets in his life, how he spends his time and what he does on his weekends, what applications he files all these are very personal decisions that the Court or the respondent should not question not (sic) interfere with. To assume otherwise would mean that, under the guise of the timelines included in the Rules, the decision makers at 90 Sparks and the respondent's counsel will decide how applicant lives his life and dictate on him a certain way of life.", "22.

When provided with the opportunity to file further submissions through his reply to the Respondent's motion record, he argued that it would be counterproductive to address this requirement. I agree with Prothonotary Tabib that this argument is ill-founded. As the law stands, someone seeking an extension of time must establish that the underlying proceeding has some merit. This is a relevant jurisprudential consideration. Ignoring it is simply not a valid approach. With no more needing to be said on this issue I turn now to the Applicant's arguments regarding his affidavit in support of his judicial review application."], ["[26]", "The Applicant's contention that the affidavit he prepared in support of his judicial review application provides a tenable basis to sustain the meritorious nature of his judicial review application does not assist the Applicant.

She found that it lacked specificity and did not satisfy the Court that even the low threshold of merit had been met. Indeed, the Applicant's Notice of Application consists of a series of general assertions making undiscernible the merits, if any, of the Applicant's grounds for seeking judicial review of the impugned decision."], ["[28]", "In sum, to paraphrase Justice Roy's order in docket T-550-13 referred to above, which for all intents and purposes was confirmed on appeal on November 21, 2014 (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED), the Court would at least have expected the Applicant to try to satisfy the requirement that his judicial review application has some merit. He clearly did not. As a result, I see no reason to interfere with Prothonotary Tabib's finding that this requirement of the", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "test has not been met in this case."], ["[29]", "The same is true regarding Prothonotary Tabib's conclusion that the Applicant's explanation, for the delay in filing his application record, is not acceptable. As she correctly points out, the Applicant's justification for obtaining such an extension of time is that he does not have the time or the resources to meet the deadlines prescribed by the Rules as he is facing competing demands of family, work, duties a union officer, job applications, studies and other on-going court cases he is involved in. Prothonotary Tabib found that this was not an appropriate justification for delay explaining that it boils down to the Applicant making his own choices and establishing his own order of priorities, regardless of the Rules."], ["[30]", "Again, I see no basis for intervention here. It seems to me that the Applicant's underlying rationale for his request for extension of time stems from a profound misconception of the Rules. They are not, as the Applicant suggests in his material, \"administrative requirements\", which implies that they are mere non-binding guidelines. The Rules have force of law. They are adopted pursuant to sections 45.1 and 46 of the", "Federal", "Courts Act", "(RSC, 1985, c F-7). These provisions provide for a detailed, comprehensive rules' adoption process lead by a committee, the Rules Committee, composed of the Chief Justices of the Federal Court of Appeal and of the Federal Court, three judges of the Federal Court of Appeal and five judges and one Prothonotary of the Federal Court, the Chief Administrator of the Courts Administrative Service and the Attorney General of Canada or a representative thereof. The Rules Committee is also composed of five members of the bar of any province designated by the Attorney General of Canada, after consultation with the Chief Justices of the Federal Courts. These members are to be representative of the different regions of Canada and have experience in the areas of jurisdiction of the Federal Courts."], ["[31]", "According to that process, where the Rules Committee proposes to amend, vary or revoke any Rule, it must publish its proposals in the Canada Gazette so that any interested person may comment on them. The Rules, or any proposal to amend, vary or revoke any Rule, are also subject to the approval of the Governor in Council and, once approved, they are laid before each House of Parliament."], ["[32]", "The Rules are therefore carefully crafted binding legal instruments that apply equally to all litigants coming before the Federal Courts, including self-represented litigants (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[33]", "Claiming that the Rules are made for litigants that have time and money to pursue litigation, or that they are mere guidelines, proceeds from an ill-informed and unfair characterization of the Rules and is certainly no valid explanation for delay."], ["[34]", "It is true that in certain circumstances, an extension of time will still be granted even if one of the criteria is not satisfied, but in this case, given the nature of the explanation for delay provided by the Applicant, I see no reason to interfere with Prothonotary Tabib's decision in this regard."], ["[35]", "In sum, I am in full agreement with Prothonotary Tabib's statement that granting extensions of time for no other reason than to suit a litigant's own sense of priorities, which is clearly the case of the Applicant as evidenced by his own written submissions, is not in the interests of justice. I would therefore dismiss the Applicant's appeal on this point.", "B. The Rule 55 Request"], ["[36]", "The Applicant requests to be dispensed of the obligation to file three copies on his application record and allowed to file a single copy or, in the alternative, be granted a further extension of time (i.e. until July 2015) to file his record in order to garner the necessary funds to pay for duplication. Prothonotary Tabib dismissed this request on the ground that the Applicant had not shown that he was impecunious or would be unable to pursue a meritorious claim without that accommodation."], ["[37]", "The Applicant claims that with his current earnings and expenses, he can only put money aside to finance his court cases when he has three paydays in a month, instead of two; something that occurs only twice a year. The evidence before Prothonotary Tabib was that the Applicant's had a net monthly salary of approximately $2,800."], ["[38]", "I have not been persuaded that Prothonotary Tabib misapprehended the facts or applied a wrong principle in deciding as she did. She noted that the Applicant's Rule 55 request also boils down to his own choices and priorities when it comes to the allocation of his resources and I cannot say that she is \"clearly wrong\" on that point."], ["[39]", "I would add that the Applicant, of his own admission, lacks any interest in deriving any financial benefit from the underlying judicial review application and any employment opportunity. His sole interest in pursuing these proceedings rests on \"purely on moral grounds\" and on his desire to advance the jurisprudence in the public interest. If that is indeed the case, then there is nothing to prevent the Applicant from seeking a financial contribution from those on behalf of whom he seeks to advance the jurisprudence.", "C. The Order Providing for the Dismissal of the Underlying Judicial Review Application"], ["[40]", "Prothonotary Tabib ruled that since the relief sought by the Applicant under Rules 8 and 55 had been denied, it followed that if the Applicant failed to serve and file his application record within the deadlines contemplated by the Rules (as may be extended by consent or by order of this Court upon further motion brought prior to the expiration of the delay and on grounds that have arisen after the date of the order), the Applicant would be in default of filing his application record, making the continuation of the underlying judicial review application impossible. Relying on Rule 168, which provides that the Court may dismiss a proceeding where, following an order of the Court it is not possible to continue the proceeding and in order to \"dispel any misunderstanding and avoid a waste of the parties and the Court's time\", Prothonotary Tabib ordered that should the Applicant be in default of filing his application record as per the terms of her order, the underlying application would be dismissed."], ["[41]", "The Applicant claims that Prothonotary Tabib had no jurisdiction to make that order. I disagree. According to Rule 50, a Prothonotary may \"hear, and make any necessary order relating to, any motion under these Rules\" other than those expressly excluded by that Rule. Rule 168 is not part of the exclusions. Furthermore, \"Court\" is defined in section 2 of the Rules as meaning,", "inter alia", ", \"the Federal Court, including a prothonotary acting within the jurisdiction conferred under these Rules\". Therefore, there is no basis to the Applicant's jurisdictional argument."], ["[42]", "As the Respondent points out, the \"dismissal\" component of Prothonotary Tabib's order was within her jurisdiction as a necessary corollary to her denial of the Applicant's request for an extension of time. Indeed, it was a necessary corollary as a measure to both advance the underlying judicial review application, which, as a matter of principle must proceed expeditiously, and prevent an abuse of the Court's process resulting from the Applicant's approach to the Rules in general as well as from his approach to status review as a means of getting, indirectly, what was specifically refused to him."], ["[43]", "As the Respondent also correctly points out, the Order was not made to pre-empt the final decision to be made on the underlying judicial review application. The Applicant was still allowed to pursue his proceedings and to seek, although under stricter conditions, further delays. In this regard, Prothonotary Tabib's order, as a whole, had some measure of flexibility."], ["[44]", "It became clear however, at the hearing of the present appeal on February 4, 2015, that these options were not acceptable to the Applicant. He maintained that his proceedings would only advance if he could proceed under the terms set out in his motion. Given the Applicant's \"my way or no way\" approach to these proceedings, clearly present in his submissions, I believe that the dismissal component of Prothonotary Tabib's order was appropriate."], ["[45]", "Even if I were to consider the matter", "de novo", ", I would come to the same conclusion. What is at stake here is the integrity of the Rules and that of the Court's process. Having failed to file his application record in accordance with Prothonotary Tabib's order, and resorting to status review - being an abuse of process in the circumstances of this case - it can reasonably be said that it is not possible to continue the proceedings as per Rule 168 and that the Applicant's underlying judicial review application is therefore open to dismissal."], ["[46]", "What might, on its face, appear to be a drastic measure has to be put in proper perspective. As I have already indicated, the Applicant has no personal interest in the outcome of the present proceedings which he pursues strictly on moral grounds solely for the advancement of the jurisprudence in the public interest. The civil justice system discharges state functions and constitutes a public service (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). However, its resources, like any other parts of the public service, are limited and need to be rationed among competing claimants (", "Borowski Canada (Attorney General)", ", [1989] 1 SCR 342, at para 34).

The Retaliation Argument"], ["[47]", "The Applicant claims that tensions arose with Prothonotary Tabib in file T-550-13 and that the Order is a form of reprisal against him. In other words, he claims that she was biased and even urges the Court to presume bad faith on the part of Prothonotary Tabib."], ["[48]", "Those are very serious allegations which the Applicant has failed to establish to any appreciable degree. As the Respondent points out, the Applicant has been cautioned not to make unfounded allegations against members of the Court. In its decision dated November 13, 2014 affirming the order of Justice Roy referred to above, the Federal Court of Appeal went as far as to warn the Applicant that unsubstantiated allegations of bias \"expose him to the dismissal of his proceedings as an abuse of process, either at the request of the opposing party or on the Court's own motion\", and directed him to \"govern himself accordingly\" (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[49]", "The Court of Appeal in that case explained, in the following terms, why unsupported allegations of improper judicial conduct constituted an abuse of process:"], ["[12] Allegations of judicial bias cannot be allowed to go unchallenged as they attack one of the pillars of the judicial system, namely the principle that judges are impartial as between the parties who appear before them. The failure to challenge and denounce such allegations may be seen in certain circles as an implicit admission of their truth. This in turn encourages others to make them until they become common currency among those who have a limited perspective on the judicial system. The result is a loss of confidence in the judicial system in some quarters, an issue which must be taken seriously in a society committed to the rule of law."], ["[13] In", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, this Court characterized repeated allegations of bias as attacks on the \"integrity of the entire administration of justice.\" In", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, Sharlow J.A. stated that unsupported allegations of improper conduct constituted an abuse of process.

Persons who invoke the court's assistance in its capacity as an independent arbiter of disputes and who then repeatedly allege bias when the court's decisions do not meet their expectations are not using the judicial system in good faith. The Court is entitled to decline to lend its assistance to such litigants."], ["[50]", "Clearly, the message of the Federal Court of Appeal has not been heard by the Applicant. By making unsupported allegations of improper conduct against Prothonotary Tabib, he is again attacking the integrity of the adjudicative function of the courts.

This power includes the authority to award costs against a successful party (Rule 400(6)). On motions for extension of time, the rule applicable to the assessment of costs by assessment officers is that the costs shall be borne by the party seeking the extension unless the Court orders otherwise (Rule 410(2))."], ["[53]", "Here, even assuming that the Applicant can be characterized as the \"successful party\" on his Rules 8 and 55 motion, the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED", ", above, is, in my view, dispositive of this issue.

The motions judge relied on Rule 410(2) which provides that, unless otherwise ordered, the costs of a motion for an extension of time shall be borne by the party seeking the extension. Mr. Abi-Mansour points to a number of cases where no such order was made. This does not assist Mr. Abi-Mansour as each case represents an exercise of judicial discretion based on the circumstances of the particular case. Mr. Abi-Mansour was the party seeking the extension of time and was therefore,", "prima facie", ", within the scope of Rule 410(2). The motions judge saw no reason to depart from the award of costs contemplated by the Rule.

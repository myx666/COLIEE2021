She arrived in Canada as a minor in 1969. The applicant's family in Canada consists of her mother, two sisters, one daughter, two granddaughters and one great-granddaughter.

Her new husband wrongly advised her that she no longer needed to pursue her permanent residence application because, as the wife of a Canadian citizen, she automatically obtained status. The applicant therefore did not pursue her immigration application further."], ["[6]", "The applicant has been charged with various crimes in Canada. In July 1971, she was charged with theft under $5,000. Later, in September 1997, she was charged with theft over $5,000 and personation with intent. In February 2004, she was charged with several offences including personation with intent, possession of property obtained by crime, fraud over $5,000, fraud under $5,000, false pretence and failure to appear in Court. For these 2004 offences, the applicant was sentenced to 245 days incarceration and three years probation. At that time, the applicant was also approached by an immigration officer who recommended that she obtain a temporary resident permit. The applicant obtained a temporary resident permit in December 2006. It expired in December 2007 and the applicant did not renew it."], ["[7]", "In August 2008, the applicant was charged for driving while impaired.

On June 27, 2011, a subsection 44(1) inadmissibility report was issued against the applicant. This report first summarized the applicant's immigration background and criminal history in Canada. It noted that the applicant is collecting a \"widow's pension\" from CN Rail and appears well established in her community. The report also remarked that consideration can be given to the length of time that the applicant had lived in Canada and the establishment of her and her family. However, due to her criminal convictions and as the applicant had not sought to renew her immigration status after she discovered it was lacking and her temporary permit expired, the officer recommended a removal order be issued.

Her mother currently lives in a seniors' residence that does not provide assisted living services, hence, the applicant is her primary caregiver.

She was then handcuffed and brought to the CBSA office."], ["[15]", "At the CBSA office, the applicant was photographed and her fingerprints were taken. She declined counsel and declined notification to the Australian consulate. The delegate then interviewed the applicant.

The applicant submits that in determining whether a person should be removed, relevant factors include the length of time spent in Canada, the degree of establishment established in Canada and the degree of hardship caused by removal. Relevant factors in the applicant's case included the fact that she entered Canada as a child, the difficulty and hardship she would face in establishing herself in another country, her living and functioning in Canada as a Canadian for over four decades and her support of her dependants in Canada. At a minimum, the delegate should have reviewed these particular circumstances. The delegate erred by not reviewing them or explaining in detail the reasons that led to the decision."], ["[21]", "The applicant also submits that the respondent's delay in pursuing the applicant's case for over seven years renders the deportation order questionable.

On the question of the delegate breaching natural justice, the respondent submits that the courts have the final say on such matters."], ["[23]", "The respondent submits that a foreign national who is inadmissible to Canada for criminality or serious criminality is only entitled to a low level of procedural protection. Further, a delegate's decision to issue a deportation order under subsection 44(2) of the Act is a purely administrative decision that only attracts a minimal duty of fairness. The respondent submits that the duty of fairness in the context of issuing removal orders to foreign nationals is satisfied by the provision of the following participatory rights: the right to a copy of the immigration officer's report; the right to being informed of the allegations, of the case to be met and of the nature and possible consequences of the decision; the right to be interviewed; and the right to present relevant evidence and to express a point of view."], ["[24]", "The respondent submits that the applicant was granted all these rights.

Nevertheless, the respondent notes that when a result is inevitable, an error may not require a decision to be set aside."], ["[26]", "The respondent also submits that subsection 228(a) of the Regulations clearly states that a delegate does not have the discretion to refer the report to the Immigration Division. This provision states that if a report in respect of a foreign national does not include any grounds of inadmissibility other than serious criminality or criminality under paragraphs 36(1)(a) or 36(2)(a) of the Act, the report shall not be referred to the Immigration Division. Rather, the delegate shall issue a deportation order. In this case, the delegate properly followed the procedure set out in the Regulations. As there was no discretion to refer the 44(1) report to the Immigration Division, there was no breach of procedural fairness in the delegate not doing so."], ["[27]", "The respondent also submits that the H&C factors are not relevant. It is established jurisprudence that a delegate acting under subsection 44(2) of the Act is simply on a fact finding mission. H&C factors have no place in this decision, where the sole focus is on whether the information on the applicant's inadmissibility is accurate."], ["[28]", "Finally, the respondent submits that the seven year delay in issuing the deportation order is not a serious deficiency that warrants referral to the Immigration Division. A delay in itself is not an abuse of process that gives rise to a remedy. Rather, a delay may be considered an abuse of process where that passage of time prejudices an applicant's ability to defend him or herself.

Once an inadmissibility report has been prepared and found to be well founded, the Minister has the discretion to refer the report to the Immigration Division.

A Minister's decision to refer the report to the Immigration Division as opposed to issuing a removal order is essentially a determination of the scope of its discretion.

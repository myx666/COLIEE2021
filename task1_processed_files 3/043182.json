The delegate ruled that he had jurisdiction to hear a preliminary motion by the trustees, on the one hand, to have the statutory provisions declared inoperative in their regard on the ground that they contain no structural guarantee that they will be given a hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal and, on the other hand, to obtain an order to stay the proceedings in their regard on the ground that the implementation of these provisions is no greater guarantee to them of a hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal.

The first concerns the principle of the supremacy of the Constitution (pp. 528-29):", "\"First, and most importantly, the Constitution is, under s. 52(1) of the", "Constitution Act, 1982", ", 'the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect'. The invalidity of a legislative provision inconsistent with the", "Charter", "does not arise from the fact of its being declared unconstitutional by a court, but from the operation of s. 52(1). Thus, in principle, such a provision is invalid from the moment it is enacted, and a judicial declaration to this effect is but one remedy amongst others to protect those whom it adversely affects. In that sense, by virtue of s. 52(1), the question of constitutional validity inheres in every legislative enactment. Courts may not apply invalid laws, and the same obligation applies to every level and branch of government, including the administrative organs of the state. Obviously, it cannot be the case that every government official has to consider and decide for herself the constitutional validity of every provision she is called upon to apply.", "If, however, she is endowed with the power to consider questions of law relating to a provision, that power will normally extend to assessing the constitutional validity of that provision", ". This is because the consistency of a provision with the Constitution is a question of law arising under that provision. It is, indeed, the most fundamental question of law one could conceive, as it will determine whether the enactment is in fact valid law, and thus whether it ought to be interpreted and applied as such or disregarded.", "From this principle of constitutional supremacy also flows, as a practical corollary, the idea that Canadians should be entitled to assert the rights and freedoms that the Constitution guarantees them in the most accessible forum available, without the need for parallel proceedings before the courts", ": see", "Douglas College", ", supra, at pp. 603-4. In La Forest, J.'s, words, 'there cannot be a Constitution for arbitrators and another for the courts' (", "Douglas College", ", supra, at p. 597). This accessibility concern is particularly pressing given that many administrative tribunals have exclusive initial jurisdiction over disputes relating to their enabling legislation, so that forcing litigants to refer", "Charter", "issues to the courts would result in costly and time-consuming bifurcation of proceedings. As McLachlin, J. (as she then was), stated in her dissent in", "Cooper", ", supra, at para. 70:", "The", "Charter", "is not some holy grail which only judicial initiates of the superior courts may touch", ". The", "Charter", "belongs to the people. All law and law-makers that touch the people must conform to it. Tribunals and commissions charged with deciding legal issues are no exception.

A determination by a tribunal that a provision of its enabling statute is invalid pursuant to the", "Charter", "is not binding on future decision makers, within or outside the tribunal's administrative scheme", ". Only by obtaining a formal declaration of invalidity by a court can a litigant establish the general invalidity of a legislative provision for all future cases. Therefore, allowing administrative tribunals to decide", "Charter", "issues does not undermine the role of the courts as final arbiters of constitutionality in Canada.\" (Emphasis added)"], ["[12]", "Once he had set out the above principles, Gonthier, J., in", "Martin", ", went on to say that \"[t]hus, as a rule, 'an administrative tribunal which has been conferred the power to interpret law holds a concomitant power to determine whether that law is constitutionally valid'. ... If a tribunal does have the power to consider questions of law, then it follows by the operation of s. 52(1) [of the", "Constitution Act, 1982", "] that it must be able to address constitutional issues, including the constitutional validity of its enabling statute.\" In passing, I note here that, as a quasi-constitutional instrument, the", "Canadian Bill of Rights", ", S.C. 1960, c. 44, reproduced in R.S.C. 1985, Appendix III (the", "Bill of Rights", ") remains in full force and effect (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 422; 14 C.R.R. 13; 12 Admin. L.R. 137, at p. 224 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at pages 875-79  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In this regard, s. 2 of the", "Bill of Rights", "provides that \"[e]very law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the", "Canadian Bill of Rights", "be so construed and applied", "as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared ...\".

In that case the Supreme Court of Canada held unanimously that the Forest Appeals Commission (the Commission), a provincial administrative agency, could determine incidentally a question of aboriginal rights falling within federal statutory jurisdiction. The Court held that while there are distinctions between administrative tribunals and courts, both are part of the justice system. Viewed properly, then, the justice system encompasses the ordinary courts, federal courts, statutory provincial courts and administrative tribunals. In short, in applying their enabling legislation, administrative agencies must take into account all applicable legal rules, both federal and provincial. But the power to decide a question of law is the power to decide by applying only", "valid", "laws. The law in question in", "Paul", ", supra, the", "Forest Practices Code of British Columbia", ", R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 159. allowed a party to \"make submissions as to facts, law and jurisdiction\". The existence of the latter provision, conjoined with the fact that the Commission's decision could be appealed on a question of law or jurisdiction, made it impossible to sustain the argument that the Commission, an adjudicative body, determined purely factual matters."], ["[14]", "On the other hand, the complexity of the question to be determined is not an obstacle once it has been established that the administrative tribunal is empowered to decide questions of law.

This being the case, unlike the judgments of a court, the decisions of an administrative tribunal on constitutional questions do not create any precedents and could not be declaratory of the validity of any law. Furthermore, the rulings would be reviewable, on a correctness basis, in a superior court on judicial review (", "Paul", ", supra, at paras. 22, 23, 33 and 39). In the instant case, in the context of reviewing the tribunal's second decision, the Court may conduct a full review of the institution responsible for punishing the derogatory conduct of the trustees in bankruptcy, from the standpoint of both administrative law arguments and constitutional law arguments raised by the trustees (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at paras. 7, 10, 11, 21, 31 and 45)."], ["[15]", "Be that as it may, in this case the Attorney General of Canada argues that the tribunal - whether the Superintendent himself or the delegate he designates - has no jurisdiction to decide constitutional questions on the basis of the decisions delivered by this Court in 1995 and 1996 in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra.

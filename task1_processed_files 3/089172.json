His wife, a son, and a daughter, continue to reside in Bulgaria.", ". . . . .", "SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMANT'S ALLEGATIONS", "The claimant was born in Haskovo, Bulgaria, in 1948. He attended school for 11 years and trained to work as a machinist.", "The claimant alleges he is of gypsy (Roma) ethnicity. While he was growing up, he experienced continuing discrimination and harassment by reason of his Roma origins. During his compulsory military service over the years 1967 to 1969, he alleged that all the dirty and difficult jobs were given to him and not to ethnic Bulgarians. The same problems confronted him in the area of employment where he felt that difficult, dirty, short-duration jobs were given to him and to other Romas in contrast to what was available for ethnic Bulgarians. For 20 years the claimant worked in construction and as a cleaner, experiencing constant layoffs and job relocations.", "In the winter of 1989, he and his family were evicted from their housing in Sofia and literally turned out into the street. They spent the next several years living in a wooden shack and not until March 1993 was the family able to secure reasonable accommodation in a proper apartment building. However, from the moment they moved in, they faced resentment and hostility from their neighbours because of their Roma ethnicity. Less than a year after occupying their new apartment, they found themselves served with an eviction notice. The claimant and his family decided to resist the order. Neighbours set woodwork in the building on fire and accused the claimant's family (in particular, the claimant's mother) of responsibility. Then his mother was reported to the authorities as senile and forcibly removed to a mental hospital where she was poorly treated and became ill. The claimant wrote to health authorities protesting his mother's situation and in consequence, the police began persecuting him. He was denied access to his mother as she was dying. The claimant wrote a complaint to the Minister of Health. After that action, police came to the claimant's home, searched it and arrested him. He was kept in police custody for two nights. beaten, and made to tear up his complaint before he was released.", "The claimant turned to a Roma political party for assistance but he found the party powerless to assist him. In the winter of 1994/95 the claimant hid out in the village of Turnovo while he was working in the same area. However, the police discovered his whereabouts and, while he was at work on a building site, seized him and forced him into a car destined for Sofia. En route, his abductors struck him repeatedly, saying they would 'knock some reason into his head.' On arrival in Sofia, he was taken before a prosecutor who asked him to sign a statement saying that he was voluntarily relinquishing his apartment. He was told that if he cooperated, another apartment would be found for him and his family. But if he resisted, he and his family would be forcibly evicted. The claimant said he would not sign the statement before having a chance to discuss the matter with his family. At this, the prosecutor became infuriated and started to strike the claimant. Then he took out an arrest warrant and served it on the claimant. The claimant was taken to the cell where he was told to 'think things over.' During the night, he was taken to another cell occupied by three other men. In the morning the three men were released but the claimant was kept inside. The prosecutor visited him to inquire whether he had 'changed his mind.' The prosecutor made numerous threats against the claimant and released the claimant after making him sign a blank summons mandating a court appearance in June or July 1995.", "As the claimant was leaving the building where he had been held, 4 men jumped him and forced him into car. The claimant was driven to a site outside Sofia. He recognized three of the men as his former cellmates. They had in their possession the declaration, which the claimant had been earlier told to sign by the prosecutor. The claimant was held for three days and three nights, beaten and threatened. On the third night he managed to bribe the fourth man (then the sole guard) and escape.", "The claimant immediately telephoned his wife who informed him that his construction work brigade was soon leaving for an assignment in Russia, in the city of Samara. The claimant arranged to go there as well, and on August 12, 1995, he traveled to Samara. However, police learned where he was and had his company return him to Bulgaria. Once back in Sofia, the police renewed their efforts to force the claimant and his family to vacate their apartment. To achieve this, the claimant was continually made to attend at the police station and other family members were subjected to constant harassment.", "Just before Easter, in April 1996, police raided the claimant's apartment when he was temporarily absent. They searched everywhere, leaving his family in a state of shock. They then produced a 'protocol' for the search and compelled claimant's wife to sign it. They also advised the claimant's wife that if she wished to continue living, she would be well advised to leave the claimant.", "Shortly after this episode, the claimant was arrested again and taken to the police station where he was told to sign a statement voluntarily giving up his apartment. He refused to comply. He was again sent to a cell where he was held overnight. The following day, renewed efforts were made to have him sign a statement but he refused to do so. He was finally released after a summons was issued for him and his family.", "The claimant sought the assistance of a lawyer but initially could find no one who would take on his case because he was a gypsy. He also turned for assistance to a Roma Parliamentary Representative named Manush Romanov. After discussing his problems in detail with Mr. Romanov, the claimant concluded that while Mr. Romanov might be able to assist him in securing another apartment, he was impotent to redress the wrongs the claimant had already suffered and he could not resolve the claimant's larger fears and insecurities.", "The claimant decided that he had to leave the country to safeguard his safety and security. He intended to go to Canada to seek asylum but there was no resident Canadian Embassy in Sofia and he felt it would be difficult to obtain a Canadian visa. He decided to go to the USA and he received an American visa in Sofia on August 7, 1996.", "The claimant entered the USA and traveled to Las Vegas where he lived and worked until December 1996. He did not apply for asylum in the USA but instead, traveled north, with several other Bulgarian nationals, arriving at Douglas, B.C., and entering Canada on December 6, 1996. He claimed refugee status on arrival.\""], ["[3]", "The tribunal concluded that the applicant was unlikely to be Roma.

For example, when discussing the applicant's ethnicity, the tribunal stated at page 6 that it \"finds the history of persecution provided by the claimant not to be credible and thus it is difficult to approach his claimed ethnicity without substantial skepticism.\" When discussing the applicant's failure to claim for Convention refugee status in the United States, the tribunal stated at page 15 that \"the panel finds the claimant's explanation for his sojourn in United States not credible\", adding at page 16 that \"when his delay in claiming is coupled to the other elements in his story that are also strongly wanting in credibility, a picture emerges of an opportunistic and untrustworthy witness.\""], ["[5]", "Questions of credibility are within the jurisdiction of the tribunal as the trier of fact in respect of Convention refugee claims, and a reviewing court should be hesitant in interfering.

Additionally, the tribunal often substitutes its own version of events without evidence to support its conclusions."], ["[7]", "A tribunal may make adverse findings of credibility based on the implausibility of an applicant's story provided the inferences drawn can be reasonably said to exist. However, plausibility findings should be made only in the clearest of cases, i.e., if the facts as presented are outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected, or where the documentary evidence demonstrates that the events could not have happened in the manner asserted by the claimant. A tribunal must be careful when rendering a decision based on a lack of plausibility because refugee claimants come from diverse cultures, and actions which appear implausible when judged from Canadian standards might be plausible when considered from within the claimant's milieu.

The appropriateness of a particular finding can therefore only be assessed if the Board's decision clearly identifies all of the facts which form the basis for their conclusions. The Board will therefore err when it fails to refer to relevant evidence which could potentially refute their conclusions of implausibility", "...\" (emphasis added)"], ["[9]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at 314, Mr. Justice Cullen quashed a decision of the tribunal after concluding that it erred because its plausibility findings were made without referring to the documentary evidence, and because they were made based on Canadian paradigms:", "\"[4] ...", "However, in making a finding of what was plausible or implausible the Refugee Division made no reference to the documentary evidence filed in support of the applicant, namely the Amnesty International reports.", "According to the reports, the events described by the applicant were not an unusual occurrence and constant harassment of members or former members of Akali Dal was the norm, not the exception. Therefore, in my view, the failure to comment on the evidence filed, either in a negative or positive manner, seriously weakened the Refugee Division's decision and conclusions. Further, the applicant's contention is wholly consistent with the documentary evidence filed and is probably the only source of evidence sustaining the applicant's case; or is the only clue to determining if the applicant's evidence is plausible. This documentary evidence was the only gauge available regarding the conduct of authorities in Indian vis-à-vis Sikhs and the reports referred to these occurrences as \"routine\".", "\"[5]", "Moreover, the events as described by the applicant may have seemed implausible and therefore not credible to the Refugee Division, but as counsel for the applicant points out 'Canadian paradigms do not apply in India'.", "Torture, unhappily, is real, as is exploitation and revenge, often resulting in killings.\" (emphasis added)"], ["[10]", "The applicant alleged that the Bulgarian police and civic officials were trying to evict him and his family from their apartment in Sofia because they were Roma.

The applicant testified that in the attempt to evict him, his mother was improperly incarcerated in a mental asylum where she died, and that he was abducted, savagely beaten, jailed without legal authority, and pulled back from a work assignment abroad in Russia. Further, he stated that his apartment was rigorously searched, and that his family were repeatedly interrogated while his lawyer's efforts to secure justice were brushed aside.

The only papers he possessed consisted of copies of his own correspondence.", "When he was asked why the Bulgarian authorities would go to such lengths to create an appearance of legality around efforts to evict him, he said that if they did not proceed cautiously in their eviction, they might find themselves 'facing a Roma revolt.' He added that he was in touch with a Roma MP named Manush Romanov and had taken steps to retain a lawyer. These comments, implying as they do that the Bulgarian government was nervous about antagonizing the Roma community are completely at odds with a multitude of other statements made by the claimant indicating the Bulgarian state was completely indifferent to the situation of the Roma community and cared not a fig for its general welfare. As well the observation, if ingested at face value, borders on the inherently absurd - if the Bulgarian State wished to appear scrupulously 'legal' about an eviction order for fear of Roma anger, why would the same state abduct and brutalize the claimant and his family? Does a 'legal' eviction make for better political 'optics' than kidnapping, terror, and physical brutality?\" (emphasis added)"], ["[13]", "Throughout this decision, the tribunal asks the applicant to explain the actions of the authorities, and then categorically rejects his answers.

The tribunal itself reviewed the entrenched discrimination and persecution against the Roma in Bulgaria starting at page 16 of the decision, yet rejected the applicant's explanation that he was being pressured to sign a document which would force him from his apartment because he was Roma. One cannot understand how the tribunal expects the applicant to explain logically the illogical actions of the authorities.

Why would anyone risk their [sic]own life [sic] or their neighbours' lives in such a mad endeavour?", "Why would they need to, if prejudice against a Roma family, in the complex was so strong that eviction could move forward on that basis alone?", "Further, it seems probable to the panel that intemperate (possibly defamatory) accusations by the claimant concerning his mother's hospitalization and death, expressed in strongly-worded letters to Ministers, set the stage for further conflicts with neighbours and civic officials.", "\" (emphasis added)"], ["[15]", "There are three problems with this passage.

Secondly, the tribunal finds that the applicant's story is implausible when it states, without evidence, that it cannot believe that a neighbour would deliberately start a blaze wrongly to blame the applicant's mother. Finally, the tribunal wrongly blames the applicant for his predicament because, in its opinion, his complaints to the authorities regarding his mother's treatment were intemperate and defamatory, and set the stage for further conflict.

In discussing the risk to the applicant based on his appearance, the tribunal stated at page 7:", "The panel asked the claimant whether his physical appearance would enable other Bulgarians to conclude he was Roma were he to appear on a street in Sofia.", "He said that other Bulgarians would know he was Roma because of his 'bright picturesque clothing' but he later acknowledged that if he wore regular clothing it would be difficult to say he was Roma.\" (emphasis added)"], ["[40]", "And at page 8:", "\"The panel concludes that", "the claimant would not be perceived to be Roma by fellow Bulgarians who possessed no specific knowledge of his alleged family antecedents.", "If he is indeed Roma, he is also very assimilated or, in his own words, 'one of those Roma who are considered to be Bulgarian.'\" (emphasis added)"], ["[41]", "And at page 17:", "\"In the claimant's case, if he is indeed Roma through genetic inheritance, he has effectively transcended the Roma identity visibly, socially, and economically.", "Of course, someone somehow discovering his Roma ancestry might still seek to injure him.", "However, in a large center like Sofia it is safe to say that someone with the claimant's attributes and background would blend seamlessly into the Bulgarian majority. His risk of persecution is therefore effectively at the level of 'mere possibility'. (emphasis added)"], ["[42]", "The tribunal's analysis that the applicant is safe because other Bulgarians would not recognize him as being Roma is incomplete. In this instance, it was the authorities which were the source of the applicant's problems. That they have already determined that he is Roma belies the tribunal's assumption that his risk is a mere possibility. That they already know that he is a Roma would have been sufficient reason for the tribunal to consider his risk at their authoritarian hands as well as at the hands of other Bulgarians.", "Summary: Ethnicity"], ["[43]", "This Court finds that the tribunal's omission of documents which were favourable to the applicant, without adequate explanation, to have been patently unreasonable. Further, the tribunal simply and overtly speculated when it analyzed the applicant's baptismal certificate.

Delay in Claiming"], ["[44]", "The tribunal did not believe the applicant's explanation for his seven week delay in the United States. It states at page 16", "The panel finds the claimant's explanation for his sojourn in United States not credible", ". He alleged in his PIF that he went to United States, though always intending to go to Canada for asylum, solely because there is no Canadian Embassy in Sofia and he could not obtain a Canadian visitor visa there. In his oral testimony, by contrast, he said that he went United States because he had contacts in the construction field, who were able to secure an American visa for a fee of $2,500. His direct flight to the USA, terminating in Las Vegas, indicates that he already had employment arranged in United States to which he was destined.", "If fearful of persecution, why then did he fail to apply for asylum in the United States? The claimant's response to this question was fuzzy and unclear.", "He suggested that he placed more confidence in Canada's refugee system and in the level of social tolerance in Canada than he did in the USA. Those comments may be truthful in the narrow sense that they were made but, equally, they are not redolent of the behaviour of a person acting under a genuine and driving fear of persecution.\" (emphasis added)"], ["[45]", "In reviewing the transcript of the proceedings, this Court finds that there was nothing fuzzy or unclear in the applicant's response on page 23: he stated that he is convinced that Canada accepts refugees more easily. Moreover, there is nothing implausible about the applicant's obtaining a job in the United States to pay for his visa to come to Canada. Finally, to characterize a seven-week delay as painting a picture \"of an opportunistic and untrustworthy witness\" again implies dishonesty on the part of the applicant, and amounts in the circumstances, to speculation made of whole cloth by the tribunal."], ["[46]", "On page 16, the tribunal once again attempts to explain the actions of the applicant without evidence:", "\"The panel believes that the claimant went to the United States", "intending to live and work there illegally", "for reasons not attached to fear but of economic advancement.

The tribunal once again speculates without evidence by stating that the applicant intended to live and work illegally in the United States. Moreover, the tribunal's statement that the applicant \"doubtless heard\" about the movement of Czech Roma to Canada is difficult to accept given that the applicant is Bulgarian, not Czech, and that there was absolutely no evidence before the tribunal which would allow such an inference. In the absence of evidence, to characterize the applicant as opportunistic and untrustworthy was patently unreasonable. Seven weeks was a not unreasonable time within which to get the applicant's bearings in a strange country, on first impression, where he did not know the language. Some claimants might have taken less time, but this applicant is not \"some claimants\"; he is an individual whom the tribunal did not sufficiently particularize.", "7. Reasonable Apprehension of Bias"], ["[48]", "The applicant urged this Court to hold that the tribunal demonstrated a reasonable apprehension of bias when it described his demeanour while testifying. Although one cannot agree with the assertion that a negative description of an applicant's demeanour, per se, constitutes a reasonable apprehension of bias, this Court infers that in this instance it is merely one aspect of a pattern which raises the Court's reasonable apprehension of the tribunal's probable bias against this applicant."], ["[49]", "The test for a reasonable apprehension of bias is whether an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, and having thought the matter through would conclude that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the tribunal members (see", "Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It is not difficult to conclude that the test has been met here. The following factors were significant in coming to this conclusion:", "a. The tribunal's findings of implausibility regarding the pressure faced by the applicant to sign a release form;", "b. The tribunal's findings of implausibility regarding the searches of the applicant's home;", "c. The tribunal's findings of implausibility regarding how the fire started near the applicant's home;", "d. The tribunal's findings of implausibility regarding the interrogation of his children;", "e.

The tribunal's steadfast refusal to accept the applicant's testimony, combined with its errors in reviewing the documentary evidence which appeared to favour the applicant, and its insistence on substituting its own version of events without evidence lead to the conclusion that the applicant did not have a fair chance to obtain Convention refugee status.", "8.

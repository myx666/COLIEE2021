He candidly stated that he could not recall what Mr. Wygant's job title had been. No position description for Mr. Wygant was produced. The evidence did not establish whether a position description had ever been developed or not. While a position description is not necessarily determinative of a person's job title, duties, office, function, set or bundle of tasks, the failure to establish Mr. Wygant's job title gives rise to the inference of a fundamental lack of information on the part of the witnesses as to what Mr. Wygant did.\" [see footnote 6]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The letter terminating the respondent's employment, dated the 18th of November, 1998, read in part as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"As you have been informed, Regional Cablesystems Inc. has acquired all of the shares in Northern Cable Holdings Limited and they were amalgamated together with Sudbury Cable Services Limited, and continued as Regional Cablesystems Inc. ... effective November 1, 1998.

Laskin, C.J., states, ...:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "'... if such a tribunal has acted beyond its jurisdiction in making a decision, it is", "not a decision at all", "within the meaning of the statute which defines its powers because Parliament could not have intended to clothe such tribunal with the power to expand its statutory jurisdiction by an erroneous decision as to the scope of its own powers.' [Emphasis added]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Given that a decision of an administrative tribunal in excess of its jurisdiction 'is not a decision at all', it seems paradoxical that the same 'decision' would be immunized from review where jurisdiction is never raised and the tribunal's jurisdiction and/or the constitutionality of its enabling legislation is assumed. This is tantamount to saying that parties to an administrative proceeding may, by waiver or acquiesence [acquiescence], confer jurisdiction on a tribunal that was not, or could not be, conferred by Parliament, and that this conferral of authority by the parties is unreviewable once the decision is made. Indeed, it is not difficult to imagine a tribunal falling into jurisdictional error simply because it did not hear arguments on that issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Viewed in this light, the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Poirier", "and", "Sirois", "are distinguishable from the case at bar because of the jurisdictional nature of the new arguments being raised here. The Alberta Court of Appeal and Ontario High Court have considered this issue and held that a reviewing court may consider a challenge to a tribunal's jurisdiction that was never raised before the tribunal itself ...

She noted that though a position description was not necessarily determinative of the respondent's duty, office, function, set or bundle of tasks, the failure to establish his job title gave rise \"... to the inference of a fundamental lack of information on the part of the witnesses ...\" as to what the respondent did in the last position that he held before his employment was terminated. I am satisfied that the same failure must logically give rise to an inference of a fundamental lack of information on the part of the witnesses who appeared before the Adjudicator as to whether the respondent was a manager.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "In a letter dated the 21st of January, 1999 from solicitors for the applicant to the solicitors for the respondent, the following sentence appears:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"You have suggested that his [the respondent's] position was upper or senior management. I am advised that in the industry, [the respondent's] position would not be considered to be part of the main stream management at all. He apparently was in a senior salesman position with some supervisory responsibility, with respect to an adjunct to the core cable business, that being the operation of an 'ad channel'. While the person in that position had an important role to play with respect to that one aspect of the business, that area was not a significant part of the core operation ... Accordingly, [the applicant] disagrees with the suggestion that he was part of the upper or senior management.\" [see footnote 13]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "It is interesting to note that this communication appeared to respond to an allegation on behalf of the respondent that his position was upper or senior management.

However, even if the presumption was applicable, the failure to call Ms. Iles to testify as to the creation date indicates as the most natural inference, that the appellants were afraid to call her and this fear is some evidence that if she were called, she would have exposed facts unfavourable to the appellants. In drawing an adverse inference, the learned Trial Judge relied on the following passage from", "Wigmore on Evidence", "which is relevant to the issue:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "'The failure to bring before the tribunal some circumstance, document or witness, when either the party himself or his opponent claims that the facts would thereby be elucidated, serves to indicate, as the most natural inference, that the party fears to do so; and this fear is some evidence that the circumstances or document or witness, if brought, would have exposed facts unfavourable to the party. These inferences, to be sure, cannot fairly be made except upon certain conditions; and they are also open always to explanation by circumstances which make some other hypothesis a more natural one than the parties' fear of exposure.

The respondent was remarkably successful before the Adjudicator. Thus, when the issue of managerial status arose for the first time before this Court, the respondent had nothing to gain by speaking to his status at the time of termination of his employment and, perhaps, much to lose in terms of self image and reputation. He was under no obligation to make out the applicant's case for it. Neither was he under any obligation to put himself through the further discomfort of cross-examination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "I draw no adverse inference from the failure on the part of the respondent to file an affidavit before this Court attesting as to his bundle of duties and responsibilities at the time his employment was terminated.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "vi) The new evidence filed on behalf of the applicant before this Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [13]:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"...

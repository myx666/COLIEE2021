Even if he was allowed in England, he believed he might be deported from there. He fears he would come under suspicion for any actions taking place in the United Kingdom because of his background and would probably still get some pressure from the police to provide cooperation. He did not know how he stood with the police in England, or whether they would let him in or just tell him to go back to Ireland.", "(d) As to Europe, he was not familiar with the rules but believed he would be considered undesirable because of his past association with paramilitary groups in Ireland.

First, the applicant recounts an occasion in July 1999 when youth members of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) confronted the applicant and other MDC members at a bus terminal and began threatening and harassing them. The altercation was violent. The ZANU-PF members drew weapons and beat the applicant and his companions. The applicant states he was seriously injured in the attack, receiving a cracked jaw and requiring dental surgery. The applicant states that while he reported this event to the police, it was never seriously investigated and the perpetrators were never caught."], ["[4]", "The second incident raised by the applicant occurred in April 1999, when he was confronted and arrested by state security agents. According to the applicant, the security agents threatened to torture or kill him if he did not provide them with information about the MDC and its activities.

Specifically, the applicant stated at the port of entry that he was detained by security agents in approximately 1995, while his PIF narrative stated that the detention occurred in April 1999. Further, while the port of entry declaration stated the applicant was assaulted at work, his PIF narrative states that he was assaulted at a bus terminal.

While the Court accepts that the applicant was employed by a company engaged in commuter and tourism transportation, the applicant's testimony before the Board clearly establishes that the attack occurred while he was waiting at the bus terminal with friends and relatives. There is a clear inconsistency between the applicant's statement at the port of entry and that which was given before the Board. Accordingly, the Board was justified in reaching a negative credibility inference on this basis."], ["[12]", "Further, the Court also does not accept the applicant's submission that the Board failed to provide reasons for rejecting his explanation that he was unsure of the exact date he was arrested.

Accordingly, the Board's finding was justified on the evidence.", "Applicant's account of events and corroborating evidence"], ["[13]", "In its decision, the Board drew a negative inference from the applicant's vague testimony surrounding the two incidents of harassment in Zimbabwe.

If the events did occur in that order, he did not follow the instructions to list the events in chronological order in his PIF. His PIF gives the impression the assault occurred before the detention. He sent in a revised PIF narrative and instead of clarifying the dates added \"approximately\" before April 1999, thereby further obfuscating the dates in his allegations. ... At least three letters of support, including one from his mother, make reference to the assault with a \"knuckle-duster\" and yet none of them mention a date of occurrence. The medical note attesting to his injuries in July 1999 is also undated. For these reasons I find his documentary evidence and oral testimony unreliable and I am not persuaded his allegations are credible."], ["[14]", "The applicant challenges this finding on a number of fronts. First, he states the PIF amendment was not an attempt to obfuscate the dates, but was merely a clarification to reflect the fact that the applicant is not particularly good with dates. Second, the applicant states that the Board applied a \"specious test for credibility\" and rejected his submissions merely because they were not listed in chronological order. Finally, he argues that the Board was dismissive of his corroborating evidence simply because the medical report was not dated."], ["[15]", "However, the Court concludes that when taken as a whole, the applicant's testimony and evidence creates serious concerns over when the alleged events occurred.

However, the respondent notes that the Board's decision was not premised on the existence of exit controls, but on the applicant's own testimony that security agents continued to monitor his whereabouts from April 1999 until he left the country.

Further, it is clear that even if the Board had accepted the applicant's testimony that he was involved in the MDC prior to its official formation, there are sufficient other findings upon which the Board's negative decision can properly rest.

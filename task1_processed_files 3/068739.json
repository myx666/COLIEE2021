The applicant was allegedly told by the agent that it would be easier to get to Singapore and then to Malaysia from Sri Lanka than from India.

Those submissions in turn argue simply that in the particular circumstances of this case, the failure of the decision-maker to disclose ahead of the decision the UK OGN of July 2013 was a breach of the duty of fairness.

First, an applicant is deemed to know from his past experience with the refugee process what type of evidence of general country conditions the immigration officer will be relying on and where to find that evidence; consequently, fairness does not dictate that he be informed of what is available to him in documentation centres. Secondly, where the immigration officer intends to rely on evidence which is not normally found, or was not available at the time the applicant filed his submissions, in documentation centres, fairness dictates that the applicant be informed of any novel and significant information which evidences a change in the general country conditions that may affect the disposition of the case. (Para 22)", "The Court concludes:", "The fact that a document becomes available after the filing of an applicant's submissions by no means signifies that it contains new information or that such information is relevant information that will affect the decision. It is only, in my view, where an immigration officer relies on a significant post-submission document which evidences changes in the general country conditions that may affect the decision, that the document must be communicated to that applicant.

Having examined the documents used by the decision-maker, the Court is not of the opinion that they show the kind of changes in the general country conditions that could have affected the decision. They merely reflect continued, but gradual improvements in the conditions in post-civil war Sri Lanka, not unlike the documentation available prior to the applicant's interview and submissions. Accordingly, the lack of disclosure to the applicant does not represent a breach of procedural fairness."], ["[24]", "I find comfort in the decision of this Court in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, where Justice Phelan reached the same conclusion (at para 12).", "B.", "Reasonableness"], ["[25]", "I turn now to the reasonableness of the decision.

A photocopy of the valid card appears at page 55 of the Certified Tribunal Record [CTR]. The record also shows email communication between an official and the UNHCR as to whether the applicant had also submitted an application to the United States (CTR at page 28). Questions were asked of the applicant during his interview with Canadian officials about the status of the discussions with the United States immigration authorities. However, the officer concluded that, notwithstanding the designation, the applicant did not meet the requirements of the IRPA and IRPR on the merits of his application, which are determinative. In the opinion of the Court, the officer's consideration of the applicant's UNHCR designation meets this standard when the reasons as a whole are considered."], ["[29]", "In the case at bar, the applicant acknowledges that the decision-maker was aware of the UNHCR card; he complains about the reasons given which, he argues, do not show that it was considered. However, read as a whole as should be, the decision demonstrates more than awareness of the existence of the UNHCR card. Rather, the reasons show that the decision-maker concluded that the facts and circumstances of the applicant did not qualify him as a refugee. The applicant did not show that he has the profile of someone who would be of interest for the authorities in his home country in the aftermath of the civil war. Five years after the war has ended, the applicant is of little interest, as his ability to come and go would attest. This is not unreasonable as this constitutes an outcome that is acceptable."], ["[30]", "In effect, the officer concluded that the applicant lacked a well-founded fear of persecution, and as such, was not a member of the Convention refugee abroad class.

An applicant with a personal fear of persecution would be unlikely to return to Sri Lanka on the advice of an agent that it was easier to get to Singapore from Sri Lanka than from India. That the applicant traveled under his own name and was neither detained nor harmed during his brief return to the country reasonably supports a finding that the Sri Lankan authorities are not seeking to persecute or harm the applicant."], ["[32]", "This Court has previously found that ease of travel in and out of the country of alleged persecution can undermine a well-founded fear of persecution, especially when the travel occurs using a legitimate passport (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[33]", "The same kind of determination would apply to a determination made about section 147 of the IRPA.

The country conditions will vary over time. Here, it seems that the passage of time has had the effect of bringing a measure of improvement for people of Tamil ethnicity. The applicant's profile does not meet that of those who continue to be of interest for the authorities. In my view that was enough to dispose of the matter.

There will be cases where, in spite of the fact that the reasons for making refugee status have ceased to exist, and thus the person is not a refugee, the treatment suffered alone is sufficient to refuse to return to the country of origin.

Furthermore, such persecution must be appalling in order to rise to \"compelling reasons\". The civil war in Sri Lanka has been a tragedy: the applicant has lost several family members. But there is no evidence on this record that the applicant suffered persecution, torture, or treatment or punishment leading to compelling reasons for refusing to return to his country of origin. He certainly wants to immigrate to Canada. But that is not sufficient to have access to the remedy of subsection 108(4). We do not have that pre-requisite here. The burden was on the applicant to present evidence of persecution to satisfy the test of \"compelling reasons\". It was not discharged."], ["[39]", "Be that as it may, it will suffice in this case to note that in view of the findings made by the officer, which are reasonable, the applicant has not established the compelling reasons referred to in subsection 108(4).

The conditions for the application of the exceptional remedial provision of subsection 108(4) are simply not present."], ["[40]", "Contrary to what is asserted by the applicant, the adequacy of reasons alone is not enough to make a decision unreasonable. Reviewing courts are invited to consider the evidence before the tribunal, as well as the nature of the statutory task, in order to assess the reasons for the decision.

For if it is right that among the reasons for deference are the appointment of the tribunal and not the court as the front line adjudicator, the tribunal's proximity to the dispute, its expertise, etc, then it is also the case that its decision should be presumed to be correct even if its reasons are in some respects defective.

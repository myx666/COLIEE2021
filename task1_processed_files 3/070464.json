With respect to section 97, the Board determined that the applicant \"had been identified", "personally", "as a target\" by the MS (decision at para 34) [emphasis added]; however, despite this finding, the RPD concluded that the risk the applicant faced was a generalized one since gang-related crime is rampant in El Salvador.

The applicant said he had none, and, upon hearing this, one of the MS gang members stabbed the applicant in the arm with a knife. Carlos had a bit of money and gave it to the gang members, who then released the boys. As Carlos and the applicant ran away, the gang members threatened that they were not finished with the applicant and Carlos."], ["[7]", "The applicant and his parents reported the attack to the Salvadoran police, but they did not pursue the issue and, indeed, intimated that they suspected that the applicant was himself an MS member."], ["[8]", "Due to the attack, the applicant dropped out of school and spent his time working on the family's farm, hoping to escape the notice of the MS. A few weeks later, Carlos called the applicant and told him that he had been beaten up by the MS, who were threatening to kill him unless he joined the gang. Shortly thereafter, Carlos' mother came to speak with the applicant to see if he knew where Carlos was since he had been missing for a couple of days and his mother feared he had joined the MS. The applicant was not able to help her as he had not heard from Carlos."], ["[9]", "Two months later, MS gang members again assaulted the applicant and accused him of being the homosexual friend of \"Licho\". The applicant later learned that \"Licho\" was the nickname the MS had given to Carlos. Once again, the applicant and his parents reported the assault to the police, but the police refused to do anything and accused the applicant of being associated with the MS. Approximately two weeks later, members of the gang came to the applicant's home and demanded money, which the applicant's father paid them, as he felt he had no alternative."], ["[10]", "A few months later, Carlos called the applicant, told him that he was now an MS member and demanded that the applicant meet him the following day. The applicant did not show up and Carlos again called him, fuming, and stated that, \"No one makes fun of Licho\". He again demanded a meeting with the applicant, and, once again, the applicant refused to attend. Carlos called the applicant back and told him that he was now an enemy. A few days later, the police came to the applicant's home and questioned and assaulted him, seeking to learn where Carlos was because Carlos had been implicated in the murder of a police officer. The applicant gave the police Carlos' mother's address. The next day, Carlos called the applicant and told him that he was looking forward to killing him as a result of the applicant having spoken to the police."], ["[11]", "The applicant's parents sent him to work and live on another farm, about two hours away, to try to protect him. However, the Salvadoran police pursued him there. The police also went to the applicant's home, questioned his father as to the applicant's whereabouts and assaulted the father. Shortly thereafter, the applicant fled, first to the United States and then, when he was being deported from the U.S., to Canada. The applicant did not make a refugee claim in the United States and alleged that he had received advice from a lawyer to not make such a claim since it was almost certain to fail."], ["[12]", "The applicant's parents make monthly payments to the MS, who continue to make threats against the applicant. The Salvadoran police also continue to question and threaten the applicant's family, and to link the applicant to the MS."], ["[13]", "There was evidence before the Board documenting the extent of MS presence in all parts of El Salvador as well as the existence of a certain degree of corruption within the police force, linking the Salvadoran police to murders and human rights violations.

These centered on discrepancies between the statements the applicant made in his Personal Information Form [PIF] and to the immigration official at the port of entry to Canada regarding the events he claimed took place in El Salvador. The Board concluded on this point that \"... the major inconsistencies and omissions between the [applicant's] statement at the port of entry and his story in his PIF narrative, without a reasonable explanation, undermine the [applicant's] credibility\" (decision at para 17). However, the Board did not base its decision on the applicant's lack of credibility; rather, it went on to analyze his claims on the basis that it had accepted the applicant's version of events."], ["[15]", "With respect to section 96, the RPD held that the determinative issue was the lack of nexus between the harm feared by the applicant and any ground in the Convention refugee definition. The Board relied on several decisions from this Court holding that \"victims of crime, corruption or vendettas generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds\" and concluded that the harm the applicant feared from the MS was not covered by section 96 of IRPA. The RPD also considered the applicant's claim to fear the Salvadoran police, whom the applicant claimed had wrongfully assumed that he was an MS member. The Board concluded that the applicant \"... did not provide any credible evidence to indicate that the police wanted anything other than to interrogate him about any possible connection he had to the [MS], his possible involvement in the police murder and his knowledge of Carlos's involvement in the police murder\" (decision at para 21). The RPD also noted that the applicant had not provided \"any credible evidence\" to suggest that he would not be absolved from suspicion if questioned by the Salvadoran police, and concluded that it was unreasonable for him to fear the police."], ["[16]", "As concerns section 97 of IRPA, as noted, the RPD found that the applicant had \"been identified personally as a target\" by the MS and \"accepted that the [applicant] was subjected personally to a risk to his life\". However, despite these findings, it characterized the risk faced by the applicant as a risk of being recruited to join the MS and of being threatened and assaulted by them. The Board found that such risk is generally faced by all men of the applicant's age in El Salvador. The Board then concluded that protection was not available to the applicant under section 97 of IRPA because that section excludes from the definition of a \"person in need of protection\" those who face risks that would be faced \"generally by other individuals in or from that country\" (IRPA at para 97(1)(b)(ii)).", "III.", "STANDARD OF REVIEW"], ["[17]", "Both parties submitted that the applicable standard of review in respect of each of the alleged errors was reasonableness. I concur that the reasonableness standard applies to the first and second of the alleged errors, namely, the challenge to the Board's credibility findings and to its determinations regarding the treatment the applicant received and would be likely to receive from the Salvadoran police. These are both factual determinations, and it is firmly settled that review of such determinations is to be conducted on the reasonableness standard (see e.g.", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 369 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] )."], ["[18]", "As concerns the third alleged error regarding section 97 of IRPA, given the Board's reasoning in the decision, it is less certain that the applicable standard of review is that of reasonableness. While it is well-settled that the determination of whether an applicant faces a generalized risk is typically one of mixed fact and law and, thus, reviewable on a reasonableness standard (see e.g.", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2009] FCJ No 270;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 520 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (2012)]), in the case at bar the RPD found there to be both a unique personalized risk of being targeted for death", "and", "a generalized risk faced by the applicant. Arguably, such a finding engages a question of the interpretation to be afforded to section 97(1)(b) of IRPA as a matter of law. If so, the applicable standard of review might well be correctness as opposed to reasonableness."], ["[19]", "There are conflicting decisions from this Court regarding the appropriate standard of review to be applied to RPD decisions interpreting the meaning to be given to sections 97 (or 96) of IRPA.

The nature of the \"home statute\" administered by a human rights tribunal makes the task of resolving this tension a particularly delicate one.

If any risk created by \"criminal activity\" is always considered a general risk, it is hard to fathom a scenario in which the requirements of section 97 would ever be met. Instead of focusing on whether the risk is created by criminal activity, the Board must direct its attention to the question before it: whether the claimant would face a personal risk to his or her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and whether that risk is one not faced generally by other individuals in or from the country."], ["[43]", "Similarly, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Zinn found that the RPD had mischaracterized the risk faced by the claimant as a risk of general criminality, even though the gang members, who were trying to recruit the claimant, had violently killed his grandmother before his eyes. Justice Zinn held that the RPD had seriously minimized the nature of the threat faced by the claimant and quashed the Board's decision. In so doing, he noted at para 34 that \"where a person is specifically and personally targeted for death by a gang in circumstances where others are generally not, then he or she is entitled to protection under s. 97 of the Act if the other statutory requirements are met\"."], ["[44]", "To somewhat similar effect, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 38, Justice O'Reilly set aside a decision of the RPD in circumstances where the claimants were victims of extortion, threatened kidnapping and assault. He noted:", "The applicants were originally subjected to threats that are widespread and prevalent in El Salvador. However, subsequent events showed that the applicants were", "specifically targeted", "after they defied the gang. The gang threatened to kidnap [one of the applicant's] wife and daughter, and appear determined to collect the applicants' outstanding \"debt\" of $40,000. The risk to the applicants has gone beyond general threats and assaults.", "The gang has targeted them personally", ". [Emphasis added]"], ["[45]", "Likewise, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras 31 and 32, Justice Scott quashed a decision of the RPD in a case where the claimant, who had been a member of a military task force charged with eradicating the MS 13 and MS 18 gangs, was savagely beaten and threatened with death by gang members. Justice Scott held:", "[T]he applicant has been personally targeted in the past, and will be in future ... contrary to what the Board found, [the risk is] ... personalized in that the participation of the applicant in the Antimaras task force significantly heightened his risk relative to that of young men in El Salvador.", "The Board cited documentary evidence about the influence of the Maras gangs throughout the Americas, and specifically about the dangers inherent in their recruitment practices. The Board found that the applicant's participation in the armed forces stemmed from the fact that he had been targeted for recruitment, and found that the threats and attacks made against him were mainly due to his refusal to join the gang. The Board's view appears to be that there is no relevant distinction between a refusal to join the gang and participation in an anti-gang task force. This Court finds that this is not a reasonable possible conclusion because the applicant's participation in the Antimaras operation has affected and significantly altered the risk he faces from MS 13, so as to make it a personalized risk not faced by other young men in the armed forces or in the population at large. The attempt on his life was triggered by the fact that he had openly fought and participated in the imprisonment of MS 13 gang members."], ["[46]", "In", "Barrios Pineda", "at (at paras 12 and 13), the applicant was a doctor, who had treated a gang member, whom he denounced to the police. Thereafter, he received death threats from the MS, which prompted him to flee El Salvador. Justice Snider set aside the RPD's decision, finding it to be unreasonable. She noted that:", "[O]n a basic level, the Applicant is a victim of crime. However, the facts of this case are unusual in that the Applicant claims to have been personally and directly targeted by MS-18 ... In other words, this is not a generalized fear of being targeted by MS-18 just because the Applicant is a citizen or because of his profile as a doctor. The nature of the risk he now faces is not the same as the risk he faced prior to treating the gang member - before he treated the gang member, he was susceptible to extortion or violence, whereas now he is specifically and individually targeted for his perceived actions, unlike the general population.", "In virtually all of the cases cited by the Respondent, the applicants were not targeted personally", "per se", ". While the gangs may have known their names, their personal information, and may have even threatened them or assaulted them on a number of occasions, the nature of the threat was still generalized. The gang could have gone after anyone with perceived wealth, or any young person who may be recruited into their gang. These people were essentially means to an end for the gang members. I doubt that it really mattered whether person A or person B gave the gang the money for which they were searching, even if both parties were personally threatened. Similarly, I doubt that it really mattered whether person C or person D joined their cause, provided that they continued to increase their membership. The situation before me is fundamentally different. The Applicant presented a story to the Board of being at risk because he was perceived to be a person who \"ratted out\" an individual gang member."], ["[47]", "Similarly, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Noël set aside a decision of the RPD, where the claimant claimed to fear the MS because he had reported the extortion he was facing to the police, along with another vendor, who was killed by the MS. The claimant thereafter received death threats from the MS. Justice Noël held that the applicant was not targeted in the same manner as any other vendor in the market and his risk was different because he faced reprisal for his report to the authorities. Likewise, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Lemieux held that manager of a car dealership, who refused gang extortion and was subsequently threatened, was entitled to protection with his family under section 97 of IRPA. To similar effect, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (2007) at para 15, Justice de Montigny quashed the RPD's decision, holding that:", "It cannot be accepted, by implication at least, that the applicant had been threatened by a well-organized gang that was terrorizing the entire country, according to the documentary evidence, and in the same breath surmise that this same applicant would not be exposed to a personal risk if he were to return to El Salvador. It could very well be that the [MS] recruit from the general population; the fact remains that Mr. Pineda ... had been specifically targeted and was subjected to repeated threats and attacks. On that basis, he was subjected to a greater risk than the risk faced by the population in general."], ["[48]", "In the present case, the RPD determined that the applicant faced a risk of death from the MS but did not elaborate that this was due to his having been a suspected police informant. It thus failed to carry out the first step in the required analysis under section 97 of IRPA. This, in turn, led the Board to conflate the risk faced by the applicant with that faced by all men of the applicant's age in El Salvador, whom it noted all face the risk of recruitment, threats and physical assault by criminal gangs. The Board thus erroneously concluded that the risk faced by the applicant was the same as the risk faced generally by other individuals in El Salvador."], ["[49]", "This finding is both unreasonable and incorrect. In making this determination, I recognize that the reasonableness standard is a deferential one and provides that the Court may intervene only if it is satisfied that the reasons of the tribunal are not \"justified, transparent or intelligible\"", "and", "that the result does not fall \"within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of facts and law\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47). The RPD's determination in the present case is unreasonable because its ruling irrationally concludes that the applicant was in the same situation as any other young man in El Salvador, when this patently was not the case."], ["[50]", "Like the claimants in the many cases cited above, the applicant in this case faced a heightened and different risk not faced by other young men in El Salvador because the MS had threatened him in order to obtain retribution for his having spoken to the police and provided Carlos' mother's address to them. Carlos was shown to have joined the MS and he personally made a death threat to the applicant. The applicant's situation was thus fundamentally different from that of others, who might be generally at risk of recruitment, threats or even assault by the MS. The applicant, though, was found to directly and personally face the risk of death. This is a far cry from the risk of extortion, recruitment or assault and thus the applicant's risk is much more significant and more direct than that faced by other men in El Salvador. Accordingly, the RPD's decision is both unreasonable and incorrect.", "V.", "CONCLUSION"], ["[51]", "In light of the foregoing, the RPD's decision will be set aside and the applicant's claim will be remitted to the RPD for re-determination by a differently constituted panel of the Board."], ["[52]", "No question for certification under section 74 of IRPA was presented and none arises in this case as the errors committed by the Board are closely tied to the facts of this case and the issue of which standard of review is applicable is not determinative to the result I have reached.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[53]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "1. This application for judicial review of the RPD's decision is granted;", "2. The RPD's decision is set aside;", "3.

He was diagnosed with a profound bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment. The Applicant discussed possible treatments for Carlos with the multi-disciplinary team of doctors and specialists at Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital in Alberta, one of the major centres in Canada for Cochlear implantation. The Cochlear Implant team at Glenrose is a multi-disciplinary team of medical professionals, including speech language pathologists, educators of the deaf, audiologists, psychologists, social workers, ear nose and throat surgeons and pediatricians. Carlos was later assessed as a possible candidate for the surgery, and he successfully underwent surgery on May 28, 2009. Since then, he has made considerable improvements and is now able to use single words and word approximations to indicate his wants and needs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "In response to this first letter, the Applicant submitted, among other things, a letter from Dr. Gail Andrew, a Developmental Pediatrician and Medical Site Lead in Pediatrics at Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. After summarizing the bilateral Cochlear implantation procedure, the surgery Carlos underwent and his subsequent progress, she stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Carlos has already shown that he has benefited from the Cochlear Implantation and it is anticipated that he will continue to benefit. To continue to make progress, he will require ongoing oral rehabilitation and programming which is readily available at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. There are some other rehabilitation centres in Canada who would be able to provide this level of support. It will be most unlikely that he will receive this type of care if he is to return to Manila. The cost to support Carlos around his disability has already been paid in terms of the expense of the device and surgery. With his at least average non-verbal intelligence, Carlos is in a position to be a functional and contributing member of society. The current literature on early Cochlear Implantation indicates that these children are most likely to be able to attend their education in mainstream placement and have a lower dependence on special education support services. In the province of Alberta, those children served by our Cochlear Implantation Service at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital are demonstrating that outcome. Carlos and other children with Cochlear Implantation cannot be compared to children with similar levels of hearing impairment without the advantage of the Cochlear Implant device. I would like to request that Carlos' application for immigration be reconsidered based on the fact that the most costly part of his treatment has already been provided here in Canada and it will be unlikely that he will receive rehabilitation services that he needs to fully benefit from the device if he is not living in a major centre with access to the services such as those at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "In another letter, the principals of an elementary school wrote to say that they would welcome Carlos in their Junior Kindergarten Program, where he would be provided the support of a teacher and special needs assistant to accommodate his learning.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "Upon review of the material filed by the Applicant, another medical officer determined that it was likely Carlos will require special education support over the next several years.

The Medical Officer concluded that Carlos has a health condition that might reasonably be expected to cause an excessive demand on social services. Specifically, that it might reasonably be expected that he will require social service costs for Code 45 funding in Alberta (based on the above-noted Government of Alberta Education document) in the amount of $24,560 per year for 1 year of kindergarten and $16,465 per year for 4 years of elementary school, totalling $90,420 over 5 years.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "In view of the new medical assessment, according to which Carlos was medically inadmissible because his health condition might reasonably be expected to cause an excessive demand on social services, the Visa Officer sent another procedural fairness letter to Mr. Perez dated June 9, 2010.

In this letter, Dr. Andrew reiterated the progress made by Carlos and her view that Carlos would be able to attend a regular inclusive classroom setting, with minimal support of a teacher's assistant and consultation by a speech language pathologist. She also noted that the Alberta Minister of Education had reviewed information on Carlos and provided a letter of support for Carlos and his family in their application for permanent residence. She concluded:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "I feel that Carlos will not be a burden to the health, education or social services in the province of Alberta. As previously stated, the majority of his health costs have already been incurred and the cost for ongoing Audiology monitoring is minimal. He has excellent general health and except for unforeseen health issues which can occur to anyone across their lifetime, I feel that he will not be a burden. In terms of cost to the educational system, he will be able to participate in a regular classroom setting with quite minimal human support such as a teachers assistant and will benefit from technology devises that all students benefit from. In terms of cost to social services Carlos has a stable and supportive family. His father is gainfully employed in the province of Alberta and is financially stable. ( ...) If Carlos is to return to the Phillipines, he will be unable to access the level of monitoring of the Cochlear Implant device and appropriate educational services. He will not have access to a centre such as the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital where we are very experienced with Cochlear Implantation. As a result of the success of his Cochlear Implant device, Carlos can not be compared to a child with a similar diagnosis of hearing impairment who has not had the advantage of Cochlear Implant device.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "Mr. Perez also provided a letter from the Principal of Southview Child Care, a private Early Childhood Services Operator, who took exception with a statement of the Visa Officer that Carlos is expected to cause excessive demand on health and social programs. The letter states, inter alia:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "I believe that this statement is incorrect, as Carlos no longer has a health condition. He is now a hearing child and, although he will require auditory monitoring at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital, I strongly believe that Carlos will not require on-going supports as a student and later, as an adult. He has no other medical issues that will prevent him from being able to participate in the regular classroom setting. Our school jurisdiction will access Program Unit Funding for Carlos beginning September 2010 and possibly in the fall of 2011. These funds will enable our school to provide Carlos with support as he is learning how to use his implant and help him to integrate successfully into the classroom setting. It has been my experience in working with children with cochlear implants over the past twenty years that these children are extremely successful and, therefore, Carlos will not be a cause of excessive demand on health, education and social services and/or that he will require services costing over the average Canadian.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "Finally, Mr. Perez also sent a letter from his employer, stating that he earns $129,000.00 per year and is covered, with his family, by the company's comprehensive benefit plan which includes extensive support for his son's medical condition.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "The Applicant's documents and letters submitted in response to the June 2010 procedural fairness letter were forwarded to Immigration Medical Services in Ottawa for consideration by the Medical Officer to assess whether this information altered the previous medical opinion that Carlos' medical condition would cause excessive demand on social services. The Medical Officer noted that despite his Cochlear implant, Carlos still qualifies for special education funding under code 45 (Deafness-Severe Disability). Alberta Education defines a student/child with a severe to profound hearing loss as one that has a hearing loss of 71 decibels or more unaided in the better ear, or has a Cochlear implant preceded by a 71 decibels hearing loss and requires specialized educational supports. Previous reports on file and the new reports submitted confirm that since Carlos' hearing loss occurred prior to his acquisition of normal aural/oral language skills, he will require specialized educational support for the next several years.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "Program Unit Funding referred to by the Principal at Southview Child Care, is funding provided to school authorities by Alberta Education for Early Childhood Services, for children with severe disabilities who require additional support beyond what is offered in the regular early childhood education program. Program Unit Funding is provided for individualized programming that meets the education needs of children with severe disabilities or delays, who are less than 6 years of age and may be paid for a maximum of 3 years for each eligible child. Carlos' intended school (Southview) stated that it intended to access this funding for September 2010 and possibly for the fall of 2011.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "The Medical Officer determined that even if Carlos only needed specialized educational support in the classroom for the next two years, the Program Unit Funding would amount to $41,025 ($24,560 for kindergarten and $16,465 for Grade 1). This amount is well over the 5 year threshold of $27,525, for that period, for excessive demand. The Applicant did not submit any plan to offset the social services cost of special educational support. Therefore, based upon the results of the medical examinations and all the reports received, including the information presented by the Applicant in response to the June 9, 2010 fairness letter, the Medical Officer concluded that the new information does not modify the previous medical opinion that Carlos is medically inadmissible under paragraph 38(1)(c) of", "IRPA", "due to a health condition that might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health and social services.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "The Visa Officer reviewed the file contents, the medical opinion and all documents submitted in response to the June 2010 procedural fairness letter.

To support that proposition, the Applicant relies on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where it was held that in considering \"excessive demand\" the medical officer and the visa officer must necessarily take into account the availability, scarcity or cost of publicly funded services, along with the willingness and ability of the applicant or his or her family to pay for the services.

This, it seems to me, requires individualized assessments. It is impossible, for example, to determine the \"nature\", \"severity\" or probable \"duration\" of a health impairment without doing so in relation to a given individual.

Indeed, the Principal of Southview never said that they will access the Program Unit Funding of the province for the full amount available, or for the next two years. In assuming that the school will seek funding for the maximum amount of $41,025, the Medical Officer did not really consider the submissions made on behalf of Carlos, his actual needs and the probable demands for specialized educational support.

The form letter proposed by the Operational Bulletin states, in part, as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Before I make a final decision, you have the opportunity to submit additional information that addresses any or all of the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "• the medical condition(s) identified;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "• social services required in Canada for the period indicated above; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "• your individualized plan to ensure that no excessive demand will be imposed on Canadian social services for the entire period indicated above and your signed Declaration of Ability and Intent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ". . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "In order to demonstrate that you/your family member will not place an excessive demand on social services, if permitted to immigrate to Canada, you must establish to the satisfaction of the assessing officer that you have a reasonable and workable plan, along with the financial means and intent to implement this plan, in order to offset the excessive demand that you would otherwise impose on social services, after immigrating to Canada.

You may also submit any information addressing the issue of excessive demand if it applies to your case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[44]", "This was far from being explicit enough to apprise the Applicant of the Visa Officer's concern that the Applicant had not submitted a detailed plan. Counsel for the Respondent argued that it would be elevating form over substance to require that the wording of the fairness letter be exactly the same as that found in the form letter appended to the Operations Manual. I cannot agree more with that proposition, as long as the language chosen by the Visa Officer appropriately conveys his concern to an applicant. Here, the Applicant was left in the dark as to what precisely was required of him, in terms of addressing the Visa Officer's preoccupations on the issue of excessive demand. The problem is compounded by the fact that the Visa Officer did not send a Declaration of Ability and Intent to the Applicant to be signed and returned. Had the Applicant received such a Declaration, his attention would have been drawn to the need to present a detailed plan in order to avoid any excessive demand on Canadian social services.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[45]", "This case is indistinguishable from the decision of my colleague Justice Barnes  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> - <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where he found that the Applicant was not properly notified of the Visa Officer's concern in similar circumstances. A similar notification was also found to be lacking by Justice Kelen in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 26. Counsel for the Respondent tried to argue that these cases are inconsistent with the decision of the Court of Appeal in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where it was held that a medical officer is not obligated to seek out information about an applicant's ability and intent to mitigate excessive demands on social services from the outset of the inquiry, provided that the fairness letter gives an applicant a fair opportunity to respond to any concerns. However, the Court added an important", "caveat", ": the fairness letter must clearly set out all of the relevant concerns and provide a true opportunity to meaningfully respond to all of the concerns of the medical officer. Indeed, the fairness letter sent by the visa officer in that case closely followed the form letter stipulated in the respondent's Operational Bulletin.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[46]", "For all of the foregoing reasons, I am therefore of the view that the fairness letters fell short of the requirements set forth in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and did not adequately spell out the information sought by the Visa Officer. As a result, it cannot be said that the Applicant was provided with full and clear notice of the case to be met, nor did he receive a full and fair opportunity to present relevant evidence that would have enabled the Visa Officer to make an individualized assessment of his case. This clearly amounts to a breach of the Applicant's right to procedural fairness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "c) Was the H&C assessment reasonable?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[47]", "As I have found that the decision of the Visa Officer must be quashed both because it is unreasonable and because it is in breach of procedural fairness, I need not answer this third question.

First of all, the Visa Officer specifically considered the H&C grounds submitted by Mr. Perez and noted, specifically, the Applicant's claim that Cochlear implants are rare in Philippines and that Carlos would not have access to the technology, rehabilitation and training enabling Carlos to benefit fully from his surgery. He nevertheless dismissed this claim of hardship, on the basis that the Applicant did not provide any specific information or research to support it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[50]", "The person making an H&C application bears the onus of satisfying the immigration officer that, in his or her personal circumstances, an exemption to", "IRPA", "requirements is justified on H&C grounds. To that extent, bald assertions suggesting that medical and social services are not available in the Philippines were not sufficient to meet that onus. The fact that he relies for these bald assertions on information from his Canadian pediatrician and day-care director does not bolster his case.

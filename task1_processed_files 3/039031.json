The Applicant lists several points that he feels the IAD ignored. However, several of these points were listed in the IAD's reasons and despite the submissions of the Applicant, underlie the IAD's conclusion that Conares Canada was a business of convenience. For example, the fact that the Applicant's UAE residence permit issued on September 15, 2008 was sponsored by United Metal Supply, the company that the Applicant worked for prior to landing in Canada and a company also owned by Mr. Bhatia, a director of Conares Canada and Conares in Dubai, reasonably suggests, as found by the IAD, that the Applicant had been working for the same company in the UAE and in Canada. This bolsters, rather than diminishes, the IAD's finding regarding the purpose for which Conares Canada was established. This finding is further supported by the fact that no financial information was provided for the company after 2006 and there are no longer any employees of Conares Canada in Canada. The Applicant offers nothing to show that this finding was unreasonable and outside the range of possible defensible conclusions. The task of this Court on judicial review is not to re-weigh or re-examine the evidence, but rather to make sure that the reasoning can stand up to a somewhat probing examination (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 438 at para 34).

The record discloses that the applicant's cousin was in mortal danger in Sri Lanka. Relatives called the applicant and asked for his help. He determined that he could not arrange his cousin's entry into Canada by lawful means, and he therefore agreed to meet her in Singapore for the purpose of escorting her to Canada. He helped her obtain a false Sri Lankan passport which she destroyed before her arrival in Canada. She applied for Convention refugee status upon her arrival in Canada, and has since been accepted as a Convention refugee. The applicant received no payment for helping his cousin.

He argues that, following an election, the fact that the prosecution could have been by indictment becomes irrelevant and the Passport Office loses its jurisdiction to revoke for the commission of an indictable offence. I am not able to agree with this submission for two reasons. Firstly, the", "Interpretation Act", "makes it clear in section 34(1)(a) that it is the terms of the enactment which state that an accused may be prosecuted for an offence by indictment that creates the indictable offence. The Crown's election does not change the terms of the enactment. Secondly, the election is not necessarily determinative of the procedure which will ultimately be used to deal with the charges. There have been cases where charges were laid and an election was made to proceed by way of summary conviction. Thereafter, before the accused entered a plea, the Crown re-elected and proceeded by indictment.

The paragraph simply provides that, where the", "Criminal Code", "gives to the prosecutor discretion with respect to the most appropriate mode of proceeding against an accused, and an accused is found guilty of such an offence on summary conviction, that person shall not be considered as having been found guilty of an indictable offence.

He had for consideration an applicant who had admitted that he had committed an indictable offence.

What changed at the time of conviction was that he could not be said to have been convicted of an indictable offence. This, however, did not alter the fact that he had committed such an offence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "I have considered whether this conclusion makes practical sense and I have decided that it does. The Passport Office is concerned, among other things, with passport integrity and security. It makes sense that it would be entitled to revoke a passport if a potentially serious, i.e., an indictable, offence were committed. If it turned out that the offence was not actually very serious, the Director would have the discretion not to revoke a passport or to impose a short period of revocation. Because criminal proceedings are not a condition precedent to the revocation of a passport, it seems logical that the objectives of the Passport Office may be pursued without being thwarted if a summary conviction is obtained in respect of an indictable offence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Issue 2 - The Exercise of Discretion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "On this issue, the respondent urged me to accord the highest deference to the Director and to review his exercise of discretion only if I found it to be patently unreasonable.

This, as counsel for both parties acknowledged, was an error. There is no queue for refugee claimants and there are no refugee camps in Sri Lanka. However, counsel for the respondent submitted that the error must have been of no importance given that, in spite of the error, the Director reduced the period of revocation by 15 months.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "I am unable to agree with this submission. In my view, the Director was very troubled by what he perceived to be the unjust consequences of the applicant's conduct. The Director said:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"It is not for me to formulate an opinion as to the merits of any refugee claim. Counsel's argument is to be verified against Canada's policy of welcoming and settling a significant number of refugees. If passport holders 'select' (by virtue of their assistance), in lieu of humanitarian or Non Profit Organizations, family members who could apply to be sponsored under the United Nations Refugee Program, they jump ahead of people who are awaiting in refugee camps to settle in foreign lands. Inasmuch as it is inappropriate for me to ignore the circumvention of the immigration process, I find it difficult to absolve subjects who would engage in such activities, whatever their objectives, beliefs and reasons, given that there are hundreds of thousands of waiting, law-abiding Convention refugees who are sponsored by recognized world humanitarian organizations. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "And later, the Director said:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"I am prepared to give the subject the benefit of the doubt in accepting the argument that his actions were motivated for 'compassionate' reasons.

On the latter occasion, the men demanded to be granted use of space in the applicant's factory for storing weapons. The men also threatened to kill the applicant if he did not comply. He believed they belonged to the Taliban. Mr. Sediqi asked for time to consider this demand, and stayed home from work for the next two weeks. He returned to work on January 23, 2014, but varied his hours. When leaving work one evening, some of the same men approached him in his car, repeated their demand as well as their threats, and assaulted him. After this encounter, Mr. Sediqi decided to move himself and his family to his father-in-law's residence in another part of Kabul. He stopped going to work and had his foreman close his factory."], ["[4]", "Mr. Sediqi had a US visa (unused from a trade exhibition he had been unable to attend), which he used to travel to New York on February 17, 2014. He did not make an asylum claim while in the US, later explaining that he thought Canada would be a better place for himself and his children. On March 1, 2014, Mr. Sediqi entered Canada by walking across the border at the Peace Arch Crossing. On March 11, 2014, he claimed refugee status. After leaving Afghanistan, Mr. Sediqi received a \"night letter\" via his brother, which had been delivered to his factory in Kabul. This letter included threats on the applicant's life."], ["[5]", "The RPD refused Mr. Sediqi's refugee claim on June 23, 2014, finding, on the basis of a lack of credibility and of subjective fear, that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.

Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(b) of the IRPA, Member Dhir confirmed the determination of the RPD that the applicant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA."], ["[7]", "Member Dhir acknowledged in her decision that the RAD, being a new division, has struggled with the standard of review to be used in assessing RPD appeals.

While the country reports indicate that wealthy businesspeople may be at risk of extortion that may amount to persecution, Member Dhir found that there was no persuasive evidence that the applicant was being extorted in this way, since his testimony indicates that he was never asked for money, and his family has not been approached since he left Afghanistan."], ["[11]", "Member Dhir concluded that in consideration of the evidence before the RPD and then the RAD, the applicant would not face persecution and, on a balance of probabilities, would not be subjected to cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, or danger of torture, if he returned to Afghanistan.

Paragraph 41 concludes with the observation that there is no persuasive evidence of any such targeting of family members in this case.

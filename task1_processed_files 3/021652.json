These are good examples of crimes that are sufficiently serious to presumptively warrant exclusion from refugee protection. However, as indicated, the presumption may be rebutted in a particular case. While consideration of whether a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada is a useful guideline, and crimes attracting a maximum sentence of ten years or more in Canada will generally be sufficiently serious to warrant exclusion,", "the ten-year rule should not be applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized, or unjust manner", "[Emphasis added]"], ["[17]", "The Respondent argues that", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "has limited application to cases involving fugitives from prosecution; given that it is factual foundation was based upon a claimant who had been convicted of a crime in another country.

As I understand the evidence, he provides the same services to members of LTTE as he does to the general public, somewhat comparable to selling an essential commodity like fuel to run their trucks, although obviously more specialized and less available by his professional training and expertise. He did not have the intention to support the LTTE, but is forced into it and finds out a year and a half later who he is dealing with. I think a sentencing court would tend to be somewhat sympathetic about his situation in a war zone, with a family and dealing with a terrorist organization fighting an ethnic war where, by providing a service offered to the public, he must flee giving up a business he has tried to build, or face putting his life and that of his family at risk.

Such beliefs are often immutable. Thus, Mr. Thambaithurai's lack of remorse was perhaps not surprising, given his Tamil heritage, the impact of the war on his family, and his continuing concern for the dire circumstances of the Tamil population in Sri Lanka. The sentencing judge, however, concluded Mr. Thambaithurai did not present an ongoing terrorist threat, given his otherwise good character. Moreover, by the time Mr. Thambaithurai came before the courts, concern about further terrorist financing of the LTTE had been abated by events in Sri Lanka. In May 2009, Prabhakaran was killed and the Sri Lankan government declared victory over the LTTE.", "[...]"], ["[24] Nor am I persuaded that the sentence of six months' incarceration was unfit.

There is really no evidence of what the LTTE did with their computers. Once into speculation there normally would be a reasonable doubt preventing conviction.

There are examples, and section 16 of the", "CCAA", "is one of them, where Parliament has given specific jurisdiction to one superior court to stay proceedings in another superior court. In my view, such a disposition requires express language."], ["[10]", "Superior courts do not order each other about or make orders interfering with each other's process. Rather, it is essential that they should cooperate. Conflicts between courts, or other bodies having ultimate judicial power, may well have serious results, including perhaps even loss of liberty [see footnote 3]. In Canada, superior courts do not compete with one another. They accord to one another \"full faith and credit,\" as was said in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  order specifically requests that this Court, in comity, and more than that, in recognition of the fact that both courts are engaged in a single legal system in the administration of Canadian justice, should lend its aid to the order of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice staying proceedings."], ["[11]", "It has been said to me this morning that I should not grant a stay order based on Justice Farley's orders first because I have no evidence before me and second because there has been no attempt to justify a stay in the terms of the classic three part test originally enunciated by the Supreme Court in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  stay granted in comity does not need to meet the requirements of that test and does not need evidence; it is my view that the proper attitude of respectful cooperation which this Court should have and does have to judgments of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice will require that, as a matter of course, in virtually every case where an order is given by a provincial superior court in the exercise of its", "CCAA", "jurisdiction, and that order requests this Court's aid, this Court will give such aid on proper application being made."], ["[12]", "That is not the end of the matter. If a party to proceedings in this Court thinks that a stay should not be granted in comity and in aid of a provincial superior court order, it is at liberty to oppose the stay or, if the stay is granted, apply to this Court to have it lifted. The plaintiffs would thus have been free to bring evidence today and make representations to me that for some reasons or other these proceedings ought not to be stayed, but matters did not develop in that way. Let me be quite clear. The burden is on a person seeking in this Court to avoid the consequences of this Court acting in aid of a provincial superior court exercising its jurisdiction under the", "CCAA", ". The burden is on that person to show this Court that it should not act in aid. Nothing that I say or do today forecloses the plaintiffs from making an application if they so wish. I say that simply because in the way in which these proceedings developed, it was agreed between counsel and the Court that we should deal with this matter today strictly on issues of law, matters of fact being left to another day, if necessary."], ["[13]", "That said, however, I have some difficulty seeing on what basis plaintiffs might persuade me that I am the right person to decide that these proceedings should go forward notwithstanding the", "CCAA", "proceedings. Certainly, insofar as the considerations involved are considerations relating to the administration of the insolvent companies, the proper court to make that determination is the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Some argument was addressed to me this morning on the alleged impropriety of the order of May 16, 2003, the recognition order in the United Airlines case. I reject that argument not on its merits or on its substance as to which I make no comment, but simply on the basis that I am not the right person to decide whether or not Justice Farley made a mistake. I note that his order was given ex parte. I also note that the plaintiffs had notice of it but chose, for reasons of their own, not to appear. It is still, as I understand the terms of that order and the \"comeback\" clause in it, open to the plaintiffs to make an application to Justice Farley and to urge before him various grounds upon which they think it is wrong and unjust that they should be obliged to submit their claims against United Airlines to the Bankruptcy Court in the United States. Those arguments will no doubt, if they get made, receive the consideration that they deserve."], ["[14]", "I think it is likewise with respect to the case of Air Canada. Air Canada is under the protection of the", "CCAA", ". The stay order's purpose is, of course, to permit a structured environment in which the company can attempt to reorganize and go forward with its business in possession of its assets [see footnote 8]."], ["[15]", "In the exercise of a restructuring, the company has to be left in possession of its assets and those assets have to be protected against creditors. The reality is that this action being in its early stages and being a proposed class action is unlikely to get anywhere near to a point where it would have any impact on Air Canada's assets before the end of the", "CCAA", "proceedings and on that basis, it may be possible to persuade Justice Farley that this action should be allowed to go forward."], ["[16]", "There is, however, one matter on which I think that only Justice Farley can decide and that is the third basis for the stay order which is to allow the company to concentrate its efforts on the reorganization and not to be distracted by the defence of other claims. That is a matter on which I have no information at all and on which I suspect Justice Farley has or will have in due course ample information. Personally, it would seem to me that the impact on Air Canada's efforts at reorganization of having to file materials in the certification application would be minimal and I also would have thought that the likelihood of Air Canada not emerging from the reorganization procedures would be pretty minimal as well but those are not matters which I can really deal with."], ["[17]", "I granted an interim stay on May 2, 2003 of my scheduling order dated February 21, 2003 with respect to the exchange of materials on the application for certification and by the order which I make today, I am going to extend that stay for a further period of 3 months unless Justice Farley should, in the interim, lift the underlying stays in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and therefore, the reasons for this stay. I will give counsel a date which, as it happens is the date that we had already reserved for this case. We had thought it was going to be the date on which we would argue the certification motion, September 3, 2003. A stay order will go in this action effective until September 3, 2003 or until the stay orders issued by Justice Farley of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice are lifted, which ever shall first occur."], ["[18]", "Plaintiffs have leave, if they so desire, to move this Court to lift the stay order. It has been given without evidence and solely on the basis of this Court's duty to act in aid of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. If plaintiffs, upon reflection, decide that this is what they want to do, they should take an appointment with the registrar and we would conduct a quick telephone conference to set a time table and we would all meet again."], ["[19]", "That really concludes what I have to say with this exception, both parties have sought costs.

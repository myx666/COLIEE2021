As to the difference between the Respondent's signature as a 19-year-old in her 1975 passport and her signature as a 56-year-old in her citizenship application, it is unsurprising that in a thirty-five year time span her signature changed.

However, the officer's December 29, 2011 FOSS notes state that she \"suggested if subj takes TTC, perhaps she could give us a copy of her previous TTC monthly pass photo; subj then said \"I don't travel by TTC every day, never purchased any TTC passes\". And, in the officer's hand written File Referral Sheet for the July 7, 2011 meeting, she records \"Don't travel TTC everyday, never purchased TTC pass\".

While she reported two absences there were actually four which occurred in 1978, 1979, 1981 and 1984, being short trips to the United States and two trips to Trinidad & Tobago in November. These are outside the relevant residency period and the error is again attributed to the impact of the passage of time on the Respondent's memory.

Information on the official website of Saskatchewan Immigration confirms that new immigrants would \"need to understand and speak English to do most things in Saskatchewan\" and, relating specifically to employment, that \"To do most jobs well, a minimum of a [Canadian Language] benchmark 4 is recommended.\" A Canadian Language Benchmark of 4 would equate to an IELTS score of at least Listening 4.5, Reading 3.5, Writing 4.0, and Speaking 4.0. The Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP) requires nominees to prove their English language ability and, if an IELTS test is submitted as proof, a score of \"a minimum of equivalent of CLB 4 [is required] in all categories.\" Although your individual scores for Speaking, Writing, and Reading were at or above the minimum recommended level, you scored below the minimum recommended level in Listening.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "As well, the SINP has stated that nominees also must have \"the English language ability either to do the job you have been offered by a Saskatchewan employer or to get a job in your field of education or training.\" You have not indicated having been offered a job by a Saskatchewan employer.

I am not satisfied you have the language skills to be able to perform the duties required of either occupation. Work as a cashier typically requires interaction with the public and understanding of specific service requirements and information. Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) identifies Oral Communication as one of the most important essential skills to perform work as a cashier and the level of language ability to perform the tasks typically required of a cashier would need to be more than basic or moderate. HRSDC identifies Oral Communication, Reading Text, Document Use, and Writing as among the essential skills to perform work as a teacher, with Oral Communication identified as one of the most important. In order to be a teacher in Saskatchewan, one must also obtain teacher certification for which fluency in English or French would be a requirement. It does not appear that you have the English language proficiency to obtain teacher certification in Saskatchewan or to successfully complete additional training which you may need in order to be eligible for certification. With the level of English language ability you have demonstrated, I am not satisfied that you would be able to perform the tasks of your intended occupation or that for which you have been nominated. I am therefore not satisfied you would be able to become employed in Canada or, if you did find employment, that it would be of a sufficient level for you to become economically established. I have also noted that you have indicated having support of a family member residing in Saskatchewan, but support by a family member would not be considered economic establishment and would not be sufficient to outweigh the concerns over your low level of English language ability.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The GCMS notes, dated November 28, 2013, provide the Officer's evaluation of the Applicant's response to this letter (Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] at 3):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Apart fr submitting another IELTS result, PA has not addressed the concerns outlined in the P/F ltr.

PA says she was offered a job as cashier, but provides no evidence or details of this or any other job offer. The results of the 2nd IELTS test show PA's overall band score to have improved slightly from 4.5 to 5.0, putting her English proficiency in the range of a \"Modest User\" which IELTS describes as having \"partial command of the language, coping with overall meaning in most situations, though is likely to make many mistakes. Should be able to handle basic communication in own field.\" Note that PA's field is indicated as teaching, not working as cashier. PA's individual scores on the 2nd IELTS test for Listening, Writing, & for Speaking were 5.0 or 5.5, but her individual score for Reading is 4.0 (\"Limited User\"). PA's English lang proficiency according to 2nd IELTS test is now at CLB 5 which is still basic proficiency.

There is a considerable amount of repetition in her submissions, but the principal assertions appear to be:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "a) The Officer must evaluate the likelihood of the ability of the foreign national to become economically established in Canada by conducting an adequate substitute assessment on proper grounds;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "b) In conducting this evaluation, the Officer is obliged to take into account such matters as age, education, qualifications, past employment experience, the province's views, and motivation and initiative;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "c) In the present case, the Officer did not properly consider the Applicant's age, education, qualifications, past employment experience, job offer approved by the province, the Applicant's husband's skills and work experience, and the province's views in evaluating the likelihood of the Applicant's likelihood of her ability to become economically established in Canada;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "d) The Officer also failed to consider the husband's age, education, qualifications, past employment experience, and the fact that the husband has been working as a construction worker since 2002 (an occupation that is in high demand in Saskatchewan); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "e) The Officer relied solely on the Applicant's IELTS examination results to conclude that the nomination certificate by the province was not a sufficient indicator of whether she may become economically established in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[54]", "The reasons for the Decision are scattered throughout the GCMS notes, the Procedural Fairness Letter of March 28, 2013, and the refusal letter of January 10, 2014.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[55]", "The Procedural Fairness Letter sets out the framework and scope of the Officer's considerations (Applicant's Record at 105):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The provincial nominee class is an economic immigrant category. Economic immigrants are defined on Citizenship and Immigration's official website (www.cic.gc.ca) as being \"selected for their skills and ability to contribute to the Canadian economy.\" Subsection 87 of Canada's Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) describes the provincial nominee class as \"a class of persons who may become permanent residents on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada\" and who \"are named in a nomination certificate issued by the government of a province under a provincial nomination agreement between that province and the Minister, and ... intend to reside in the province that has nominated them.\" The definition of provincial nominee is further explained on www.cic.gc.ca as \"Economic immigrants selected by a province or territory for specific skills that will contribute to the local economy to meet specific labour market needs.\" In order for applicants to become economically established it is therefore expected that they will be able to obtain employment in Canada. Nominations issued by provinces are considered as initial evidence that nominees have the ability to become economically established in Canada and will be of economic benefit to the province and have met the requirements of the province's Provincial Nominee Program. Canada is responsible for exercising the final selection authority and ensuring that applicants admitted under the program have met the requirements for membership in the economic class. Notwithstanding your nomination by a province or territory, I am not satisfied that the information provided with your permanent residence application indicates you have the ability to become economically established in Canada or that you otherwise meet the definition of a provincial nominee as per Subsection 87 of the IRPR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[56]", "The focus of the Officer's concerns are found in the final three paragraphs of that letter (Applicant's Record at 106):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The ability to communicate effectively in one of Canada's official languages is recognized as a vitally important factor in becoming economically established. Information on the official website of Saskatchewan Immigration confirms that new immigrants would \"need to understand and speak English to do most things in Saskatchewan\" and, relating specifically to employment, that \"To do most jobs well, a minimum of a [Canadian Language] benchmark 4 is recommended.\" A Canadian Language Benchmark of 4 would equate to an IELTS score of at least Listening 4.5, Reading 3.5, Writing 4.0, and Speaking 4.0. The Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP) requires nominees to prove their English language ability and, if an IELTS test is submitted as proof, a score of \"a minimum of equivalent of CLB 4 [is required] in all categories.\" Although your individual scores for Speaking, Writing, and Reading were at or above the minimum recommended level, you scored below the minimum recommended level in Listening.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "As well, the SINP has stated that nominees also must have \"the English language ability either to do the job you have been offered by a Saskatchewan employer or to get a job in your field of education or training.\" You have not indicated having been offered a job by a Saskatchewan employer. The occupation in which you have been nominated is cashier. The occupation in which you indicate having experience and which you also indicate you intend to pursue in Canada is teaching. I am not satisfied you have the language skills to be able to perform the duties required of either occupation. Work as a cashier typically requires interaction with the public and understanding of specific service requirements and information. Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) identifies Oral Communication as one of the most important essential skills to perform work as a cashier and the level of language ability to perform the tasks typically required of a cashier would need to be more than basic or moderate. HRSDC identifies Oral Communication, Reading Text, Document Use, and Writing as among the essential skills to perform work as a teacher, with Oral Communication identified as one of the most important. In order to be a teacher in Saskatchewan, one must also obtain teacher certification for which fluency in English or French would be a requirement. It does not appear that you have the English language proficiency to obtain teacher certification in Saskatchewan or to successfully complete additional training which you may need in order to be eligible for certification. With the level of English language ability you have demonstrated, I am not satisfied that you would be able to perform the tasks of your intended occupation or that for which you have been nominated. I am therefore not satisfied you would be able to become employed in Canada or, if you did find employment, that it would be of a sufficient level for you to become economically established. I have also noted that you have indicated having support of a family member residing in Saskatchewan, but support by a family member would not be considered economic establishment and would not be sufficient to outweigh the concerns over your low level of English language ability.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "A copy of this letter is also being sent to the nominating province to advise of the possible refusal of your application and the reasons for it. The province has 90 days to raise concerns or seek clarification from the visa office regarding the assessment of your application, after which the final decision will be made. If you have further information you wish to have considered, you must submit it within the same 90-day time period.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[57]", "My reading of the full record reveals that there is nothing to suggest that the Officer left out of account, or failed to consider, any of the factors put forward by the Applicant. The above quotation indicates that the family support was considered but it did not outweigh the concerns over the Applicant's low level of English language ability. The Officer fully explains his emphasis on this factor for the issue of economic establishment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[58]", "The Officer also acknowledges that \"[n]ominations issued by provinces are considered as initial evidence that nominees have the ability to become economically established in Canada and will be of economic benefit to the province and have met the requirements of the province's Provincial Nominee Program\" (Applicant's Record at 105).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[59]", "The fact that one factor (language ability) is singled out for particular emphasis does not mean that all other material factors were not considered in the weighing process.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[60]", "As the Officer points out, irrespective of all other factors, the Applicant had to demonstrate that she would be able to find employment at a level that would provide the required support for the Applicant and her family and thus achieve economic establishment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[61]", "As the Respondent points out, there is no evidence that the job offer was submitted to the Officer, and the GCMS notes make it clear that there was no evidence of a job offer before the Officer. This means that it was not unreasonable for the Officer to assess the situation himself because he could not be sure that the Applicant had been assessed as qualified by a prospective employer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[62]", "The new IELTS results left the Applicant in the \"modest\" category, which meant she had a partial command of the English language but is still likely to make mistakes. It was not unreasonable for the Officer to conclude that, as a cashier, she would need good language skills to communicate with customers.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[63]", "All in all, this meant that the Applicant had no plan to pursue a teaching career, she had not produced the job offer for a cashier position, and she had only modest language skills in English. It is not difficult to see why the Officer was concerned that the Applicant had not demonstrated how she would become economically established if she came to Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[64]", "The Applicant has not convinced me that the Officer did not conduct a proper and reasonable substitute assessment. She is naturally disappointed and would like the Court to reweigh all of the factors and reach a conclusion that favours her. The Court cannot do this. I am satisfied that the Officer reasonably weighed the factors.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "D. Certification  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"]]}

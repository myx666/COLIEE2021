Dr. Cameron's medical opinion is that Mr. Harkat continues to present significant depressive, post-traumatic stress and anxiety symptoms. His health situation varies depending on the developments in his legal case, the perceived rigidness or unfairness of the enforcement of his bail conditions and the perceived imminence of his possible deportation from Canada. The medical opinion explains that Mr. Harkat disagrees with the findings made in this Court's decision on the reasonableness of the certificate (see", "Harkat (Re)", ", supra) and considers himself mistreated by the Canadian judicial system.

Out of nine requests to travel outside of Ottawa, two (2) were denied because it was not feasible to monitor the trips.", "3.

In addition, CBSA agrees to the possession and use of one (1) basic mobile phone as long as the telephone number and service provider is given to CBSA for the purposes of obtaining and monitoring the mobile phone use and obtaining its records. Mr. Harkat would have to agree to CBSA having such access. The mobile phone would be limited to receiving and making calls, as well as forwarding features from his mobile phone and from his landline telephone but not to any other telephone line. The mobile phone, in CBSA's opinion, should be limited to voice capability and voice mail only.", "8.

It indicates that the risk associated with Mr. Harkat is low as long as the existing terms and conditions remain in place. Up until January 2012, there has been no significant incident of non-compliance with any of the terms and conditions of release. There has been erratic and unusual driving by Mr. Harkat associated with counter-surveillance techniques, but as CBSA notes in the Risk Assessment, this does not constitute a breach of the terms and conditions of release.

Access to the residence was restricted to a limited number of individuals, such as those who had deposited sureties, and his legal counsel.

The Applicant and his wife had to adapt to these stringent terms and conditions, and sometimes they objected. Having said that, they have both adapted in an exemplary way and as seen above, they have complied with the terms and conditions.

As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  #1", ", above at paras 112, 115, this is a significant factor to consider when determining whether to release the named person from detention, and it is also, in my view, significant when evaluating the terms and conditions of release.

Be it the GPS ankle bracelet, the contacts with CBSA personnel, the extra demands on Mrs. Harkat in coordinating compliance with the conditions with CBSA, or the prohibition on Mr. Harket from accessing a mobile phone except in an emergency or a computer with Internet access, all of the terms and conditions result in major inconveniences that are difficult to live with.", "A.", "The determination"], ["[50]", "The Ministers have relied on a threat assessment of September 2009 from CSIS that has not been updated.

Since that time, the CBSA's risk assessment of January 2012 has shown that Mr. Harkat has complied with the terms and conditions of release. The May 8, 2013 affidavit of CBSA Inland Supervisor, Mr. Connelly, confirms that there has been no breach since January 2012 and that the monitoring of the terms and conditions of release has proceeded smoothly. It was also his opinion that some relaxing of the conditions of release was necessary but limited to the following modifications: a seven (7) day notice to CBSA for travel within Canada as long as Mr. Harkat provides the itinerary, the right to use the land-based telephone for both voice and fax transmissions, and access to a basic mobile phone without Internet capacity as long as CBSA has the phone number and supervises it by proper access to the service provider. Moreover, Mrs. Harkat should have the use of a mobile phone with Internet capacity that can only be accessed by her. In the Ministers' views, the GPS supervision must remain in order to be able to determine Mr. Harkat's whereabouts within Canada."], ["[51]", "For the purposes of these reasons, I have read the decision of my colleague Justice Blanchard in", "Mahjoub (Re)", ", above and I agree with his approach and analysis. I am aware that he has relaxed the terms and conditions of release considerably and, as an example, he lifted the conditions requiring a GPS ankle bracelet. However, each procedure must be assessed on its own set of facts.

Here are some of the reasons for this comment:", "1. Mr. Harkat has been under the watchful eyes of the Canadian authorities since his arrival in Canada in 1995, was detained from 2002 to 2006 and was since released from detention with conditions that kept him under full supervision.", "2. Mr. Harkat has not contacted, at least since 2002, any undesirable individual that may connect him directly or indirectly to terrorism.", "3. The terms and conditions of release issued initially and as they were adapted through time have neutralized the danger to the security of Canada as it was periodically assessed.", "4. The last threat assessment dates back to September 2009 and was then considered low. No update has been filed recently. I find that, as of today, the risk of danger remains although it is at the lower end of the spectrum.", "5. At least going back to 2008, Mr. Harkat has respected and complied with the terms and conditions of release. Through his compliant behavior, he has earned a higher level of trust from this Court.", "6. Mrs. Harkat has constantly made sure that Mr. Harkat abided by the terms and conditions of release, and her support of her husband has also added to the trust factor that the Court will take into consideration.", "7. There is medical evidence indicating that Mr. Harkat suffers from the impact of the terms and conditions of release and from the consequences of being subjected to a security certificate."], ["[53]", "Mr. Harkat's request to lift some of the terms and conditions of release therefore must be reviewed so that they may be adapted to this new situation."], ["[54]", "The question is not about permitting Mr. Harkat to engage in everyday activities as it was in the past but rather to ensure a proper supervision of these activities. There is a time for everything and it is now time to move to other considerations."], ["[55]", "There was a time for house arrest, outings with strict supervision and then alone with a GPS and no computer access. As seen above, the circumstances have changed. The initial danger has diminished considerably. Mr. Harkat has complied through time with the strict conditions. Conditions of release therefore have to be adapted to this new favourable reality for Mr. Harkat."], ["[56]", "It is my assessment that the time for a GPS has passed. Since his marriage, Mr. Harkat has adapted to his new environment. He is a well-known person who has developed a stable relationship and new friends. He owes a lot to his family and friends, and he is not in a position to disappoint them by breaching any of the remaining conditions of release. The consequences for him are too important."], ["[57]", "It is also my assessment that a mobile phone, having only the capacity of receiving and making calls and text messaging can be used by Mr. Harkat as long as Mr. Harkat agrees to the CBSA supervision by having the telephone number and access to the information detained by the service provider. Furthermore, at home, he may have access to a desktop computer which shall have internet capacity. Every month, at a time to be decided by CBSA, Mr. Harkat will make the computer available so that it can be accessed by CBSA for inspection at its office. At any other time, with justification, CBSA may ask a designated judge for access to Mr. Harkat's computer.

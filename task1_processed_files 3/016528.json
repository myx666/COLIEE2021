Before the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division (the Board), the applicant alleged that he was forced to work for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the 1990s and was questioned by the army for his role in working with the LTTE. He also alleged being arrested, detained and beaten by the army in 2000 and that he was sought by the LTTE in March 2004.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The Board denied the applicant's refugee claim in August 2006. The Board found that he had failed to establish the well foundedness of his fear or that he was ever detained.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "The applicant then filed H&C and pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) applications. He received negative decisions for these applications on April 14, 2010.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Officer's Decisions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The officer first reviewed the Board's decision and noted that the Board found credibility to be a determinative issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The officer acknowledged the applicant's alleged risks as a Tamil, including needing permission to reside in Colombo and facing daily difficulties living in Jaffna.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The officer's principal concern was the lack of sufficient evidence. The officer found that there was insufficient evidence:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(a) that the applicant had previously been targeted by the state, the LTTE or other non-state agents in Sri Lanka;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(b) that the applicant would likely be targeted if he returned to Sri Lanka;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(c) that the authorities have an interest in the applicant or that his whereabouts is being sought;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(d) that the LTTE have the resources or desire to target the applicant after their defeat by the Sri Lankan government forces; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(e) that due to being out of the country for several years, the applicant will be detained and questioned or of interest to either the authorities or paramilitaries, or that he would be suspected of having LTTE links by the government for the same reason.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "The officer found that the applicant may face risk of being extorted upon return to Sri Lanka, but concluded that the evidence does not indicate that this is a regular occurrence or that these requests for money are linked to a persecutory crime. The officer did not find this to amount to persecution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The officer ultimately concluded that there is not more than a mere possibility that the applicant would face persecution or risk to life or cruel and unusual punishment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "H&C Application  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "The same officer considered the applicant's H&C application. The officer's assessment of risk was similar to that done under the PRRA application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "The officer found that any discrimination and harassment that the applicant would face as an ethnic Tamil would not rise to a level to constitute unusual or disproportionate hardship. The officer noted that the applicant may have to register if living in Colombo, but found that the applicant could live in Jaffna with his parents-in-law and found that there was insufficient evidence that his parents-in-law would be targeted by the authorities or paramilitaries if he did so. The officer accepted that the applicant might have to go through security checkpoints and register with the police, if he returned to Jaffna, but found that this did not amount to unusual or disproportionate hardship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "The officer found that although the applicant might be subjected to extortion demands, he was not satisfied that the applicant would be identified as a wealthy businessman and did not find that this factor alone warranted exceptional in-Canada processing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "The officer considered the applicant's employment and marriage but concluded that these factors did not amount to establishment in Canada such that he would suffer unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if he had to apply for permanent residence from outside of Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "The issues are as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "1.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has noted that Tamil males from northern Sri Lanka may be subject to persecution on cumulative grounds. The applicant relies on", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in which Madam Justice Eleanor Dawson allowed a judicial review where the Board had examined five individual acts of discrimination but failed to assess their cumulative effect on the applicant. The applicant in the case at bar submits that in the H&C decision, the officer accepted that the applicant would be subjected to extortion demands and would face security constraints, police checks and be forced to register with the police in Colombo. However, the officer did not acknowledge all of these risks in the PRRA decision and therefore, did not assess the possibility of cumulative discrimination in the PRRA decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "The applicant further submits that the officer erred in finding that being subject to the opportunistic crime of extortion is not persecution or undue hardship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Respondent's Written Submissions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "The respondent submits that the officer did consider cumulative persecution. The officer explicitly stated in the H&C decision that he considered the claim both \"individually and cumulatively\". While the officer did not make such an explicit statement in the PRRA application, this was unnecessary as there was only evidence of one action which could be found discriminatory. As such, a cumulative persecution analysis was not required. The case law relied on by the applicant, on cumulative persecution, is not persuasive as it relates to instances where the evidence established a series of discriminatory actions, which is not the case here.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "Although the officer accepted that the applicant could be approached for bribes at the airport, the officer found that that this did not amount to persecution or undue hardship because it is only a possibility, it occurs to all Sri Lankans and it is not linked to a persecutory act. In the H&C decision, the officer was not persuaded that the applicant would be identified as a wealthy individual.

For example, in the H&C decision, the officer accepted that the applicant may have to register with police and may be questioned by state security agencies if he wishes to reside in Colombo, or, if he resides in Jaffna, the applicant might be required to proceed through security checkpoints and register with the police.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "These findings of fact were absent from the PRRA decision. As both decisions were made on the same day by the same officer, these findings should have formed part of the PRRA decision and the officer should have assessed whether the applicant would face more than a mere possibility of persecution on the basis of these discriminatory actions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "I cannot know whether the officer would have found cumulative persecution in the PRRA analysis had he considered these other discriminatory events.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "As such, based on the errors of law above, I must allow the judicial review for both the PRRA and H&C applications.

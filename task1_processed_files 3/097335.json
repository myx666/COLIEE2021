Under these circumstances, the Court may be faced with applicant who has been targeted in the past and who may be targeted in the future but whose risk situation is similar to a segment of the larger population. Thus, the Court is faced with an individual who may have a personalized risk, but one that is shared by many other individuals.", "19 Recently, the term \"generally\" was interpreted in a manner that may include segments of the larger population, as well as all residents or citizens of a given country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J.

When the claimant refused, he and his family were threatened, and their home was placed under surveillance.

It could very well be that the Maras Salvatruchas recruit from the general population; the fact remains that Mr. Pineda, if his testimony is to be believed, had been specifically targeted and was subjected to repeated threats and attacks. On that basis, he was subjected to a greater risk than the risk faced by the population in general."], ["[25]", "I agree with the result; however, the decision does not assist these Applicants. The issue as to whether the risk is personal or general in that fact situation is not determined by the fact that the MS recruits from the population generally; it is determined by the fact that the applicant had been personally targeted by the MS for reprisal because he refused to be recruited to their cause. That is a circumstance quite different from that before me in this application.

She alleged harassment, interference, intimidation, retaliation and restrictions concerning her Workers' Compensation claim. The timeframe addressed in her complaint is April 2003 to April 2007. Her complaint makes note of various grievances submitted in connection with workplace activities, alleging racism on the part of her supervisors.

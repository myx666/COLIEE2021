Also, the judge must be satisfied that the person against whom the order is sought is likely to have relevant information. This does not mean that the Court second guesses the Commissioner's decision that he has reasons to believe that the conduct that is the subject of the inquiry in question occurred, but it does allow the Court to refuse to grant an order when there is insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that a bona fide inquiry has been commenced.

To reiterate, these two conditions are that the Commissioner has been satisfied by information on oath or solemn affirmation that an inquiry is being made under section 10 and that a respondent is likely to have information that is relevant to the inquiry.

In communicating their concerns, the Respondents noted this Court's prior admonition that the Commissioner should disclose such concerns to the Court and provide a summary of potentially overlapping information previously obtained from them ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 77-78, 88-91, 95-97)."], ["[61]", "At the Respondents' request, and perhaps having regard to that admonition, the Commissioner disclosed both the correspondence that predated the filing of this application and the subsequent correspondence that was filed prior to the hearing."], ["[62]", "In their correspondence, the Respondents stated, among other things, that they had already provided the Bureau with the following:", "i. Copies of their existing agency agreements for the sale of e-books;", "ii. Information about their largest e-book customers in Canada (filed as part of the notification to the Commissioner that was filed under Part IX of the Act, in respect of the Penguin Random House joint venture);", "iii. Extensive information in response to an informal request for information made in connection with that joint venture;", "iv. Copies of more than 20,000 documents produced in response to a formal Supplementary Request for Information made in connection with the joint venture (which apparently led the Respondents to collect more than 300,000 documents, before eventually determining that only 20,000 were responsive to the request);", "v. Copies of approximately 290,000 documents that were submitted to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice [DOJ] in connection with the joint venture."], ["[63]", "The Respondents further noted that they had incurred more than $750,000 in professional fees (before applicable taxes) in responding to the Commissioner's prior requests for information."], ["[64]", "In response to the Respondents' request that the draft Order be amended to eliminate requests for information that had previously been provided, the Commissioner added paragraph 12 to the draft that was initially submitted to the Court. That paragraph states that the Respondents need not produce information that was provided to the Commissioner in respect of the Penguin Random House joint venture pursuant to subsections 114(1) (initial notification filing) and 114(2) (formal Supplementary Information Request) of the Act."], ["[65]", "Paragraph 12 of the draft Order complements paragraph 11, which provides that where a Respondent previously produced a record to the Commissioner, that Respondent is not required to produce a copy of the record, provided that the Respondent: (1) identifies the previously produced record or thing to the Commissioner's satisfaction, (2) makes and delivers a written return in which it agrees and confirms certain things, and (3) receives confirmation from the Commissioner that such records or things need not be produced. In addition, paragraph 11 states that where an affiliate of the Respondents, as identified in Schedule 1 to the Order, previously produced a record or thing to the Commissioner, the Respondents are not required to produce an additional copy of the record, provided that the Respondents comply with the three conditions above."], ["[66]", "I am satisfied that, taken together, paragraphs 12 and 11 appropriately address the Respondents' concerns regarding the potentially duplicate nature of the Order."], ["[67]", "With respect to the Respondents' submissions concerning the information previously provided in connection with the Commissioner's current inquiry, the Penguin Random House joint venture and the U.S. DOJ's investigation of essentially the same conduct that is the subject of the Commissioner's inquiry, I find the Commissioner's general position to be", "prima facie", "reasonable. In brief, the Commissioner states that such information is insufficient to determine the facts with respect to the current inquiry. Based on the description of that information above, the different purposes for which much of that information was provided, and the fact that the bulk of that information was provided to a regulatory authority in another country in relation to a different investigation, it is not obvious to me that it should suffice for the purposes of the Commissioner's inquiry into alleged conduct in Canada under sections 90.1, 76 and 79 of the Act."], ["[68]", "I recognize that the Respondents have already incurred significant time and expense in responding to the various prior information requests from the Commissioner described above. However, this alone does not provide a sufficient justification for the Court to decline to exercise its discretion to issue the Revised Draft Order ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 92). To warrant the exercise of such discretion in the Respondents' favour for this reason, the Court would have to be satisfied that the past burden incurred by the Respondents, together with the additional time and expense that will be associated with responding to the Order that I have issued, will be excessive, disproportionate or unnecessarily burdensome."], ["[69]", "In their correspondence to the Commissioner dated February 25, 2014, the Respondents acknowledged that the Revised Draft Order had satisfactorily addressed a number of the concerns that they had previously expressed. However, they maintained that other concerns remained unaddressed. Those concerns, together with the substantive issues discussed in the next section below, were the focus of their oral submissions in the hearing before me the following day. The remaining concerns of the Respondents can be summarized as follows."], ["[70]", "To begin, they maintained that the Revised Draft Order should be restricted to", "trade", "e-books, and should not extend to", "educational", "e-books. They based this position on their understanding that the inquiry does not relate to the latter type of e-books, and on the fact that Pearson Canada has published only educational books since it transferred its trade book business to Penguin Canada, in July 2013. They added that the definition of the broader category of all trade books should be limited to general interest fiction and non-fiction books, as was done in the U.S. Complaint discussed in Part I of these reasons above."], ["[71]", "While the Commissioner confined many of the Specifications in the Revised Draft Order to trade books (as defined therein), certain other Specifications were not so confined. These included the \"data\" Specifications set forth in Specifications 11, 12 and 13 of Schedule II. Specification 11 relates to all books, including print and audio books, while Specification 12 relates to all e-books. Specification 13 then requests much of the same information as described in Specification 12, for each print book and audio book within the scope of Specification 11."], ["[72]", "After I expressed some sympathy during the hearing of this application with the Respondents' position in relation to Specification 13, the Commissioner confined that Specification to trade print books and trade audio books. In addition, the Commissioner narrowed the definition of those types of books in the final Order."], ["[73]", "In my view, the Commissioner's refusal to confine the final draft Order, including the Specifications mentioned above, to trade e-books is not unreasonable. I accept the Commissioner's explanation that the information and records being requested under the final draft Order with respect to print, audio and educational books may well be relevant to, and assist in, the assessment of the competitive effects of the alleged anti-competitive conduct in relation to trade e-books. For example, if the analysis of all of this information revealed that the prices of print and audio books, including educational books, did not increase to the same degree as the prices of trade e-books in the period following the implementation of the conduct under inquiry, that could assist the Commissioner to establish that such conduct has substantially lessened competition, or is likely to do so."], ["[74]", "I also accept the Commissioner's position that even though Pearson Canada transferred its trade book business to Penguin Canada in July 2013, it may have information relevant to the inquiry, including information of the type described in the above-mentioned Specifications, for several reasons. These include the fact that it was engaged in the distribution and sale of trade books (including e-books) prior to that transfer, it has entered into agreements with e-book retailers for the distribution and sale of e-books, it continues to be engaged in the book publishing business generally, and it is an affiliate of Penguin Canada. If Pearson Canada no longer has certain categories of information because they have been transferred to Penguin Canada, it simply has to explain that fact in accordance with the terms of the final Order."], ["[75]", "This reasoning also applies with respect to the Respondents' submission that the Relevant Period should not include any periods after July 1, 2013, the date upon which (i) Pearson Canada contributed its trade book assets to Penguin Canada, and (ii) Penguin Canada was contributed to the Penguin Random House joint venture. I acknowledge the Respondents' assertion that the Senior Officers of the joint venture are different than those of the Respondents, and that Random House Canada has never been subject to any inquiry with respect to an alleged agreement for the sale of e-books. However, I do not accept their position that the documents and records of the joint venture could not be relevant to the Commissioner's inquiry, and that having to provide documents after July 1, 2013 from the joint venture would be disproportionately burdensome on Penguin."], ["[76]", "In addition, the Respondents submitted that the \"Relevant Period,\" as defined in the Order, should not include any periods prior to 2010, because (i) Penguin Canada and its predecessor did not sell any e-books to retailers prior to 2010; (ii) e-book readers were not sold in Canada until very late in 2009, and even then likely not in any material volumes until much later; and (iii) the Commissioner's affidavit only claims to have \"reason to believe that Penguin has engaged in this conduct since approximately 2011.\""], ["[77]", "In my view, it is not unreasonable for the Commissioner to seek information dating back to September 2009. According to the Complaint filed by the USA, that is approximately when the initial discussions took place between and among Apple and the U.S. Publisher Defendants, including Penguin US. I am satisfied that it is relevant for the Commissioner to see copies of the communications, records and other information described in the final Order dating back to that period. Among other things, this will assist the Commissioner to understand the business context in which the alleged conduct in Canada occurred, its underlying rationale, the extent to which that conduct changed relative to prior conduct and the impact that the conduct had, relative to the state of affairs immediately prior to that conduct, i.e., in the fall of 2009 and over the course of 2010."], ["[78]", "The Respondents further submitted that the Relevant Period described in the Order should not include any periods after May 17, 2013, the date of the U.S. Final Judgment. In this regard, they asserted that, pursuant to that Final Judgment, Penguin Canada and its predecessor have been legally prohibited from entering into or enforcing any agreement or arrangement with any other e-book publisher relating to prices or conditions of sale for e-books since that date."], ["[79]", "In my view, the fact that a respondent or an affiliate of a respondent to an application made under section 11 may have entered into a resolution in another jurisdiction with respect to conduct that is similar to conduct that is the subject of an inquiry under the Act does not axiomatically imply that documents and records post-dating such resolution cannot be relevant to the Commissioner's inquiry. To fully understand the nature and impact of the conduct in question, it will often be necessary to compare a respondent's behaviour and policies during the period in which conduct contrary to the Act is believed to have occurred, with the respondent's behaviour and policies during a reasonable period of time both before and after that period."], ["[80]", "Finally, the Respondents took the position that Specification 11 of the Order should not require information with respect to all books that they offered for sale during the Relevant Period, but rather should be confined to books that they actually sold. In support of this position, they stated that, in any given month, there are thousands of older books that Penguin Canada maintains for sale but does not actually sell. They added that it is not possible, or would be disproportionately burdensome to have to try to identify, books that were not sold in a given month. In addition, they stated that information in respect of books that were not sold during the Relevant Period cannot have any relevance to competition in Canada or the Commissioner's inquiry."], ["[81]", "After I expressed some sympathy with the Respondents' position on this point during the hearing of this application, the Commissioner revised Specification 11 to exclude those", "print", "and", "audio", "books that were not sold at any point during the Relevant Period. In my view, this was a reasonable and sufficient response, particularly given that the focus of the Respondents' oral submissions in respect of this matter appeared to be upon older print and audio books. Given that the focus of the Commissioner's inquiry is upon e-books, information and records with respect to those books, including e-books that were not actually sold during the Relevant Period, may very well be relevant to the inquiry. Indeed, it is not immediately apparent why information and records with respect to quantities of the relevant products sold and not sold during the relevant period of an inquiry would not be relevant to the inquiry.", "C.", "Issues concerning the substantive merits"], ["[82]", "In their correspondence to the Commissioner and during the oral hearing on this application, the Respondents vigorously asserted that as a result of the Consent Agreement filed with the Tribunal, the Commissioner can no longer have any plausible basis for any ongoing concern that conduct engaged in by them could lessen competition substantially, as contemplated by section 90.1 of the Act."], ["[83]", "In support of their position, the Respondents noted that each of the other major book publishers in Canada are parties to the Consent Agreement. They added that a term in the Consent Agreement states that where that agreement imposes an obligation on a respondent party to the agreement to engage in or to refrain from engaging in certain conduct, that obligation shall apply to any joint venture or other business arrangement established by that respondent and any of Penguin (USA), Inc., Pearson Canada or Penguin Canada, or their subsidiaries, successors and assigns. Accordingly, they asserted that the Consent Agreement expressly, and as a matter of fact, negates or precludes the possibility of an agreement described by section 90.1 of the Act, because neither Pearson Canada nor Penguin Canada can be party to an agreement with any competitor with a sufficient market presence to be able to agree to behave in a manner that prevents or lessens competition substantially. They maintain that this position is reinforced by the press release issued by the Bureau in respect of the Consent Agreement. Among other things, that press release states that the Bureau \"expects that competition among retailers will increase, resulting in lower prices for e-books,\" as a consequence of the Consent Agreement."], ["[84]", "Based on the foregoing, the Respondents submitted that the Commissioner cannot have \"reason to believe\" that grounds exist for the making of an order under Part VII.1 or Part VIII of the Act, within the meaning of paragraph 10(1)(", ")(ii), and that therefore the Court should exercise its discretion to decline to issue the Order sought by the Commissioner. They made a similar submission based on their assertion that the U.S. Final Judgment is (i) binding upon the Penguin Random House joint venture, of which Penguin Canada forms a part, and (ii) prohibits Penguin Canada from entering into or enforcing any agreement or arrangement with any other e-book publisher to raise, stabilize, fix, set or coordinate the retail price or wholesale price of any e-book, or to fix, set or coordinate any term or condition relating to the sale of e-books since May 17, 2013. They added that the fact that the Penguin Random House joint venture was ultimately cleared by the Commissioner reinforces their position that the Commissioner cannot have \"reason to believe\" that the grounds described above exist."], ["[85]", "In response, the Commissioner maintained that the Respondents entered into one or more agreements contrary to s. 90.1 and that pursuant to that or those agreement(s), they switched from their prior wholesale agreements with retailers to agency agreements that have and will continue to impose anti-competitive restrictions on retailers. The Commissioner also noted that the term in the Consent Agreement which imposes obligations on the Settling Publishers with respect to Penguin Canada and Pearson Canada pertains to", "future", "joint ventures or other business arrangements between the Respondents and any of the Settling Publishers. The Commissioner submitted that, notwithstanding this provision, the Respondents can continue to engage in unilateral discussions with e-book retailers while still acting further to the anti-competitive agreement that the Commissioner alleges was entered between the Respondents and the Settling Publishers. In response to questioning during the hearing of this application, the Commissioner stated that there is nothing in the Consent Agreement that prohibits the Settling Publishers from being a party to the agreement that is the subject of the inquiry being conducted pursuant to section 90.1, or that requires the Settling Publishers to withdraw from any such agreement."], ["[86]", "By their plain and explicit terms, each of the obligations imposed on the Settling Publishers under Part II of the Consent Agreement pertains to agreements or arrangements between a Settling Publisher and an e-book retailer, or to retaliatory conduct by the former towards the latter. In contrast to the U.S. Final Judgment, there does not appear to be any provision in the Consent Agreement that expressly prohibits a publisher from entering into or enforcing an agreement or other arrangement with another publisher to fix, set or coordinate the retail or wholesale price of any e-book, or to fix, set or coordinate any term or condition relating to the sale of e-books."], ["[87]", "Accordingly, I am not satisfied that it is as axiomatic as the Respondents suggest that the Consent Agreement precludes or negates any possibility of an agreement described by section 90.1. The same applies with even greater force to the fact that the Penguin Random House joint venture was cleared, as that arrangement only involved the parties to the joint venture, whereas the agreement that is the subject of the inquiry under section 90.1 includes other leading participants in the publishing business in Canada."], ["[88]", "I am also not satisfied that it is unlikely that the Commissioner's inquiry could discover information to demonstrate, as a matter of fact, the existence of an agreement described by section 90.1, to which one or both of the Respondents are a party. I note that the Respondents did not lead any evidence on either of these points."], ["[89]", "More fundamentally, a section 11 application is not the appropriate forum for the Court to make final determinations regarding issues related to theories of competitive effects, defences, exemptions or the factual likelihood that an inquiry may disclose the existence of information demonstrating the existence of conduct described in section 90.1 or another provision in Part VIII of the Act (", "Air Canada", ", above, at para 21;", "CP Containers (Bermuda) Ltd (Re)", ", 1995 CarswellNat 2899, 64 CPR (3d) 384, at para 6)."], ["[90]", "A section 11 application is made during the investigatory phase of the administration and enforcement of the Act by the Commissioner. The purpose of such investigations is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant an application to the Tribunal (in the case of inquiries under Part VII.1 or Part VIII of the Act) or a referral to the Director of Public Prosecutions (in the case of an inquiry under Part VI or Part VII). Absent evidence of bad faith or the existence of other exceptional circumstances, which I have difficulty identifying at this point in time, the Court should refrain from making determinations at this fact finding stage which essentially reach final conclusions regarding the substantive merits of an inquiry (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 87)."], ["[91]", "This applies equally to the Respondents' position with respect to subsection 76(4) of the Act, which provides, among other things, that no order may be made under subsection 76(2) where the respondent supplier and the customer are principal and agent.", "D.", "The role of respondents"], ["[92]", "Pursuant to the express terms of section 11, applications are to be made on an", "ex parte", "basis.

Finally, the applicant alleges that given his age and physical condition he cannot live in security in any part of the country."], ["[11]", "The officer then articulated the background information of the applicant as she understood the facts. It was stated that when the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) left the country, the Tamil Tigers began to harass the applicant's daughters after 1990 to finance the LTTE group. In 1995, the family left for Mankulam in the Vanni region because the Singhalese army was advancing on Jaffna. The Tamil Tigers harassed his daughters to enlist, but the applicant and his wife resisted and returned to Kopay in 2000."], ["[12]", "The officer went on to state that the army suspected one of the applicant's daughters of having ties to the Tamil Tigers and periodically detained her. The soldiers allegedly arrested the applicant from time to time for questioning and then would subsequently release him. In February 2002, the applicant was released at the village chief's and priest's behest after the army allegedly discovered weapons on the farm of the applicant. Subsequently, it was alleged that his wife was hit by members of the military who were looking for him. Immediately afterwards, the applicant went to Colombo and left the country with the help of a smuggler."], ["[13]", "The officer also mentions that the applicant's family was not affected by the December 26, 2004 tsunami that devastated the coast of Sri Lanka, including the Jaffna region, in north Kopay where the applicant is from."], ["[14]", "The officer found that the applicant submitted new evidence with his PRRA application and HC-1 application. The new evidence consisted of documents from the US Department of State Human Rights Practices, Human Rights Watch, WebAmnesty, and UNHCR, and articles from the Sri Lankan press, Journal de Montreal, The Gazette and the tamilnet.com website. The officer evaluated these documents as well as other more up-to-date documents that were not detailed in order to understand the current risks in Sri Lanka."], ["[15]", "The officer then reviewed the elements necessary for finding that a risk existed for the applicant under the Act and from the 1951", "Convention related to the Status of Refugees", "and Article 1 of the", "Convention Against Torture"], ["[16]", "The officer stated that she attached importance to the IRB's reasons for denying protection in rendering her own decision and pointed to contradictions the panel found in the applicant's statements and how these inconsistencies were found to undermine his credibility."], ["[17]", "The officer found that the applicant reiterated the same risks in his PRRA application as were alleged before the IRB but added that there was new evidence that the current situation in his country was unstable and dangerous and this was evaluated to find whether this would put the applicant's life and safety at risk if he returned."], ["[18]", "The officer stated that the salient issue before her was the applicant's personal profile and the situation of the country, and not the evidence already judged by the IRB.

The officer writes that the general situation deteriorated in the past two years from when the RPD decision was written."], ["[21]", "The officer specifically addressed the Report of the High Commissioner for Refugees dated December 2006. According to the reading of the report by the officer, individuals targeted for extortion by the LTTE are business people and those with large incomes. The officer states that the report also confirms that the conflict is located in the north and east of the country which the applicant does not have to go to upon returning to Sri Lanka."], ["[22]", "The officer states, however, that she consulted more up-to-date sources than the report. Specifically, the officer mentions a September 2007 report by the Norwegian Refugee Council - (IDMC) (Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre) which locates displaced civilians in the east and north of the country. The officer goes on to state that in the Colombo region, there are no displaced persons and there is an office of the High Commissioner for Refugees. The officer concludes that the applicant could live in security in Colombo or in the regions under the control of the Singhalese authorities. The officer goes on to state that, the same report states that several Tamils who were arrested in Colombo and returned by bus to the north of the country were returned following a decision of the Supreme Court."], ["[23]", "The officer also looks at the process upon returning to Sri Lanka and states that there is a process in place for Tamils returning to Sri Lanka: foreign nationals are questioned upon their return and once their identity is confirmed, and they are found not to have a criminal record, they are released."], ["[24]", "In conclusion, the officer finds that the applicant \"has not presented sufficient evidence to prove that he would be personally targeted on his return, that he would be unable to avail himself of protection or that there is no internal flight alternative in Sri Lanka\". As a result, the officer said \"there exists no more than a mere possibility that the applicant would be persecuted on his return to his country\" and \"no serious grounds to believe that the applicant would be subject to torture, a threat to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment of punishment on his return to Sri Lanka.\"", "Issues"], ["[25]", "The applicants submitted the following issues for consideration:", "1.

A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes.

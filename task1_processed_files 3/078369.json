This Court has already many times undertaken the exercise of determining, with the aid of a pragmatic and functional analysis, the standard applicable to similar decisions by the Commission. In particular, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 175 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.) (at paragraphs 47 to 57), my colleague Mr. Justice François Lemieux, after analyzing the relevant case law in detail, held that the standard of review applicable to Commission decisions made pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(d) of the", "CHRA", "was reasonableness or correctness, depending on the nature of the error alleged (", "Brine", ", supra, at paragraph 57, citing", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 81 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "More recently, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  my colleague Madam Justice Elizabeth Heneghan carried out a full pragmatic and functional analysis to determine the standard of review applicable to Commission decisions made pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(e) of the", "CHRA", ". I will therefore take the liberty of adopting the gist of my colleague's analysis, being careful to adjust the factor of the analysis concerning the nature of the point at issue in the case of paragraph 41(1)(d).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "With respect to decisions made pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(e), Heneghan, J., held that the applicable standard of review was that of patent unreasonableness (", "Price", ", supra, at paragraph 42). However,", "CHRA", "paragraphs 41(1)(d) and (e) involve decisions that are very different in terms of the degree of discretion exercised by the Commission. Specifically, a decision made pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(e) requires a ruling only on whether the complaint was filed within the specified deadline and whether the deadline in question should be extended: this is simply a question of fact. A decision made pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(d), on the other hand, calls more upon the Commission's exercise of jurisdiction in that the Commission is required to decide whether or not to deal with a complaint. It is then making a decision not merely on a procedural issue (deadline compliance), but on a substantive issue (the exercise of its jurisdiction in connection with the basis of the complaint). The factor of the pragmatic and functional analysis of the nature of the point at issue thus produces a different result in the case of paragraph 41(1)(d), since it allows a more flexible standard of review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "Apart from that clarification, I agree with Heneghan, J., that, although the", "CHRA", "contains no privative clause, the discretionary nature of the review mechanism set out in subsection 41(1) requires a certain degree of restraint (", "Price", ", supra, at paragraph 39). Further, the Commission has a measure of expertise as the trier of fact (", "Price", ", supra, at paragraph 41), but conversely, its decisions which, as in the case at bar, concern the exercise of its jurisdiction, will be subject to a more flexible standard of review. Finally, although the", "CHRA", "has a public interest impact, the purpose of paragraph 41(1)(d) is primarily the resolution of disputes between two parties, which also favours a more flexible standard of review. For these reasons, I find that the standard of review applicable to the Commission's decision not to deal with a complaint based on paragraph 41(1)(d) of the", "CHRA", "is that of reasonableness.

Further, it is clear that the investigator did not base her investigation solely on the decision by the grievance adjudicator, since her report showed that she had also considered the applicant's allegations having to do with his alcohol dependence and the question of reasonable accommodation. In particular, she noted that the applicant had failed to submit sufficient evidence to the grievance adjudicator regarding his condition, even though he had the opportunity to do so.

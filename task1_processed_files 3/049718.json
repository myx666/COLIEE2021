Her parents took steps to hide the pregnancy and the Applicant was born on July 20, 2002. The day after the Applicant's birth her parents arranged for her to be cared for by a family in a remote village where she stayed until she was 18 months old. Her mother then took her to live with her maternal grandparents. When she was three years old her paternal grandparents took over her care.

They were also afraid that her birth would be discovered by the Chinese government if they made the declaration. Nor did they declare the Applicant as a dependant when they arrived in Canada in July 2006. Soon after they landed they applied to sponsor the Applicant so that she could join them in Canada.

The family has visited the Applicant on several occasions. They returned to China to be with her, staying there from 2009 to 2011.

The Visa Officer stated that the Applicant's parents had been informed on January 10, 2006, through the visa pick up letter, of the importance of advising the visa office of any changes to their family status before collecting their visas. Further, because of the moderate English proficiency of the Applicant's mother, it was implausible that she was unaware of this instruction.

While the Applicant's parents asserted that not granting H&C relief would tear the family apart, the family is voluntarily living in China. Thus, there was no need for H&C relief.

As to the family reunification objectives of the IRPA, this contention fails because the family is residing as a whole in China, family unity is therefore not at issue.

Where the child too is subject to the removal order, the officer must also assess the hardship the child will suffer in being removed with the parents. Where the child has status to remain in Canada, as was the case in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , but not the case here, the officer is also to consider the hardship if the child leaves with the parents.", "In any case, the issue for the officer is to assess the degree of hardship to the child and weigh that hardship against the other relevant factors, the ultimate goal being to determine what is in the best interests of that child.

He concluded that since the Applicant had a birth certificate, there was no impediment to registering her hukou. Therefore, there was insufficient evidence to show that there was an impediment to her education. The Visa Officer also stated that there was insufficient evidence to show that the Applicant would suffer unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship as a result of her separation from her family, that there was no impediment to her family reuniting with her in China, and, there was no evidence that the Applicant could not continue living with her relatives in China."], ["[29]", "However, there was evidence on the record which appears to clearly contradict the Visa Officer's findings and resultant conclusions.

The Applicant's father's evidence directly contradicted the Visa Officer's conclusions that the Applicant could register for her hukou, that there were no impediments to the family living together in China, and, that there was no evidence that the Applicant could not continue living with her relatives in China. It also described the family's intention to return to Canada, to join the Applicant's father here, and to live here permanently. The letter from the Applicant's sister, Angela, explained that she was struggling to adjust to life in China, her wish to return to Canada to attend high school but that she could not do so alone, and, spoke to the difficulties of having a divided family. The Visa Officer also did not refer to the letters from the Applicant and her mother."], ["[30]", "As the Visa Officer entirely failed to engage with this evidence, the decision is unreasonable on this basis (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It is also of note that the Citizenship and Immigration Canada manual OP-4", "Processing of Applications under section 25 of IRPA", "emphasizes that officers should consider all evidence related to the best interests of the child adduced on an H&C application."], ["[31]", "In my view, the Visa Officer also failed to address the best interests of the Applicant's siblings. The jurisprudence of this Court concerning children otherwise excluded from the family class by s. 117(9)(d) of the IRPA Regulations suggests that the Visa Officer must consider the scenario of the family being reunited in Canada when considering the best interests of the child (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 20). In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 21, Justice Heneghan pointed out that one of the IRPA's objectives, as found in s. 3(1)(d) of the IRPA, is family reunification in Canada. Therefore, in that case, where the child was excluded by the operation of s. 117(9)(d) of the IRPA Regulations, the Visa Officer should have addressed the possibility of the Applicant child and her parents being reunited in Canada ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 18-22). These decisions are consistent with <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, where the Federal Court of Appeal dealt with a child excluded by s. 117(9)(d) and indicated that an officer must determine whether the child's best interests, when weighed against other H&C factors, should allow them to enter Canada ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 38)."], ["[32]", "Further, where more than one child is directly affected, the officer must consider their separate interests and needs (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Here, the Applicant's siblings are both Canadian children and, in my view, were directly affected by their sister's presence in China. As Canadian citizens being forced to move back to China with their parents, their situation was very different from that of their sister. They are dependent children, aged roughly 14 and 6, and cannot relocate to Canada at any time, as the Respondent suggests. Angela had lived most of her formative years in Canada. The evidence indicated that Angela was struggling in China, she wished to return to Canada, and, that the separation from her sister was difficult on her and the family. However, the Visa Officer did not mention that evidence. Nor did the Visa Officer mention her brother, Bryan, in the decision. Nor is there evidence to support the Respondent's assertion that the Canadian children were familiar with the language and culture of China, in particular the youngest who was born in Canada. The evidence also does not support the Respondent's characterisation of the move of part of the family back to China as a voluntary and private decision."], ["[33]", "In my view the Visa Officer should have used the Applicant's potential life in Canada as a point of comparison in considering her best interests", "( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 41).

And, as noted above, the Visa Officer ignored or overlooked the evidence that supported key aspects of the Applicant's claim and then found that there was insufficient evidence of hardship. In my view, in these circumstances, as in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 36 and", "Sultana", ", above, the Visa Officer's fixation on this factor prevented him from genuinely assessing the H&C considerations that the Applicant had raised."], ["[36]", "The Visa Officer also found that the Applicant's mother's explanation as to why her parents failed to declare the Applicant at the airport on landing was implausible, being that her mother's moderate level of English was sufficient for her to have understood that she needed to declare the Applicant.

En outre, l'agent des visas a appliqué erronément le « critère des difficultés excessives » pour apprécier l'intérêt supérieur des enfants et il n'a pas examiné s'il était dans l'intérêt supérieur de la demanderesse de venir au Canada rejoindre sa famille, ou le droit des enfants canadiens de rester au Canada. Il n'a pas non plus examiné la preuve de la famille de la demanderesse ou les rapports relatifs aux droits de la personne à propos des difficultés auxquelles s'exposent les « enfants illégaux » en Chine.

En outre, bien que les parents ainsi que la sœur et le frère de la demanderesse préfèrent vivre au Canada, les parents ont pris la décision personnelle de retourner en Chine afin d'être plus proches de la demanderesse. Quoique ses parents aient affirmé que le fait de ne pas accorder une mesure spéciale pour CH déchirerait la famille, cette dernière vit de son plein gré en Chine, et il n'est donc pas nécessaire de prendre une telle mesure. En outre, l'agent des visas n'a pas conclu que la crainte qu'avaient les parents d'avoir enfreint la politique de l'enfant unique était digne de foi et, de ce fait, les circonstances ne justifiaient pas la levée de l'exclusion prévue par l'alinéa 117(9)", ")."], ["[18]", "Le défendeur soutient, notamment, que, bien que des difficultés injustifiées ne soient peut-être pas un critère qui convient pour apprécier des questions liées à l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, ce que le défendeur ne concède pas, de telles considérations doivent répondre à un certain seuil de difficulté pour qu'il soit justifié de prendre une mesure spéciale. Quoi qu'il en soit, l'agent des visas a apprécié les difficultés auxquelles la demanderesse s'exposerait en Chine par rapport aux avantages dont elle pourrait bénéficier si elle obtenait la résidence permanente au Canada, ce qui montre donc qu'une analyse relative à l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant a été faite, comme la loi l'exige. Par ailleurs, l'agent des visas n'était pas tenu d'examiner s'il était dans l'intérêt supérieur de la demanderesse de venir au Canada, car celle-ci n'est pas citoyenne du Canada. La question est de savoir si les facteurs relatifs à l'intérêt supérieur militeraient en faveur de sa venue au Canada et si ces facteurs atteignent le seuil de difficulté qui convient pour justifier la prise d'une mesure spéciale CH.

Le défendeur fait valoir qu'on ne peut pas blâmer l'agent des visas pour avoir pris en considération la raison pour laquelle les parents avaient exclu la demanderesse de leur demande de résidence permanente, car cette raison est pertinente à l'égard du bien-fondé des difficultés excessives pour ce qui est de la légitimité de la décision et du fait de savoir si la décision de le faire résultait de facteurs indépendants de la volonté de la demanderesse. Quand aux objectifs de réunification familiale de la LIPR, cet argument est rejeté, car la famille tout entière réside en Chine, et la question de l'unité familiale n'est donc pas en litige.

En l'espèce, la sœur et le frère de la demanderesse sont tous deux Canadiens et, à mon avis, ils sont directement touchés par la présence de leur sœur en Chine. En tant que citoyens canadiens contraints de retourner en Chine avec leurs parents, leur situation est nettement différente de celle de leur sœur. Ils sont des enfants à charge, âgés d'environ 14 ans et 6 ans, et ils ne peuvent pas déménager au Canada en tout temps, comme le sous-entend le défendeur. Angela a passé la majeure partie de ses années formatrices au Canada, et il ressort de la preuve qu'elle a des difficultés en Chine, qu'elle souhaite revenir au Canada et que le fait d'être séparée de sa sœur est difficile pour elle et sa famille. Mais l'agent des visas n'a pas mentionné cette preuve. Pas plus qu'il n'a mentionné son frère, Bryan, dans la décision. Il n'existe de plus aucune preuve qui étaye l'affirmation du défendeur selon laquelle les enfants canadiens connaissaient bien la langue et la culture chinoises, en particulier le cadet, qui était né au Canada.

Pour donner un sens à cette disposition, les agents d'immigration doivent non seulement répondre superficiellement aux facteurs d'ordre humanitaire invoqués par le demandeur, mais ils doivent bien les évaluer pour déterminer s'ils sont suffisants pour contrebalancer la disposition draconienne 117(9)d). Comme mon collège le juge Kelen a fait remarquer dans  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> « [...] si la fausse indication donnée par le demandeur constituait le seul facteur à considérer, le ministre n'aurait plus aucun pouvoir discrétionnaire en vertu de l'article 25 de la Loi ». Cette directive a effectivement été reconnue dans le Guide OP 4 sur le traitement des demandes à l'étranger, à l'annexe F, où l'on rappelle que l'agent doit s'assurer « que son évaluation CH ne fait pas qu'expliquer pourquoi le demandeur est visé au R117(9)d) pour tenir compte des facteurs favorables présentés par le demandeur à l'appui de sa demande de dispense de l'application du R117(9)d) »."], ["[35]", "L'agent des visas n'a pas eu tort de tenir compte des motifs de la non-divulgation lors de l'examen des CH, mais sa décision donne à penser que l'« élément déterminant » a été l'omission de déclarer un membre de la famille (", "Sultana", ", précitée, aux paragraphes 30 et 31). Plus de la moitié des motifs ne font qu'énumérer les faits expliquant pourquoi les parents de la demanderesse n'ont pas fait état de cette dernière dans leurs demandes.

À mon avis, dans ces circonstances, comme dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 36, et l'affaire", "Sultana", ", précitée, la fixation de l'agent des visas sur ce facteur l'a empêché d'apprécier véritablement les facteurs CH que la demanderesse avait invoqués."], ["[36]", "L'agent des visas a également conclu que l'explication de la mère de la demanderesse, quant à la raison pour laquelle ils avaient omis de déclarer leur fille à l'aéroport après leur atterrissage, était peu plausible, car la connaissance moyenne qu'avait la mère de l'anglais était suffisante pour avoir compris qu'elle se devait de le faire. Cela semble être une conclusion relative à la crédibilité qui, bien qu'elle ne soit pas décisive dans le cas présent, montre par ailleurs que l'agent des visas s'est concentré sur les motifs pour lesquels les parents n'avaient pas déclaré la demanderesse plutôt que sur des facteurs CH."], ["[37]", "Compte tenu de mes constatations qui précèdent ainsi que de la conclusion selon laquelle la décision est déraisonnable, il n'est nul besoin d'examiner les autres questions que les parties ont soulevées dans leurs observations.", "JUGEMENT"], ["[38]", "LA COUR STATUE", "1. la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie, et la décision est renvoyée à un autre agent des visas pour nouvel examen;", "2. aucune question de portée générale à certifier n'a été proposée ou ne se pose.", "[End of document]"]]}

They argue that the IAD did not properly consider this evidence and therefore unreasonably concluded that the need for Mr. Samad's presence by his father's side, to the point of preventing him from establishing himself in Canada for the entire period of 2006 to 2010, had not been established."], ["[25]", "I disagree. The IAD acknowledged the medical condition of Mr. Samad's father, but nevertheless found that, based to the evidence, the Applicants had not made the necessary efforts to settle in Canada in due course. In my view, it is clear from the IAD's decision that it considered the importance for Mr. Samad to be close to his family in Egypt during that time and found the factor of caring for a loved one to be a positive one in terms of determining whether special relief under section 28 was warranted."], ["[26]", "However, the IAD also found that the weight to be accorded to that factor was lessened by other factors such as the relatively low burden imposed by the Act on permanent residents in terms of residency obligation, the significance of the Applicants' non-compliance with their residency obligation, the foreseeability of the medical condition of Mr. Samad's father at the time the Applicants validated their visa by entering Canada the first time, and the fact that both Mr. Samad and Ms. Baligh could continue their daily activities and could keep working full-time at their respective jobs while caring for Mr. Samad's father."], ["[27]", "In particular, the IAD found that the Applicants chose to validate their visa in August 2006 while being fully aware that they would not be able to settle in Canada because of Mr. Samad's father's condition", "Furthermore, it found that they made no significant efforts to strengthen their ties with Canada or to spend more time in the country to meet their residency requirement before December 2010."], ["[28]", "Based on these factors, the IAD concluded that the medical condition of Mr. Samad's father only partially justified the Applicants belated efforts to settle in Canada."], ["[29]", "Again, it is not the Court's role to reassess the evidence", "reweigh the factors and substitute its own view of the evidence to that of the IAD.

Therefore, the fact that they planned to establish themselves permanently in Canada in the summer of 2010 is irrelevant to an analysis of the number of days they were physically present in Canada in accordance with section 28 of the Act, as this provision requires a strict counting of days of physical presence. Furthermore, even if the IAD had counted those additional months in its calculations, the Applicants would still be short of the required 730 days of physical presence during the relevant period."], ["[45]", "Second, the Applicants submit the IAD member erroneously stated that the Applicants missed the 730-day mark by one to two years. They argue that the IAD member should have taken into account the fact that the Applicants have permanently resided in Canada since they landed in Montréal in December, 2010 (for Mr Samad, June 2011). This argument, however, is flawed. The 730-day requirement is for the first five years before the examination, and not for the years following the examination but before the appeal hearing. Since the examination of December 26, 2010 occurred before the five-year mark, the relevant five-year time period was from August 6, 2006 to August 5, 2011. The Applicants had not been physically present in Canada for 730 days during this time period.

The Applicants submit that this error could have played a part in the IAD's decision-making. The Respondent argues that this mistake did not have a significant impact on the IAD's analysis of the evidence and the weighing of the positive and negative factors."], ["[47]", "When read as a whole, I find that this error is not determinative of the outcome of the case which was based on an assessment of whether there were sufficient H&C considerations to overcome the breach of the Applicants' residency obligation. It was for the Applicants to show that, if it was not for that mistake, the IAD's decision would have been favourable to them. I find nothing in the IAD's reasons that can reasonably lead to such conclusion. In other words, even without taking into consideration the suspension of removal orders to Egypt, it would have been reasonably open to the IAD to conclude from its H&C considerations analysis that the negative factors outweighed the positive factors in light of all the circumstances of the case."], ["[48]", "Thus, the \"further\" errors identified by the Applicants are immaterial to the case and therefore, they do not amount to reviewable errors."], ["[49]", "In sum, I find that the IAD conscientiously reviewed the evidence and that it conducted a thorough analysis, setting out the factors to consider and subsequently weighing the positive and the negative elements, before coming to the decision that there were insufficient H&C considerations to warrant special relief.

Ils soutiennent que le commissaire de la SAI aurait dû tenir compte du fait que les demandeurs résident de façon permanente au Canada depuis leur arrivée à Montréal en décembre 2010 (en juin 2011 pour M. Samad). Toutefois, cet argument n'est pas valable. L'obligation de résidence de 730 jours s'applique aux cinq premières années avant le contrôle, et non aux années suivant le contrôle mais précédant l'audience d'appel. Étant donné que le contrôle du 26 décembre 2010 a eu lieu avant la fin des cinq ans, la période de cinq ans pertinente était du 6 août 2006 au 5 août 2011.

Il appartenait aux demandeurs de démontrer que si ce n'était de cette erreur, ils auraient eu gain de cause devant la SAI.

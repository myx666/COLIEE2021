For example, the claimant was asked, between 1999 and November 2008, how many times he was attacked by skinheads; he replied many times. Then he indicated that he did not include all the times he was attacked. Asked if he was saying that they [sic] were other attacks by skinheads that he didn't mention his PIF narrative (instead of answering the question directly), he replied, ''What I wrote down is what I wrote down, and what I didn't, I didn't; the interpreter I had we just put in what we had time to put in.\" The panel finds his answer to what was simply a straightforward question to be evasive.", "The panel, however, repeated the question to which the claimant replied, \"Yes,\" He was then asked why he didn't write down all the attacks against him in his PIF narrative (the panel notes that he went back to being evasive); he replied, \"Whatever we wrote down is what we wrote down.\" But later he added that ''Whatever I remembered at that time we wrote down.\" The claimant was asked how many times he wrote (in his PIF narrative) that he was attacked; he replied, five times. The panel notes that his PIF narrative indicates that he was attacked seven times. Noting that in his oral testimony the claimant said he was attacked seven times, and in his PIF narrative the number of times he was attacked amount to seven times, but when he was asked how many times he wrote in his PIF narrative that he was attacked, he replied five times; the panel did not pursue an adverse credibility finding with respect to that discrepancy. The panel believes the claimant was credible with respect to the number of times he stated that he was attacked by skinheads in his PIF narrative which largely corresponded with the number of times in his oral testimony.", "However, the panel does not believe that he was indeed attacked and assaulted by any skinheads at any time, particularly as he now claimed that he was assaulted more times than he wrote in his PIF narrative", ". If indeed he was attacked by skinheads as he stated, especially more than the seven times over the nine year period (1999-2008) indicated in his Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative, on a balance of probabilities, he would not have been evasive in his response to the question when he was asked \"if he was saying that they [sic] were other attacks by skinheads that he didn't mention his PIF narrative.\" He would have simply answered the question directly.

In circumstances where the applicant may rely on a family of marks, as in the present case, the opponent's task to negate the distinctiveness of a newcomer to the applicant's family of marks is somewhat more difficult than in the ordinary case. In the present, the opponent's task is to demonstrate that its mark QUICKTAX became sufficiently known, in the three-year period from January 1993 to January 18, 1996, to negate the distinctiveness of the applied for mark", "in the context of the applicant's family of marks", ". I do not consider that the opponent's evidence of sales and advertising under its mark as submitted in this proceeding, without further details of how its mark QUICKTAX was exposed to the public over the three year period 1993 to 1996, is sufficient for that purpose. ...\"", "The Standard of Review on Appeal"], ["[22]", "With respect to an appeal of a decision of the Registrar of Trade-marks under s. 56 of the", "Act", ", the Federal Court of Appeal has recently emphasized that decisions of the Registrar should be afforded a significant degree of deference based on his relative expertise, particularly where no new evidence was adduced before the court.

Even though there is an express appeal provision in the Trade-marks Act to the Federal Court, expertise on the part of the Registrar has been recognized as requiring some deference. Having regard to the Registrar's expertise, in the absence of additional evidence adduced in the Trial Division, I am of the opinion that decisions of the Registrar, whether of fact, law or discretion, within his area of expertise, are to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness simpliciter. However, where additional evidence is adduced in the Trial Division that would have materially affected the Registrar's findings of fact or the exercise of his discretion, the Trial Division judge must come to his or her own conclusion as to the correctness of the Registrar's decision.\"", "Issues"], ["[23]", "The appellant raises the following issues:", "1) Did the Registrar err in finding that Quicklaw had established a \"family\" of trademarks? and", "2) Did the Registrar err in requiring the opponent to negate the distinctiveness of the applied for mark in the context of Quicklaw's family of marks?", "Submissions of the Parties", "\"Family\" of marks"], ["[24]", "Intuit relies on", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the proposition that a party asserting an existing \"family of marks\" must prove use of each mark in its family.

Quicklaw, in the trademark application, characterizes their wares as \"computer software\" and Ms. Simkins repeats this characterization in her affidavit. She was not cross-examined.

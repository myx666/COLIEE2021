For reasons that are not well-explained in the record, the hearing of their claims did not begin until June 29, 2004. The first day of the hearing was ended earlier than would have been the usual practice of the Board due to a previously-scheduled appointment of the Refugee Protection Officer (\"RPO\"). The resumption of the hearing was scheduled for September 28, 2004. When the Applicants, their counsel and the RPO presented themselves on that date, the panel did not appear. Subsequently, the Applicants were advised that the member was ill. Re-scheduling the second day of hearing was fraught with delays and confusion. In November 2004, when the resumption of the hearing was again threatened with postponement, the Applicants advised that they wished to accept the offer of the Board to start the hearing de novo after the Board had unilaterally cancelled a hearing date. Finally, the second day of hearing took place on November 30, 2004; this was a full day that extended beyond the usual sitting hours."], ["[5]", "The Applicant submits that, because of this \"improper treatment\" by the Board before and during the hearing process, they were not afforded a fair hearing. The Applicants also refer to \"abusive and sarcastic\" incidents of questioning by the Board. While they acknowledge that the questioning likely does not, in and of itself, amount to a breach of fairness, they argue that the cumulative effect of the procedural difficulties and the abusive questioning is a breach of procedural fairness."], ["[6]", "To begin this analysis, I do not agree with the Applicants that the manner of questioning should be considered cumulatively with the other administrative problems experienced by them in the processing of their claims. There is no link, in my mind, between the scheduling difficulties and the manner of questioning in the hearing. Other than her illness on September 28, 2004 - which was not within her control - there is no evidence that this particular panel of the Board was the cause of the scheduling disruptions or that this panel acted in bad faith in the hearing process."], ["[7]", "With respect to the manner of questioning during the hearing, based on my review of the transcript, the questioning by the Board comes nowhere near satisfying the test for a reasonable apprehension of bias. That test, paraphrased from the widely-accepted views of Justice de Grandpr√© in Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 394, is whether an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - would conclude that it is more likely than not that the Board, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly. It is true that the transcript contains a few examples of comments that, taken in isolation, appear to be sharply-worded. However, when read in context, each of these incidents can be explained on the basis of the complexity of the proceeding, the desire of the Board to clarify seemingly inconsistent testimony or the efforts of the Board to manage a complex proceeding with six applicants (five of whom testified). Even the Applicants acknowledge that the manner of questioning does not approach that criticized by the Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The actions of the Board in its questioning, in this case, do not demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of bias."], ["[8]", "This leaves, for consideration, the arguments that the hearing process in this case was so poorly managed that the Applicants were treated unfairly. In my view, to constitute grounds for overturning a decision, a lack of fairness must be identifiable in terms of the negative impacts on or prejudice to the affected person. For example, a failure to allow a claimant to present his evidence may be a breach of a claimant's right to be heard and, thus, a breach of procedural fairness. Delays in a proceeding which result in the disappearance of witnesses or an impairment of memory that occurs with time may be sufficient to show a breach of procedural fairness. Each case must be examined on its merits and, in each case, there must be a connection between the mistreatment and prejudice to the Applicants."], ["[9]", "In the application before me, the Applicants have not demonstrated that there is a link between the decision rendered by the Board in their case and the alleged lack of integrity in the Board's processing of their claims. There is no evidence that the decision or the hearing was affected by the flawed procedures. The Applicants do not argue, for example, that evidence was improperly excluded, that they were not permitted to submit documentary evidence, or that certain family members were not allowed to testify. Any of these actions could reasonably be expected to cause prejudice to the Applicants."], ["[10]", "In this case, the treatment of the Applicants by the employees of the Board appears to have been deplorable. For long periods of time, there was no communication. The hearing was unilaterally re-scheduled on short notice.

The doctrine of abuse of process is not limited to acts giving rise to an unfair hearing; there may be cases of abuse of process for other than evidentiary reasons brought about by delay.", "It must however be emphasized that few lengthy delays will meet this threshold. I caution that in cases where there is no prejudice to hearing fairness, the delay must be clearly unacceptable and have directly caused a significant prejudice to amount to an abuse of process.

The problems of the Applicants were specific to their case - a complicated case involving many different interests - and do not exemplify a systemic breakdown of the Board's normal procedures.

The Applicant son-in-law left Colombia on December 24, 1998 for the United States, where he became the subject of a visa sponsorship application initiated by his grandparents. At the time that the Applicant son-in-law entered Canada from the United States, he was in the process of applying for a U.S. visa. On April 27, 2001, he came to Canada to visit Catalina, whom he had met in the United States. When he attempted to return to the United States on April 29, 2001, the US INS discovered that he had been illegally working in the United States. He chose to remain in Canada when U.S. border officials advised that he would be placed in detention if he entered the United States. The Applicant son-in-law claimed refugee status on April 30, 2001 on the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  from the FARC. He is now married to Catalina.", "Board's Findings on the Applicant Son-in-law's Claim"], ["[16]", "In rejecting the Applicant son-in-law's claim, the Board was not persuaded that the FARC had any interest in him.

The Board also stated that it lacked \"credible evidence that the shots fired at the restaurant were meant for [the Applicant son-in-law], given the lack of any follow up [by the FARC] during the four months following that incident\". In addition, the Board found that the Applicant son-in-law's travel to Canada from the United States, while his visa application was outstanding, \"does not indicate a subjective fear of persecution.\""], ["[17]", "In sum, the Board was not persuaded that the Applicant son-in-law had a well-founded fear of persecution by the FARC. Further, the Board questioned his subjective fear on the basis that the son-in-law had put his visa status in the United States at risk by visiting Catalina in Canada. The Board found that this behaviour belied the Applicant son-in-law's claim of a subjective fear of persecution.", "Applicant son-in-law's Visit to Canada from the United States"], ["[18]", "The Applicants contend the Board erred in finding that the Applicant son-in-law's choice to visit Canada was inconsistent with a subjective fear of persecution for the reason that it put his U.S. visa at risk. The Applicants submit that the Board ignored evidence put forth by the son-in-law that he thought he would not run into any problems."], ["[19]", "The Applicants are correct that there are no specific references in the Board's reasons to the explanation given by the son-in-law that a friend had been able to visit without difficulty. Given the length of time that the son-in-law had been in the United States and his evident knowledge of U.S. immigration rules and regulations, the Board's conclusion is not, in my view, unreasonable. Nevertheless, it would have been preferable for the Board to explicitly refer to the explanation and explain why it was rejected. However, in this case, any error by the Board on this question is immaterial. This is because the Board's decision rests primarily on its conclusion that the son-in-law failed to convince the Board of the basis of his claim. Any conclusion related to the son-in-law's reasons for coming to Canada is supportive - but not determinative - of the Board's decision. There is no reviewable error.", "Generalized risk"], ["[20]", "In making his claim to the Board, the Applicant son-in-law asserted a fear on behalf of himself and his young Canadian-born son, should they return to Colombia.

Concerning the impact on the son-in-law caused by having a young child with him  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Board stated:", "Counsel suggested, in her submissions, that it would be indirect cruel and unusual treatment/punishment for [the son-in-law] to have to return to Colombia because of the psychological stress that would be on him as a parent worrying about the welfare of his son. The panel finds that the risk of this is a general risk faced by all parents  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  based on the on-going civil war, and that there is no evidence before it that [the son-in-law] faces a risk greater than all parents there."], ["[21]", "The Applicants submit that the Board erred in applying the test under s. 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 which requires that, for a person to be in need of protection, they face a risk that is \"not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\" In their submission, the Board erred by equating the phrase \"faced generally by other individuals\" with \"faced generally by all parents.\" In support, the Applicants cite a decision of the Board where the Board found a claimant couple was at risk of cruel and unusual treatment because of the risk of their children being kidnapped (I.D.Q. (Re), (2002) R.P.D.D. No. 189)."], ["[22]", "I first note that the Board, in the paragraph concluding this section of their Reasons, states its finding that the risk of the son-in-law \"is no greater than or different to the general risk faced by all persons in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\" From this, it appears that the Board understood the correct test. The question is whether a risk to a sub-group - in this case, parents - can be a risk contemplated by s. 97(1)(b)(ii). The Board evidently believed that it is. The question before me is whether this extension of the concept of \"faced generally\" was correct or reasonable. In my view, it was."], ["[23]", "I do not find the case of I.D.Q., supra to be of assistance. In I.D.Q.,supra, the claimants were Colombian nationals who claimed a well-founded fear of persecution from FARC. The children, in that case, had been the victims of kidnapping attempts. The panel found that there was a serious possibility that the children would be kidnapped should they return to Mexico and continued on to find that, \"should any of the children be kidnapped and harmed, the adult claimants will likely suffer severe psychological trauma.\" On the basis of these two findings, the panel found that the children and the parents were persons in need of protection. The case before me is distinguishable from I.D.Q on its facts. The parents in that case were facing a specific and personal risk from the criminals who had attempted to kidnap their children."], ["[24]", "It seems to me that common sense must determine the meaning of s. 97(1)(b)(ii). To put the matter simply: if the Applicants are correct that parents  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  are a group facing a risk not faced generally by other individuals  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , then it follows that every Colombian national who is a parent and who comes to Canada is automatically a person in need or protection. This cannot be so."], ["[25]", "The risk described by the Applicants and the Board in this case is a risk faced by millions of Colombians; indeed, all Colombians who have or will have children are members of this population. It is difficult to define a broader or more general group within a nation than the group consisting of \"parents\"."], ["[26]", "Further, I can see nothing in s. 97(1)(b)(ii) that requires the Board to interpret \"generally\" as applying to all citizens. The word \"generally\" is commonly used to mean \"prevalent\" or \"widespread\". Parliament deliberately chose to include the word \"generally\" in s. 97(1)(b)(ii), thereby leaving to the Board the issue of deciding whether a particular group meets the definition. Provided that its conclusion is reasonable, as it is here, I see no need to intervene."], ["[27]", "In conclusion, the Board reasonably concluded that the risk to which the son-in-law and his wife would be subject is a general risk and does not make them persons in need of protection under s. 97.", "Issue #3: Did the Board err in its assessment of the Applicants' risk by failing to consider evidence of risks to businessmen  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ?"], ["[28]", "The Applicants assert that the Board committed a fatal error by not considering the risk to the Applicants based on the fact that the principal Applicant was the owner of a small business.

The Board assessed the possible risk to the Applicants in Bogot√° on the basis of the evidence presented by the principal Applicant. That evidence included an admission by the principal Applicant that he could find employment in Bogot√°. In other words, the principal Applicant's own testimony was that he would not necessarily own and operate his own construction business if he returned to Colombia and lived in Bogot√°. Even if the principal Applicant had been targeted in the past by the FARC as a businessman, the evidence before the Board supported its finding that he did not need to own his own business in order to practise his skills at interior construction.

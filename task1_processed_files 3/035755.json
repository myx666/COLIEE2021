Par conséquent, il n'était pas déraisonnable de conclure que le demandeur n'avait pas de petit ami nommé Kenneth et que l'affidavit de Kenneth Oputa (DCT, à la page 203) était un document frauduleux (DCT, à la page 295). En outre, il était également raisonnable de conclure que le demandeur n'avait pas été identifié par un ancien camarade de classe dans une boîte de nuit dans une grande ville par une personne qu'il n'avait pas vue depuis douze (12) ans.

In 1980, he was posted to the RCMP Musical Ride. Upon completion of the Musical Ride assignment, he was transferred to the Federal Policing Branch Headquarters in Ottawa and then to the Commercial Crime Section in Toronto.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "Mr. MacDonald applied for a disability pension, pursuant to section 32 of the", "Royal Canadian Mounted", "Police Superannuation Act", ", R.S.C. 1985, c. R-11 (the", "RCMPSA", "), claiming that his foot conditions (pes planus and plantar facilitis) as well as his nasal conditions (chronic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis) arose as a result of injury or aggravation directly connected with his service in the Musical Ride.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "In particular, Mr. MacDonald attributes his foot problems to riding boots, foot positioning while riding, dismounting (onto a concrete floor) and carrying heavy tack boxes while on tour. He traces his nasal conditions to an experience at the RCMP breeding ranch. Apparently, Mr. MacDonald sustained a severe reaction when he was tasked to pile hay inside a storage building. In subsequent years, the \"allergies\" worsened. Mr. MacDonald repeatedly used \"over the counter\" medications to ameliorate his breathing problems. Eventually, he developed polyps in his nasal passages. The polyps severely compromise his breathing and sense of smell. The foot conditions significantly limit his capacity to engage in physical activity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "Dr. Ian Dempsey examined Mr. MacDonald in 1997 and again in 2003. In correspondence, dated February 16, 2006, Dr. Dempsey describes the \"exposure to hay with high levels of airborne particulate matter\" as being a \"trigger\" for some of Mr. MacDonald's symptoms.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "In accordance with the statutory regime, the first-level decision with respect to claims of this nature is rendered by a first-level decision-maker, a ministerial delegate. The ministerial delegate denied the claim essentially on the basis that the service records did not substantiate the conclusion that the alleged disabilities were causally related to past RCMP service.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "Pursuant to section 18 of the", "Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act", ", S.C. 1995, c. 18 (the", "VRAB Act", "), Mr. MacDonald requested that an Entitlement Review Panel (ERP) review the ministerial delegate's decision. The ERP examined the evidence and determined, notwithstanding the medical reports, that pension entitlement was not indicated primarily for the reasons enunciated by the ministerial delegate, i.e., service records do \"not provide medical evidence to determine a causal relationship between factors associated with the applicant's RCMP service and the development of his claimed conditions in the post-discharge period\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "Under section 25 of the", "VRAB Act", ", Mr. MacDonald appealed the ERP's decision to the Board.

Or, perhaps it constitutes an observation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "In the \"introduction\" portion of its decision, the Board states that it has examined all of the testimony and documented evidence in addition to four exhibits, one of which is an excerpt from Mr. MacDonald's service records regarding physiotherapy treatments for right Achilles tendonitis in 1985 and 1986. There is no further reference to this evidence. It is clear that Mr. MacDonald considered the excerpt to be an important one with respect to substantiating his claim. It was open to the board to find otherwise. It does not do so.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "Instead, the Board states that it has taken everything into account and finds that \"the claim is not supported by the facts and the evidence available to the board\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (", "Whitehead", "), Mr. Justice Gibson, in addressing reasons of a similar nature, concluded that while the decision of the Board may have been reasonably open to it, its decision was not supportable on the basis of its reasons. Regarding the statement that it had \"carefully reviewed all the evidence\", Justice Gibson found that such \"proclamations are simply not good enough\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "In relation to the nasal conditions, the Board cites an excerpt from the medical opinion of Dr. Dempsey dated 18 January 2007 and then, without commenting on that evidence, proceeds to summarize the ERP's conclusion that there was no medical evidence to causally connect the factors associated with Mr. MacDonald's RCMP service and the development of the claimed conditions in the post discharge period. The Board then affirms the ERP decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "The hearing before the Board is a de novo hearing. There was new evidence before the Board that was not before the ERP. It is not apparent to me that the Board conducted its own assessment prior to affirming the decision of the ERP. Rather, it appears to have relied on the ERP assessment. Dr. Dempsey's opinion of January 18, 2007 is relevant to Mr. MacDonald's claim. Although the Board acknowledges its existence, it does not assess it.

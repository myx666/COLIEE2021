Therefore, it would be wrong to introduce into the assessment of whether the right has been breached any consideration of whether or not the accused actually suffered prejudice when being denied his or her s. 14 rights. The Charter in effect proclaims that being denied proper interpretation while the case is being advanced is in itself prejudicial and is a violation of s. 14. Actual resulting prejudice is a matter to be assessed and accommodated under s. 24(1) of the Charter when fashioning an appropriate and just remedy for the violation in question. In other words, the \"prejudice\" is in being denied the right to which one is entitled, nothing more."], ["[15]", "The Supreme Court does indicate at paragraph 11 of its Decision that it is speaking only of a Criminal law context.

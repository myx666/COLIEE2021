They allegedly fear that they will be persecuted in that country for being Shia Muslims. The Principal Applicant stated in her narrative that she had always experienced discrimination, but the harassment became more severe after she and her husband began hosting religious functions at their home. This culminated in an incident on March 19, 2012, when several masked men attacked her as she was returning from the market. The Principal Applicant said that she went into hiding after the police did nothing, and she remained in hiding until she was able to secure passage to Canada for herself and her daughter. They arrived in this country on December 28, 2012, and made refugee claims some two months later."], ["[3]", "Their claims were dismissed by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board [IRB] on October 11, 2013. The RPD found that the Principal Applicant was a poor witness. The Principal Applicant originally testified that the men who attacked her did not say they belonged to any organization; but then later she evasively testified that they belonged to the Tehreek e Tahafuz e Islam, which is the same as the Tehreek e Sipa e Muhammed. Neither of these organizations was identified in the Principal Applicant's basis of claim form, and the RPD doubted that she would omit such a central detail of her claim simply because she was frightened. The RPD thus decided that the Principal Applicant had not established that the agents of persecution were affiliated with any organization at all."], ["[4]", "As there was no organization pursuing her, the Principal Applicant was unable to convince the RPD that she had no internal flight alternative [IFA]. The RPD noted that Karachi was a large, populous city far away from where the Applicants had lived, and the random men who attacked the Principal Applicant would not likely be motivated or equipped to seek her out in Karachi. While there was some general sectarian violence everywhere in Pakistan, the RPD observed that there are between 9 and 38 million Shia Muslims in the country. According to the RPD, the documentary evidence did not support a finding that the scale of the violence was such that every Shia Muslim in Karachi faced more than a mere chance that they would be harmed. As well, there was insufficient evidence to persuade the RPD that the Applicants would be unable to practice their religion openly or that the Principal Applicant could not find employment. Thus, the RPD rejected the Applicants' claims."], ["[5]", "The Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] dismissed the Applicants' appeal and confirmed that they were not entitled to protection under either section 96 or subsection 97(1) of the", "Immigration and Refugee Protection Act", ", SC 2001, c 27 [", "Act", "].

Both the RPD's credibility assessment and its determination that Karachi was an IFA fell into that category, so the RAD applied the reasonableness standard of review."], ["[8]", "The RAD found that the Applicants' complaints about the RPD's credibility findings mischaracterized the RPD's decision. The RPD never made a global finding that the Principal Applicant was not credible, nor did it find that there were no extremist groups in Pakistan. Rather, the RPD impugned only the Principal Applicant's testimony that the men who attacked her belonged to an extremist group. The RAD endorsed that determination by the RPD, stating that:"], ["[36] ...If the Appellants are being targeted by an extremist group, the identity of that group is certainly very significant to their refugee claims. However, their BoC [Basis of Claim] forms do not name any extremist groups, nor did the principal Appellant do so in her initial testimony to the RPD. When pressed, she named a group that does not appear to be mentioned in the objective evidence, and then she gave a different name for the group, which is also conspicuous by its absence from country condition documents. The letters she provided do not name any group. In this context, it was reasonable for the RPD to make a negative credibility finding and to find that the Appellants had not established that the agents of persecution were affiliated with any extremist group."], ["[9]", "The RAD also found no fault with the RPD's IFA analysis. While there was some evidence that there was no IFA for people targeted by specific extremist groups, the RAD noted that there was no reason for the RPD to comment on that given the RPD's credibility findings. Rather, the RAD stated that only the general risks were relevant, and the RPD had reviewed the country conditions and made specific reference to the sectarian violence affecting Shia Muslims. The RAD opined (at paragraph 42 of its decision) that, while it \"might have considered the same evidence and reached a different conclusion, the RPD's decision is to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness.\" The RAD found that the RPD's decision regarding the situation of Shia Muslims in Karachi and the Applicants' ability to openly practice their religion satisfied the criteria set out in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED."], ["[10]", "Finally, the RAD was satisfied that the RPD had considered all the relevant factors set out in the", "Chairperson Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-related Persecution", "(13 November 1996), even though the RPD had not referred to them specifically in its reasons.

As noted by Mr. Justice Simon NoÃ«l in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, the case law diverges on this issue."], ["[12]", "Some decisions state that the correctness standard applies, either because the issue is one of central importance to the legal system and outside of the RAD's expertise, or because it affects the jurisdictional lines between the RPD and the RAD (e.g.", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED). Other cases disagree and say that it is no more than a question of interpreting the RAD's home statute, which presumptively attracts the reasonableness standard (REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). Questions on this issue have been certified in several of these cases and the appeal from", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "has now been scheduled for later this year, so this division in the case law will soon be considered by the Federal Court of Appeal."], ["[13]", "In the meantime, I agree with Mr. Justice Luc Martineau's pragmatic approach to the issue in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED. As he notes and as I summarize below, the case law is divided on the scope of review that the RAD should apply. This creates a problem similar to one this Court once faced with respect to the residency test for citizenship (REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). If the correctness standard is applied by every judge of this Court, the RAD could diligently follow one line of cases only to see its decisions set aside whenever they are reviewed by a judge who favours the other line of cases. The law requires more certainty than that. As the Federal Court of Appeal observed in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, \"the meaning of a law should not differ according to the identity of the decision-maker.\" The Federal Court cannot fix the problem at the RAD level so long as the judges of this Court disagree on the solution, and applying the correctness standard in this situation would undermine the rule of law even more than if the dispute was just at the RAD level (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED). For similar reasons, Justice Martineau concluded in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "that decisions of the RAD should be upheld so long as either of the two approaches currently accepted by the Court, or any other reasonable approach, is applied by the RAD (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[14]", "Adopting such an approach in this case, the RAD's decision in this case should be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness.

While the proceeding before the RAD is shaped by the RPD's decision, in the sense that those are the findings being challenged by an appellant, the Applicants submit it does not follow that the RAD must completely defer to those findings. The Applicants argue that the RAD could always convoke a hearing pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the", "Act", "if it is necessary to assess credibility. In this case, the IFA was determinative and that finding was based primarily on a review of the documentary evidence, so the Applicants contend that the RPD was in no better position to make that finding than the RAD would be."], ["[17]", "The Applicants further claim that the RAD's concern that the RPD is better placed to make credibility findings does not justify a deferential standard of review by the RAD. The Applicants say it is inappropriate and wasteful for the RAD to adopt administrative law standards of review and simply duplicate the function of the Federal Court. The standards of correctness and reasonableness were developed to govern the relationship between the executive and judicial branches of government, and the Applicants argue that different considerations apply when both the lower and higher tribunal belong to the executive branch (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). The Applicants point out that many decisions of this Court have set aside decisions of the RAD which have applied the reasonableness standard for similar reasons (citing e.g.", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[18]", "The Respondent submits that the RAD should review RPD decisions for palpable and overriding error (citing", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED). In its view, that conclusion is supported by the statutory scheme, the legislative history of the RAD, and the central role of the RPD in determining refugee claims and finding the facts. The Respondent points out that the RPD is the only tribunal to which all eligible refugee claims are referred, and it makes decisions on cessation and vacation of claims that will never go to the RAD."], ["[19]", "Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the", "Act", "expressly requires the RPD to conduct an oral hearing, and the RPD is actively involved in creating the record by questioning witnesses, distributing country conditions documents, requesting information from the IRB Research Directorate, and inquiring into \"any matter that it considers relevant\" (", "Act", ", s 170(a)). These differences make the RPD much better suited than the RAD to make findings of fact. Because it hears and elicits evidence, the Respondent says that the RPD is more familiar with a refugee's claim as a whole, and this is historically one of the reasons that appellate courts defer to trial courts on factual questions (citing", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). In the Respondent's view, the RAD should only substitute its own opinion for that of the RPD on questions of law."], ["[20]", "The Respondent also states that, while the RAD can substitute its disposition for that of the RPD's in some circumstances, the Federal Court of Appeal can do the same with respect to decisions of the Federal Court (", "Federal Courts Act", ", RSC 1985, c F-7, s 52(b)(i) [", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "]); and yet, that power alone does not demand an appeal", "de novo", ". Neither does the forward-looking assessment of risk in the refugee process require a completely new assessment of the evidence by the RAD when it has not had the benefit of hearing from the claimants directly.

One line of cases concludes that the RAD should review the RPD's findings of fact for palpable and overriding errors (see e.g.:", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED; and", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). Another line of cases concludes that the RAD must independently come to a decision and is not limited to intervening on the standard of palpable and overriding error, although it can \"recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion\" (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED; and", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[22]", "In this case, the RAD clearly adopted the factors found in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "in determining the appropriate standard of review in the appeal.

The notion of deference to administrative tribunal decision-making requires a respectful attention to the reasons offered or which could be offered in support of the decision made. Even if the reasons given do not seem wholly adequate to support the decision, the RAD must first seek to supplement them before it substitutes its own decision."], ["[30] The appropriate standard of review in these appeals is one of reasonableness.

The RAD has an appellate function, and it cannot limit its analysis merely to whether the RPD acted reasonably and reached a decision that fell within the range of acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law. Applying the reasonableness standard, as the RAD did in this case, is typically an error, since it denies to appellants the appeal to which they were entitled (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED).

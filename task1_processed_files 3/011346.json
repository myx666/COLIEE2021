As a result, they thought he was also providing money to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE], and abducted and detained him for three days, during which time they beat him.

Thus, to rebut the Board's conclusion on the threats, the evidence would have had to have been sufficient to rebut the Board's credibility finding or its finding that the Applicant had not been extorted by the EPDP and the army. The Board's credibility findings were based on a number of factors, including that it found the Applicant to be evasive and lacking in credibility when he was examined at the airport, and that there were several material omissions and inconsistencies between the Applicant's PIF narrative and what he told Immigration authorities regarding his fears and alleged experiences in Sri Lanka. In order for the Officer to have found the documents compelling (or sufficient) enough to overcome the RPD findings, in my view they would have had to have show something more compelling than simply another visit from paramilitary forces, or belief that the Applicant would be at risk at the airport upon re-entry."], ["[31]", "It fell short of this, according to the Officer.

The RPD rejected the claims, raising credibility concerns and instances of inconsistent testimony of the Applicant. The Applicant produced new evidence - both of a personal nature and objective country documentation.

The Officer assessed the risk to the Applicant as a failed asylum seeker from Canada (with any perceptions of wealth that brings), just as the RPD had already assessed this issue at the Board level.

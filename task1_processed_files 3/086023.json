However, prior to elaborating on this finding, it is important to note the factual background underlying Apotex's surprisingly technical standing defence against its alleged infringement."], ["[11]", "That factual background overwhelmingly supports AstraZeneca Canada's standing in this case. AstraZeneca Canada has sold Nexium in Canada for the last 13 years. During those 13 years, AstraZeneca Aktiebolag has supplied AstraZeneca Canada with either bulk tablets or pre-packaged Nexium except for two brief interruptions in supply where AstraZeneca UK was a substitute supplier for approximately 3-6 months. In turn, AstraZeneca Canada sold Nexium in Canadian markets, as its name suggests, throughout those 13 years. Now, both AstraZeneca Canada and AstraZeneca Aktiebolag are joined before this court seeking recovery for AstraZeneca Canada's losses caused by Apotex's alleged infringement in the Canadian market. For Apotex to claim that there was no implied license, no right whatsoever, arising from a common understanding between AstraZeneca Canada and AstraZeneca Aktiebolag that AstraZeneca Canada was entitled to sell Nexium in Canada, strains credulity. Presumably, Apotex is of the opinion that AstraZeneca Aktiebolag supplied AstraZeneca Canada with pre-packaged Nexium for some purpose other than its sale - perhaps, for the profitable venture of storing unsold pharmaceuticals. In this regard, Justice Rothstein's remarks in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 99 are on point:", "It is perhaps not uncalled for to observe that this is not a case in which the alleged licensee is alone in advancing its claim for patent infringement.

The DE 455 generally describes and claims \"salts with bases\" which AstraZeneca contrasts with the '653's specific enumeration of base addition salts. This difference, however, is superficial. The skilled person would have understood the DE 455's reference to \"salts with bases\" as referring to pharmaceutically acceptable salts that can be formed from the addition of a base. No inventive ingenuity would have been required to know that these would include salts formed by the addition of metal cations, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, in an appropriate hydroxide. The DE 455 notes that basic salts of the racemic substrates can be formed with these metallic cations in a \"customary manner\" and that the skilled person would recognize that these same cations could also be used to form salts of the resulting enantiomers. While AstraZeneca's experts (Drs. Davies and Armstrong) emphasized that the specific salts enumerated in the '653 were not exemplified in the DE 455, this came across in their testimony as a minor technical difference easily overcome by the skilled person. Further, as Dr. Jacobsen explained:", "[P]reparation of salts is advantageous for purification for storage, for handling of compounds, and it's the norm in pharmaceuticals. In fact, omeprazole, which was a marketed drug at that time, was sold as a salt. As a salt, they called, with base. That simply means that the salt is generated by adding a base and generating a deprotonated form of omeprazole as a salt. That salt has to have a cation, a plus charge, to go with it. Those are listed as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, types of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. This is very, very standard language in any pharmaceutical patent or description and a skilled chemist would understand what's referred to by those salts. It's simply sort of a simple matter of considering the readily accessible salts of the compound in question.

When viewed in light of the compelling evidence raised by Apotex on this point, AstraZeneca's evidence was insufficient to rebuild its claim that listing specific salts is inventive."], ["[303]", "Further, as chemistry is an experimental field, this conclusion is bolstered by how identifying specific salts in light of the state of the art is, at a minimum, obvious to try. The procedure described for the making of omeprazole salts in the '495 could be used, without modification, to obtain the salts of the enantiomers of omeprazole, and the skilled person would know that the same method could be employed to form salts of the enantiomers of omeprazole with bases and could readily determine which of the salts formed the best crystalline solid. As a consequence, no inventive step would be required to go from the state of the art (salts with bases) to the inventive concept in the '653 (enumerated salts)."], ["[304]", "The (-) enantiomer of omeprazole was also an obvious extension on the state of the art.

Before his testimony there was minimal engagement between the experts - they simply disagreed about whether or not the skilled person would have been motivated to separate the enantiomers of omeprazole before the filing date. However, after Dr. Armstrong's testimony, it became clear that the differences in opinion amongst the experts with respect to omeprazole could be explained by the varying specificity of their analysis. Put differently, Dr. Armstrong explained how, while there was a motivation", "generally", "to separate racemic drugs, there was no motivation", "specifically", "to separate omeprazole because of its unique attributes, namely, a wide therapeutic profile and no toxicity."], ["[309]", "First, it is undisputed that there was little to no motivation to investigate the difference in PPI activity between the enantiomers of omeprazole. This is because of the mechanism of action of omeprazole through which its enantiomers are converted into an achiral sulfenamide - the inhibitory active agent in the parietal cell. As explained earlier, chirality is the primary attribute distinguishing the enantiomers. Consequently, the transfer into an", "achiral", "sulfenamide eliminates that difference, leaving the enantiomers with presumably equal effect."], ["[310]", "Second, there was no motivation to investigate differences in toxicity between the enantiomers. Omeprazole was very safe, with an \"unusually high\" therapeutic index (meaning that there was an inordinately high spread between safe and unsafe doses when administering omeprazole). A safe racemic drug with little to no negative side effects provides minimal motivation to investigate the enantiomers to identify whether negligible amounts of toxicity originate with a particular enantiomer."], ["[311]", "Third, there was little to no motivation to investigate different enantiomers in the interest of improving on the properties of omeprazole. Dr. Wainer (for Apotex) spoke at length about the \"possibility\" that an enantiomer \"could\" have improved properties over its racemate - a contention that AstraZeneca does not dispute. However, researchers have limited time and resources. It is unrealistic to assume that the skilled person would pursue every possible inquiry until it was proven unfruitful (even if information is the \"lifeblood\" of the chemist, as Dr. Jacobsen described). Instead, the skilled person, when faced with a scientific problem, would weigh costs and benefits of various options in charting a reasonable course of research. In this regard, Dr. Davies views were most on point:", "Chemistry is certainly an experimental science, but there are millions of experiments out there to do. You have to pick ones that you think are reasonably going to - there's a reasonable course of action. If you don't have any expectation it's going to work, why would you go down that track?

Virtually any scientific endeavour \"could\" yield helpful results. The focus when discussing the factor of motivation in the context of obviousness is not about whether there is a theoretical motivation that can be speculated about, but rather, whether or not a specific motivation would have actually existed with respect to the patent in question. As Justice Rothstein held  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -Synthelabo Plavix", ", at para 90:", "It is well known that the pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive. Market participants are continuously in search of new and improved medications and want to reach the market with them as soon as possible.

However, nothing in the '875 patent or common general knowledge provided a", "specific motivation", "for the skilled person to pursue the '777 invention. The prior patent was a genus patent, and selection might be expected. However, the prior patent did not differentiate between the efficacy and the toxicity of any of the compounds it covered. This suggests that what to select or omit was not then self-evident to the person skilled in the art (emphasis added)."], ["[313]", "In this case, no such specific motivation to separate the enantiomers of omeprazole existed. The state of the art with respect to omeprazole would have informed the skilled person that it would have been \"very difficult to improve on omeprazole\" because of its characteristics: a wide therapeutic index, known safety and efficacy, and clinically negligible differences in metabolism between individuals. Apotex's attempt at describing the motivation as a desire to know everything about omeprazole and its enantiomers (potential toxicity, potential properties) is unpersuasive without a scientific problem to be addressed. It is too easy for a generic to argue that a motivation stems from a desire to comprehensively record all potential information about a compound when there is nothing", "motivating", "the recording of that information."], ["[314]", "Further, the absence of studies on other similar racemic drugs bolsters the conclusion that there was minimal motivation to separate the enantiomers of omeprazole. There is no evidence of any racemic drug that as of May 1993 was considered safe and efficacious with a wide therapeutic index, where one of the enantiomers was developed to a clinical drug because of differences in the affinities of the enantiomers for drug metabolizing enzymes."], ["[315]", "In sum, there was little to no motivation to investigate the enantiomers of omeprazole. Apotex convincingly argued that the skilled person would have a general interest in enantiomers. Indeed, many other pharmaceutical discoveries discussed in this case related to racemic drugs and their enantiomers. However, AstraZeneca", "specifically", "distinguished omeprazole from that", "general", "interest given omeprazole's unique attributes. It was a widely successful \"blockbuster\" drug whose enantiomers presented a low expectation of improvement on the racemate because of its wide therapeutic window and lack of toxicity. This absent motivation strongly militates in favour of the inventiveness required in attaining a single enantiomer with an optical purity of 99.8%ee.", "(ii) Climate in the Field"], ["[316]", "In", "Novopharm Levofloxacin", ", this factor was described as the \"attitudes, trends, prejudices and expectations\" in the field (at para 25).

This further undermines the obviousness of separating its enantiomers and investing energy in isolating them with an optical purity reaching 99.8%ee."], ["[318]", "The evidence showed that many large pharmaceutical corporations, rather than looking into the enantiomers of omeprazole, were instead investigating analogues (i.e. new molecules with structural similarities to omeprazole). Most notably, with respect to Sepracor, a company who specifically adopted the business model of patenting single enantiomeric forms of racemic drugs, there was no suggestion that it had ever applied to patent esomeprazole or expressed an interest in doing so. This absence of interest from Sepracor, of all companies, in omeprazole, casts significant doubt on Apotex's assertion that there was a specific motivation to investigate the enantiomers of omeprazole, or that the climate in the field would have encouraged such an investigation."], ["[319]", "The \"climate in the field\" factor is also engaged by the purported", "expectation", "of racemisation for esomeprazole and the", "prejudice", "that this allegedly caused against further consideration of separating the enantiomers of omeprazole. While I ultimately find that the \"fear of racemisation\" advanced by AstraZeneca is unpersuasive, the climate in the field still leans in favour of the non-obviousness of the '653 because of the trends discussed above with respect to investigating analogues. In other words, the motivation to not investigate the enantiomers of omeprazole still stands despite the lack of a fear of racemization. A", "fear", "of razemization is merely a deterrent against researching esomeprazole. Eliminating that deterrent against researching esomeprazole (removing a stick) is not equivalent with creating an incentive to perform such research (adding a carrot)."], ["[320]", "The purported fear of racemisation advanced by AstraZeneca is unpersuasive and therefore would not have deterred the skilled person from investigating the enantiomers of omeprazole. The basis for a fear of racemisation was the Brändström paper (Brändström A, \"Chemical reactions of omeprazole and omeprazole analogues. III Protolytic behaviour of compounds in the omeprazole system\"", "Acta Chem Scand", ". (1989) 43:569); a paper not addressing the racemisation of omeprazole, but rather, which provides indirect support for a speculative", "possibility", "of racemisation.

Unfortunately for AstraZeneca, that pillar rested on a weak foundation of science and reason."], ["[321]", "First, Apotex's experts' disbelief in a fear of racemisation facing the skilled chemist is more credible because its experts more closely emulated the perspective of the skilled person. Drs.

Davies and Armstrong (for AstraZeneca) did not. More specifically, the Apotex experts were \"blinded\" from the 653 for their initial reports addressing whether and how the enantiomers of omeprazole could be obtained. By contrast, Dr. Davies has given extensive evidence in prior esomeprazole litigation, while Dr. Armstrong, to a lesser extent, has also addressed the '653 patent in a prior case."], ["[322]", "Admittedly, I have accepted conclusions put forward by the AstraZeneca experts on other points above, such as motivation, despite their not being blinded to the 653. That is because, put simply, the explanations advanced by the experts for AstraZeneca, on those points, were more persuasive. However, the blinding of the Apotex experts is particularly relevant to the issue of a fear of racemisation because that fear is predicated on a single paper that the skilled chemist would likely not have considered particularly relevant or interpreted as the AstraZeneca experts urge. The Apotex experts, who emulated a literature search that would have been performed by the skilled chemist investigating the separation of omeprazole (a literature search made particularly convincing given their lack of knowledge with respect to the '653), failed to find any basis for a fear of racemisation. Their approach to the search was rigorous and credible. Indeed, Dr. Danheiser took emulating the skilled person so seriously that he performed a manual search of archived chemical abstracts to", "literally", "follow the precise steps that would have been pursued by the skilled person as of the relevant date."], ["[323]", "In contrast, AstraZeneca did not endeavour to similarly situate its witnesses. Further, AstraZeneca's experts commented on publications provided to them by counsel, even where they appeared in journals the experts themselves had never heard of or read. This approach casts significant doubt on the fear of racemisation proposed by AstraZeneca. While the '653 patent does describe the stability against racemisation of the claimed salts as being \"surprising,\" AstraZeneca's approach leaves the impression that its experts, who consulted the '653 in advance of providing their reports, went about to justify that proposition rather than test its veracity."], ["[324]", "Second, Apotex's experts' disbelief in a fear of racemisation facing the skilled chemist is more credible because their interpretation of the Brändström paper - the foundation of the fear of racemisation - is more reasonable. In their initial reports, the Apotex experts say little to nothing about Brändström because, in their view, the skilled person seeking to resolve omeprazole would concentrate primarily on the DE 455 and Erlandsson - two pieces of prior art with clear and direct relevance to the problem before them. By contrast, the AstraZeneca experts took a single passage from the Brändström paper, dissociated from the paper's thesis, and stretched that passage as far as possible to justify a fear of racemisation. To be clear, my issue with the fear of racemisation described by AstraZeneca is not that racemisation is scientifically impossible, but rather, that the weight assigned to a fear of racemization was inordinate - a fear more analogous to a paper tiger than a lion in the path of the skilled person (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[325]", "To understand why AstraZeneca's emphasis on the Brändström-based fear of racemisation was inordinate demands a brief outline of the logic and science behind the argument. Brändström does not stand for the proposition that omeprazole will inevitably racemize in all circumstances and that its resolution is therefore a fruitless endeavour. Rather, in a single passage, it indicates that deprotonation of a methylene group is possible at a pKA of the methylene protons that is \"too high to be of interest.\" From this, the AstraZeneca experts", "extrapolated", "about how that deprotonation could lead to racemization. But Brändström provides no experimental detail as to the conditions in which this racemization occurred or whether those conditions are ones that they should worry about in the formation of a salt. Further, Brändström does not indicate that the deprotonation caused a chemical reaction which would lead to racemization or degradation."], ["[326]", "The paralyzing fear of racemization advanced by AstraZeneca, based on a single reference that was not found by the credible literature searches performed by Apotex's blinded experts, is unconvincing. At most, such an extrapolation would have alerted the skilled person to a possible speed bump, rather than an insurmountable barrier. To permit such extraneous concerns to preclude the skilled person from performing routine testing in the investigation of science would preclude the ability of the skilled person to adequately emulate the predicted conduct of researchers in the patent law context. Every scientific question has some footnote in an obscure publication suggesting possible struggles when researching a question. To allow innovators to stretch those footnotes into guaranteed ingenuity on the part of their patents would set too high a standard for obviousness. Extrapolation is certainly a part of distilling and interpreting complex scientific literature, but extrapolating from minor speculative harms into blanket prohibitions on areas of research is simply not reflective of the reasonable conduct of scientific researchers or the skilled person."], ["[327]", "Further, Apotex convincingly argued that the fear of racemisation flowing from Brändström was not only inordinately weighted, but ill-founded. Deprotonation of the methylene proton is extremely unlikely to occur or would occur to an infinitesimally small degree because of the high pKA of the protons on the methylene group which would be very difficult to abstract. Additionally, extensive literature on chiral sulfoxides (the family to which omeprazole belongs) states that deprotonation does not result in racemization. AstraZeneca claimed that omeprazole was unique and would not behave like other chiral sulfoxides, but the mechanisms for racemisation advanced by its experts were thoroughly debunked under cross-examination as, at best, speculative concerns falling below an expectation that would dissuade the skilled person from investigating the omeprazole enantiomers."], ["[328]", "In sum, the climate in the field also favours the non-obviousness of the '653.

To be clear, the obviousness inquiry considers whether or not the \"state of the art,\" not a single piece of art, can reach the invention without an inventive step. That said, three principal approaches were advanced by Apotex: (1) DE 455, (2) the Erlandsson paper, and (3) commercially available columns. None of these approaches, either independently or in conjunction, would have obviously led to the degree of purity attained in the '653."], ["[331]", "With respect to the DE 455, I cannot accept Apotex's contention that attaining the '653 patent's degree of purity was obvious to the skilled person when Apotex's purported re-enactment of the skilled person's resolution of esomeprazole in 1993 consisted of two highly esteemed chemists in 2013, never instructed to emulate the skilled chemist, who only performed a trial in the presence of opposing counsel after performing", "ex parte", "trials first. If a 99.8%ee level of purity really was", "obvious", "to the skilled person then an individual much closer in aptitude and experience to that skilled person ought to have reached it through routine trials, not careful calibration of the DE 455 by leading academics whose approach to the DE 455 could only be scrutinized once polished from multiple practice runs."], ["[332]", "With respect to Erlandsson, given Apotex's view that the skilled person is naturally motivated to achieve the highest purity possible, Erlandsson's achievement of 91.2%ee purity is presumably from an optimized process seeking a maximal purity. This view is bolstered by Dr. Armstrong's explanation of how the efficiency of Erlandsson's resolution, which was likely optimized for, engages the same factors as those related to achieving maximal purity. As a consequence, Apotex's assertion that Erlandsson could simply be improved upon is unconvincing. Further, Apotex's view that techniques from Erlandsson, such as peak-shaving and recycling, could simply be repeated until any desired purity was achieved are unconvincing. As Dr. Armstrong observed:", "If you have broad peaks [...] if you run it through the system again, they get even broader which goes against separation and you're in danger of the recycled portion overlapping with the other side of the other peak. That is the danger.

Apotex relied on the testing results of Dr. Conor Scully to demonstrate the ability for commercially available columns to achieve the purity attained by the '653 patent. However, Dr. Scully's use of a 1999 column to emulate a 1993 column with no evidence that they would operate with equivalent proficiency (but rather, some evidence that advances over those 6 years likely would have occurred) is unconvincing."], ["[335]", "In particular, Dr. Okamoto, Apotex's primary witness who testified regarding the similarities between the 1993 and 1999 columns, conceded that he had little to no actual knowledge of whether any changes may have been made during that six year span. He also conceded that Daicel (the column manufacturer) had problems with its columns in the early 1990s that it may have sought to remedy, a fact which Dr. Armstrong also confirmed. Additionally, Apotex made little effort to ensure that Dr. Scully's testing reflected the testing that would have been performed by the skilled person. Dr. Scully was not instructed to perform the testing as such a person. Even further, Dr. Scully was told which limited solvents to purchase, to only use those solvents, and even which solvent ratios to start with. In total, Apotex was incapable of demonstrating that Dr. Scully's testing and the columns he used were materially analogous to the skilled person and the columns that person would have used as of May 1993. As a consequence, Apotex's testing with 1999 columns provides minimal support to its claim that commercially available 1993 columns would have obviously led the skilled person to the degree of purity attained in the '653 patent."], ["[336]", "In sum, having reviewed all of the key pieces of prior art forming the state of the art and the various testing results applying that state of the art to the task of resolving omeprazole, the extent, nature and amount of effort required to achieve the invention in the '653 patent did not consist merely of routine trials. Rather, the skilled person would have been confronted with multiple avenues, none of which would self-evidently lead to the significant purity achieved in the '653 patent.

The \"Omeprazole Successor Project,\" AstraZeneca's research initiative focussed on omeprazole analogues (rather than omeprazole enantiomers) was the primary focus of AstraZeneca's research and development aimed at following up on omeprazole. Though von Unge was a member of the successor project, AstraZeneca's policy enabling researchers to spend 10-20% of their time on personal projects enabled von Unge to pursue his informal side project of resolving omeprazole sporadically over the course of two years.

Further, von Unge's experimentation, which involved the manipulation of various analogues and chiral auxiliaries with varying connectivity, suggests that his work was not a routine experiment self-evidently resulting in high optical purity, but rather, multiple experiments involving the exercise of discretion and indicative of inventive ingenuity.", "(v) Commercial/Clinical Success"], ["[342]", "The Federal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Levofloxacin", "states that secondary factors - like commercial success - \"may be relevant but generally bear less weight because they relate to facts arising after the date of the alleged invention\" (at para 25).

There is, however, evidence that while \"BFs\" or bring forward notes for files are printed on a nightly basis, the visa officer only actually checks on BFs for his files on a monthly basis. Thus, it might take up to a month after the BF date before an officer would begin taking steps on the file by, for instance, checking for documents or communicating with the SLO officer to see what progress has been made. Had the visa officer in all cases acted on information submitted by the applicants on a timely basis, a great number of delays could have been avoided."], ["[20]", "The applicant and his counsel are not responsible for the delay.

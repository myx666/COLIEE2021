The Applicants, Brian Jackson, Daniel Northman, Rod North Peigan and Janet Potts challenge both the decision of Rebecca Yellow Wings, the Band's Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) and that of the Piikani Nation Election Appeals Board (Board), both of which concluded that the Applicants were ineligible to stand for election as Band councillors in the Piikani Nation Band council election of January 4, 2007. This dispute was part of an internal conflict concerning Band affairs. The two judicial review applications were heard together."], ["[2]", "The background of these proceedings was the application of a traditional Band principle of behaviour (PIIKANISSINI) into the consideration of the Applicants' eligibility to run for office, which resulted in their disqualification for candidacy.

The second letter added another councillor, Peter Yellow Horn, to the same allegations."], ["[9]", "The allegations of disgraceful and shameful conduct concerned the mishandling of Piikani Nation funds and the breach of a Trust Agreement. A copy of a Statement of Claim against the named persons was attached to the first letter. The thrust of the complaint is that the conduct dishonoured and brought shame on the Piikani Nation, that the individuals conducted corrupt practices contrary to the principles of PIIKANISSINI and had negatively affected the dignity and integrity of the Piikani Nation. The result is that under tribal custom, as particularly enshrined in the principles of PIIKANISSINI, these individuals were ineligible to be nominated for or hold Band offices."], ["[10]", "Yellow Wings conducted a hearing for each of the Applicants to deal with their eligibility for nomination. There was some difficulty contacting all of the Applicants. Three of the Applicants, Peigan, Jackson and Potts, attended at the electoral office to submit their required background checks and the hearings on their eligibility were conducted at the same time. The Applicant Northman did not have a hearing."], ["[11]", "Yellow Wings informed the three Applicants who had attended the hearing that their names would be removed from the candidates' list.

The evidence is that PIIKANISSINI mandates a conduct of loyalty and honesty towards the Piikani Nation.

Their wisdom and direction are to be respected and followed."], ["[23]", "It may well be, and the evidence suggests it, that the people believed that the Elders could invoke PIIKANISSINI and declare a person ineligible to stand for election.

It would be inconsistent with the evidence of intent as to the grounds for ineligibility to read in grounds specifically stated elsewhere. The old Latin phrase \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\" is perhaps apt here."], ["[26]", "It is important to note also that in the case of removal, where this higher standard of conduct is relevant, the procedures are more stringent than that of an ineligibility ruling. The two processes are not so synonymous that the principle flows between them seamlessly."], ["[27]", "The Court is also asked to read in to the", "Election Code", "the authority of the Elders to voice opinion and have that opinion followed. The evidence on this point is tenuous. Certainly some Elders (it is unclear if all were involved) thought that they had a role and that the CEO thought that their opinion was binding.

In a small band, 600 people petitioned for the removal of the then-Band council (of which the Applicants were members) and to have an election. None of the incumbents who ran in the election were successful. The Applicants seem to have simply lost an opportunity to lose."], ["[34]", "There is precedent in this Court's jurisprudence for upholding the results of a flawed election process, although technically, the Applicants have not asked for that relief. Rather, they only sought a quashing of the CEO's decision and the placing of their names on a Nomination List, which no longer exists."], ["[35]", "In", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED set out the discretionary factors in not issuing an order quashing election results.

The applicant was approached by individuals from the MS-13 gang and told that he would need to pay for protection. Thereafter, he was approached by several members of the 18 Street Gang, who had seen him interacting with MS-13 gang members. They asked him whether he was a member of MS-13. When he denied this, the 18 Street Gang members also demanded payment. The applicant went to the police and was told to either pay the gangs or get a gun and shoot them when they came after him. The police did not take a report.", "b. A week later, the18 Street gang approached the applicant's vegetable stand and demanded more money. He gave them what he could and told him he would pay the rest later. The next day the MS-13 gang demanded money. The applicant gave them a small amount. He again went to the police and was told they could do nothing and that many police officers had relatives who were gang members.", "c. The applicant planned to move his vegetable stand, as the gangs continued to harass him for money. He went to the police again but was told they could not help him. He then moved 2-3 hours away and set up his vegetable stand. Near the end of September 2007 one of the MS-13 gang members saw him. Later that day, seven gang members approached the applicant, told him the gang was expecting his payment, and that he should expect a visit the next day. The applicant went to the police and was told that \"everybody is in the same situation.\" The applicant's brother gave him a gun which he pawned to get money to make the payment.", "d. In December, MS-13 gang members once again asked the applicant for money. On December 13, 2007, the applicant was beaten, shot under his right knee, and stabbed in the stomach. The applicant was hospitalized for two weeks following this attack. The applicant then fled Honduras and arrived in Canada via Guatemala, Mexico and the United States."], ["[9]", "The Officer noted that the applicant relied on his affidavit and had no corroborative evidence (Application Record, p. 10):", "The applicant states that he asked his brother to get police reports for him. The police apparently wanted to know why the applicant did not come for them himself. They advised the brother to stay away and mind his own business. The applicant states that he called a lawyer friend of his asking her to get the hospital records for him. She was told at the hospital that they should have the records but they did not know how long it would take to retrieve them. They can easily retrieve the files of their regular patients. Apparently it is not so for singular instances."], ["[10]", "The Immigration Officer found that the objective evidence was that law enforcement authorities in Honduras were taking steps to deal with gang violence and that there was no objective evidence that the police were unwilling to investigate gang-related crime. The Officer noted that in fact, the anti-gang laws had been criticized for their severity by human-rights activists (p. 12):", "It is clear from the research that Honduras faces many challenges with respect to gangs. I note that the government has undertaken measures to deal with this, most notably in the law on illicit associations ...It is this law which is used to deal with the gang problem and has come under fire from the NGO community as being to heavy-handed and violating human rights.

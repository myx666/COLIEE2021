According to the Respondent, it follows that since \"drugs\" could connote a variety of drug-related services, it is not clearly descriptive. Similarly, the word \"Canada\" is capable of multiple meanings. Secondly, since \"Canada drugs\" is not a grammatically correct phrase, it would, in the Respondent's opinion, be viewed by the ordinary consumer as a coined phrase, and therefore also as a brand identifier, such as was found to be the case in", "Pizza Pizza"], ["[37]", "The Respondent cites the following cases as those within which a suggestive mark is sufficiently capable of distinguishing the wares or services of the owner so as to be registrable:", "- KOOL ONE for beer ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra,)", "- CALLING CARD for telecommunication services charged to authorized account numbers (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 12 (T.D.))"], ["[38]", "The ordinary, everyday consumer in this case is an individual in Canada who purchases pharmaceuticals over the Internet.

Notwithstanding that the phrase CANADA DRUGS is not grammatically, correct, I am not convinced that it would seem like a \"coined phrase\" to the ordinary consumer."], ["[39]", "Furthermore, the meaning of \"drugs\", in the eyes of the ordinary, everyday consumer would not mean an organization providing information relating to drugs, or drug marketing or merchandising, as the Respondent has suggested, since the ordinary consumer in this case would not generally be familiar with drug marketing or merchandizing. A pharmaceuticals manufacturer would typically identify itself using the term \"pharmaceuticals\" and not \"drugs\". In considering the product or service, I find on a balance of probabilities that, as a matter of first impression and as a matter of common sense, the ordinary consumer would consider the descriptive character of the marks to go to the material composition of the services; meaning that \"Canada Drugs\" would indicate pharmaceuticals from Canada to the ordinary consumer. In concluding that the Mark is clearly descriptive, I am conscious of the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , which emphasizes the importance of not critically analyzing alternate implications of words but rather looking at the words in association with the service from the perspective of the public at large."], ["[40]", "The purpose of the prohibition in s. 12(1)(b) is to prevent any single trader from monopolizing a term that is clearly descriptive or common to the trade, and thereby place legitimate competitors at an undue disadvantage. In light of the characteristics embodied by the ordinary consumer, we must consider the importance of the phrase \"Canada Drugs\" with respect to Internet search engines and search terms, which would be a primary method of finding products online. Considering that much of the Internet is centred around the American market, a consumer trying to find a pharmacy in Canada might very well type \"Canada\" , \"Canada\" and \"drugs\" are two generic terms that would be used by the ordinary consumer identified in this case to locate pharmacies in Canada on the Internet. As the evidence shows that there are many businesses which would match this description, I am of the opinion that permitting this combination of words common to the trade to be trademarked would result in an undue disadvantage for legitimate competitors. Moreover, the evidence shows that the terms \"Canada\" and \"drugs\" are used by the press in describing pharmaceuticals from Canada. For example, CNN.com carried a story on January 19, 2004, the headline of which reads \"FDA: U.S. generics better buy than Canada drugs\". In the Chicago Sun-Times, a headline reads \"Blagojevich asks Bush for help with Canada drugs\", and on Forbes.com a story dated February 2, 2004, carries the headline \"U.S. FDA turns up heat in battle over Canada drugs\". None of these stories refer to the Respondent Canada Drugs Ltd, nor do they use \"Canada\" and \"drugs\" as a trademark. I note that while the press clippings in evidence are products of U.S. media, the sources, particularly those online, would have been available in Canada. I come to the same conclusion in respect of CANADADRUGS.COM. The terminator \".com\" is so common in Internet-oriented trademarks that it has lost any meaning it once had. Without this, the remainder is merely a conflation of \"Canada\" and \"drugs\".", "\"Deceptively Misdescriptive\""], ["[41]", "The purpose of denying the registration of deceptively misdescriptive trademarks is to prevent the public from being misled (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  found deceptively misdescriptive, a mark must first be found to be descriptive so as to suggest that the wares or service are or contain something that is not the case (", "Atlantic", ", supra). <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> teaches that the word must also relate to the composition of the goods and falsely or erroneously describe something which is material or purport to qualify something as material to the composition of the goods when in fact it is not."], ["[42]", "Pharmawest submits that the Respondent's trademarks clearly describe services relating to pharmaceuticals that originate from Canada. The evidence shows that even though the orders are taken in Canada, the pharmaceuticals do not all originate in Canada, nor are the dispensing facilities all located in Canada. The Respondent counters that, since the trademarks are not clearly descriptive, they cannot be found to be deceptively misdescriptive."], ["[43]", "While section 26(1)(c) of the", "Unfair Competition Act", ", R.S.C. 1952, c. 274, used the expression \"clearly misdescriptive\", when the provision was incorporated into the", "Trade-marks Act", "the adjective modifying descriptive was changed to \"deceptively\". The jurisprudence cited above shows that to be \"deceptively misdescriptive\", a trademark must be descriptive, and must incorporate an element of deception. Concerning the CANADA DRUGS Mark, the evidence shows that the pharmaceuticals used to fill the prescriptions are manufactured all around the world, and not just in Canada. In itself, this may not be sufficient to find that the Mark is \"deceptively misdescriptive\" because the general public would know that some pharmaceuticals being sold were produced by American or European corporations. However, in light of the fact that the prescriptions are not always filled by a Canadian pharmacy, I find that the ordinary consumer would be deceived as to the product. Of importance here is the recognition that Canadian consumers would trust prescription fulfillment from a Canadian pharmacy more than that from other countries. The only consistent connection with Canada, besides the mark CANADA DRUGS, seems to be the Respondent's office where orders are processed. On a balance of probabilities, the ordinary consumer would think that there is a greater connection to Canada than merely the location of the office, such as the origin of the drugs themselves or, at a minimum, the dispensing services.

In considering whether a trademark is distinctive or not, it is appropriate to examine the first impression of the relevant consumers, who are in this case individuals in Canada purchasing pharmaceuticals over the Internet.

During 2005 there were roughly 3,500,000 visits to the website, of which the statistics show that approximately 12.6% are from a Canadian top-level domain (with a \".ca\" suffix). Over $5,000,000 had been spent advertising and promoting the Canada Drugs Marks and Business, including pay-per-click advertising, as well as television, magazine, newspaper and radio advertising."], ["[51]", "Considering that the website was only accessible, at the earliest, on February 28, 2001, and that the evidence shows the bulk of the advertising targeted a U.S. audience, it is difficult to imagine that Canadian consumers would have been sufficiently familiar with the Marks such that they acquired distinctiveness in the 2-3 months between the inception of the website and the applications for registration. In any event, the Respondent provides little, if any, evidence to show that the trademarks had acquired distinctiveness by May 15, 2001. As a result, I find the Respondent has not discharged his onus to take advantage of the exception in s. 12(2).", "Conclusion"], ["[52]", "I have found the trademarks CANADA DRUGS and CANADADRUGS.COM to be both \"clearly descriptive\" and \"deceptively misdescriptive\" under s. 12(1)(b) of the", "Act", ". The Respondent has not discharged his onus under s. 12(2) to show the Marks have acquired distinctiveness as of the registration application, and consequently the Marks are not registrable.

Mr. Towaij conceded that the Syrian authorities were never asked which documentation was required. A birth certificate may have sufficed."], ["[105]", "On re-direct examination, Mr. Towaij said that a determination of the risk that Mr. Almrei may face if removed to Syria was assessed prior to requesting a travel document from the Syrian government.", "2. \"Sukhvindar\""], ["[106]", "\"Sukhvindar\" has been an employee of CSIS for 17 years.

He was hired by CSIS in 1991. He has since worked as an analyst and investigator and is now the \"chief\" of his branch, a management position. His group investigates threats to national security and advises the government of those threats which may include espionage, subversion, fraud-influenced activity and politically-motivated violence. Sukhvindar has investigated the phenomenon of Sunni extremism and has conducted investigations in the area of Shi'ite extremism and in other politically-motivated violence not tied to a particular religion. He has taken a university-level course in understanding the Middle East."], ["[108]", "According to the witness, CSIS broadly views Islamic extremism, whether Sunni or Shi'ite, as a form of politically-motivated violence based on radical interpretations of Islam. Those radical interpretations include and advocate the use of violence. The Service considers Sunni extremism, in particular the al Qaeda movement, to represent a continuing threat to Canada's national security."], ["[109]", "\"Al Qaeda\" means \"the base\". Dating back to approximately 1988, the term referred to an organization with a physical infrastructure. That organization established itself in Afghanistan where several camps were established and people were invited to attend these camps and receive military training to conduct operations in Afghanistan and other regions. The physical infrastructure was displaced in November 2001 and the organization has since evolved."], ["[110]", "The term \"al Qaeda\" now represents more of an ideology or philosophy and a network through which like-minded groups around the world can affiliate to pursue and further the aims and ideologies of the movement."], ["[111]", "After its physical infrastructure was disrupted in Afghanistan, al Qaeda became more of an umbrella organization which continues to issue threats. The most recent was in 2007 when the group identified and targeted countries for attacks. Countries that have been named by leaders in al Qaeda or by people who affiliated themselves with al Qaeda have been subject to terrorist attacks."], ["[112]", "Sukhvindar cited a range of attacks that are either directly attributed to al Qaeda or linked to al Qaeda. For example, in 1998, the bombings of the U.S. missions in Kenya and Tanzania, the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen in 2000, the 9/11 attacks and the London Subway bombings in July 2005."], ["[113]", "The first direct threat to Canada was made by al Qaeda in an audiotape attributed to Osama bin Laden in November 2002. Canada was one of six countries named. Other countries on that list have been subject to terrorist attacks. There have been subsequent references on several occasions to Canada. Canada appeared as the fifth country on a list of six in an al Qaeda manual, the Al-Battar Training Camp Manual found in 2004-2005, as a proposed target of attack. CSIS has since seen references to al Qaeda affiliated groups, like Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula, making threats against Canada and its oil and gas pipelines because we supply oil and gas to the U.S. There were also at least two threats in 2006 directed against Canada because of our troop presence in Afghanistan."], ["[114]", "Sukhvindar testified that he believes that Mr. Almrei attended training camps operated by the al Qaeda movement, that he has visited regions where the conflict between Sunni extremists and others have been ongoing, that he adheres to this violent philosophy which allows for the use of force, and that, as a result, he continues to pose a threat."], ["[115]", "According to the witness, Mr. Almrei has the background, the training, the experience, the willingness and the commitment to follow the ideology and aims of al Qaeda. He has demonstrated an ability to pursue activities consistent with the aims of people who support al Qaeda. He has a pedigree of someone who would assist people seeking to conduct terrorist activities in the name of al Qaeda or its affiliate groups."], ["[116]", "In CSIS' view, as described by Sukhvindar, the release of someone with Mr. Almrei's pedigree and history would be viewed by those who gravitate or adhere to this radical philosophy as a victory for the movement. Further, he would be perceived by people within that milieu as a resource that is again available to further the aims and activities of that movement."], ["[117]", "Sukhvindar said that his use of the term \"pedigree\" regarding Mr. Almrei, refers to his history and background, particularly his travels to Afghanistan to attend a training camp; his travel to a guest house in Peshawar; his travel to Tajikistan to participate in military activity with known al Qaeda members; his proclivity for procuring false documentation and using false documentation; and his efforts to conceal his activities and his history since arriving in Canada."], ["[118]", "CSIS does not allege that Mr. Almrei is a member of al Qaeda, nor that he would engage in violence in Canada, but contends that he is an individual who supports the Bin Laden network. The concern is that Mr. Almrei concealed his background until forced to disclose some details. This is based on his initial Declaration upon arriving in Canada in 1999 in relation to his refugee claim and in his subsequent statements post incarceration. He did not admit to traveling to Afghanistan or to Tajikistan. He concealed his continued possession of a passport from the United Arab Emirates alleging that it had been destroyed. He did not disclose the pseudonym by which he was known to his friends and associates; his \"respect name\", Abu Al-Hareth."], ["[119]", "In Sukhvindar's view, having a respect name is significant, particularly in the context of Sunni extremism, because persons who are trained by al Qaeda are given such names as part of the security around their activities so that they are not easily identifiable. This name and the information about his travels and activities prior to arriving in Canada were not disclosed to the IRB when his application for refugee status was processed."], ["[120]", "A respect name may also serve as a \"nom de guerre\" to protect the identity of someone engaged in jihad. \"Jihad\" is a term that is found in the Koran. It refers to a \"struggle\", as the witness understands the term. CSIS has concerns with the extremist interpretation of jihad which involves a commitment to violence and to furthering the aims or defining that struggle in a violent context, specifically in relation to defending Islam through violence."], ["[121]", "In relation to Afghanistan, the term \"jihad\" was used to attract people to defend Muslims against the Soviet forces which occupied the country for ten years. Since then, it has been used to attract people to other conflicts and to act as part of the broad al Qaeda or Sunni extremist movement in conflicts from Chechnya through Somalia. CSIS does not suggest that the mere attendance or participation in the conflict in Afghanistan or training for jihad would be the sole indicator of someone who constitutes a threat to national security."], ["[122]", "Mr. Almrei had a relationship with Ibn al-Khattab (hereafter Khattab), a leading Sunni jihadist figure, and participated in military operations with him in Tajikistan. That is, in Sukhvindar's view, indicative of a willingness to participate in violence and willingness to assist and further the aims of an organization that pursues violent jihad."], ["[123]", "\"Ibn al-Khattab\" is a nom de guerre. His precise identity remains unclear but he appears to have been of Saudi descent. Khattab came to prominence in the conflict in Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation and emerged as a leader in the jihad in Tajikistan and later in Chechnya until his death in 2002. He was aligned with the objective of al Qaeda to remove the Soviet dominated secular governments and occupying forces from these Islamic lands."], ["[124]", "Khattab led an organization that became known as the International Islamic Peacekeeping brigades. Subsequent to his death, that organization was cited as possibly being responsible for terrorist acts in Russia and Chechnya."], ["[125]", "Mr. Almrei has demonstrated an ability and a willingness to do things that are consistent with the operational requirements of Sunni extremist groups, particularly in relation to acquiring fraudulent documents and using fraudulent documents, according to Sukhvindar. Were he to be released today, CSIS would be concerned that he would be in a position to resume those activities or to counsel others in how to engage in those kinds of activities."], ["[126]", "In Sukhvindar's opinion, the contacts Almrei had prior to his detention may still be viable because he has a reputation and credentials. He has the credentials that come from having been in Afghanistan and Tajikistan with Khattab. The fact that Almrei was able to remain in contact with Khattab while the latter was in Chechnya is significant. It shows that he has some credibility with those within the movement. He can trade on that for years according to Sukhvindar."], ["[127]", "The procurement of documents for fraudulent use facilitates the ability to travel undetected across borders.

For example: the acquisition of a false passport for Nabil al-Marabh, a friend associated with illicit money transfers subsequently arrested in the U.S. and deported to Syria. The witness does not know why Mr. Almrei was not charged with providing a passport to Nabil al-Marabh. He is also not aware whether Mr. Almrei could have been found inadmissible to Canada as a result of a conviction for possessing or dealing in false documents."], ["[129]", "Sukhvindar believes that someone like Mr. Almrei would be in a position to exploit clandestine methodology were he to be released. He could communicate with people in ways that sureties or those charged with monitoring him would not detect. Mr. Almrei was familiar with or used trade craft prior to his detention. He was able to gain access to secure facilities in Canada within months of his arrival (he accessed a restricted area at Pearson International Airport)."], ["[130]", "Almrei lacks a substantive connection to Canada. He has no family here and was not part of an established community structure to the same extent as the other men under security certificates who are now released.

They are now encouraged, inspired and facilitated through the al Qaeda manuals and the information available on the Internet to gain the necessary expertise to conduct terrorist operations.

The witness testified that there is a threat to Canada now from home-grown groups, but did not elaborate."], ["[135]", "The witness agreed with the suggestion that many of the people who went to Afghanistan during the Soviet time are not of great concern to the Service. That experience may be indicative but it is not determinative of whether or not a person is a security risk. He agreed that", "when", "they went to Afghanistan and", "who", "they were planning on fighting are very significant factors. If they were traveling prior to 1989, you would expect that they were intent on fighting the Soviet occupation. During the early 1990s, they would be fighting the Soviet-installed and supported Afghani government and other insurgent groups."], ["[136]", "There was a competition for control of Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal. Within the \"mujahideen\" there were at least three factions - the Taliban, the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar faction and the Northern Alliance. The Taliban seized control of Kabul and established themselves as the government in 1992. The people who joined the Northern Alliance are less of a concern. Subsequent to 2001, the Northern Alliance was no ally to the Taliban and no friend of Osama bin Laden or al Qaeda. The death of its leader, Ahmad Shah Massoud, was likely an operation conducted by al Qaeda."], ["[137]", "Mr. Nabil al-Marabh (or Almarabh) was someone willing to use travel documents fraudulently.

Mr. Almrei has not been linked to the 9/11 attacks or to any specific money transfers. At an address associated with al-Marabh, US law enforcement agents found people with immigration documents believed to be fraudulent and security passes for an airport. Almrei and al-Marabh were both in Afghanistan; both were linked to the jihad in Tajikistan; and both were in contact with each other in Toronto. Both are of concern to the Service.

His understanding is that upon Mr. Almrei's return to Syria (if that were to happen) the authorities would conduct a review.

There have been discussions at CSIS about what would happen to somebody if they were sent back to Syria and were considered a threat to the government of Syria."], ["[139]", "The passport that the Syrian embassy issued to Mr. Almrei for his abortive return in 2003 bore the notation \"Terrorist Suspect\".

However, he believes that Khattab was engaged in violent jihad prior to 1999 in places like Tajikistan when Mr. Almrei was with him. Sukhvindar agrees that there is conflicting information regarding whether Khattab was a member of al Qaeda. The witness is comfortable saying that Khattab was someone who was committed to violent jihad and pursued the same philosophy and ideology as members of the al Qaeda network. He exported that violent jihad from Afghanistan to Tajikistan and Chechnya."], ["[142]", "Sukhvindar agreed with a statement from CSIS' public allegations against Mohamed Harkat that Khattab had never been quoted as calling for jihad between Islam and the West and had never called for jihad against Americans or Jews.

The ability to procure false documents is still there."], ["[147]", "The witness agrees that someone involved in the business of document procurement, especially if they are doing it for a terrorist organization, would be extremely security conscious. It is a very risky activity. Would they use \"clandestine methodologies\" to avoid detection?

Ahmed Ressam, for example, the so-called Millennium bomber, took a name from a child's tombstone and used that to acquire official identity documents. .

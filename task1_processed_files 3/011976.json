He has been living in Canada since October 2007."], ["[3]", "The Applicant came to Canada as a refugee claimant. He sought Canada's protection because homosexuality is a crime in Nigeria and he is homosexual. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (RPD) rejected his claim for protection on 29 January 2010. The RPD found the Applicant was not credible and was not homosexual. It rejected his claim because he had no other nexus to a Convention ground (RPD Decision)."], ["[4]", "After the RPD Decision, the Applicant applied for his PRRA on 14 December 2010 and provided additional written submissions on 23 December 2010. He also provided a letter from his landlord and roommate, Daniel Asaolu (Asaolu), which said Asaolu knew the Applicant was homosexual (Asaolu Letter). The Applicant also submitted a letter from Larry Olugbade (Olugbade) which said Olugbade knew the Applicant was homosexual because of his behaviour and actions (Olugbade Letter). Olugbade said he had seen the Applicant with a man Olugbade believed was the Applicant's boyfriend. The Applicant also provided the Officer with a letter from Samuel Adigun (Adigun), in which Adigun said he and the Applicant were in a relationship and had been going out since April 2010. In addition, the Applicant provided the Officer with several photographs of him with Adigun."], ["[5]", "The Applicant also submitted documents to show the risk he faced in Nigeria because he is homosexual. An affidavit (Arowojobe Affidavit) from Peter Arowojobe (Arowojobe) - a citizen of Nigeria and friend of the Applicant - said Arowojobe had been arrested by a team of police officers in November 2010. The police officers said they were looking for the Applicant because of his homosexual activities and accused Arowojobe of being the Applicant's lover. A further affidavit (Akomolede Affidavit) from Tope Akomolede (Akomolede) - also a Nigerian citizen and the Applicant's friend - said Nigerian police came to his home and asked if he knew where the Applicant was. Akomolede said he did not know where the Applicant was, and the police left telling Akomolede to tell them when he knew of the Applicant's whereabouts."], ["[6]", "The Officer considered the Applicant's PRRA application and rejected it on 30 August 2011.", "DECISION UNDER REVIEW"], ["[7]", "The Decision in this case consists of a letter the Officer sent the Applicant on 30 August 2011 (Refusal Letter), along with the Officer's notes on the file (Notes)."], ["[8]", "The Officer rejected the PRRA application because she determined the Applicant would not face a risk of persecution if he returned to Nigeria. The Applicant also did not face a risk to his life or a risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment."], ["[9]", "The Officer noted the Applicant continued to fear harm in Nigeria because he is homosexual. She then reviewed the RPD's reasons for rejecting his refugee claim. The RPD had found the Applicant's testimony contained inconsistencies. He had also not provided documents to establish his sexual orientation and had not properly documented his homosexual relationship in Canada. The RPD had further found the Applicant did not have a secret homosexual relationship in Nigeria, as he said he had, and was not homosexual."], ["[10]", "The Officer instructed herself on the law applicable to the question before her. She found", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED establishes that a PRRA application is not an appeal of a refugee determination. Rather, it is a process by which any new risks which may have developed since the RPD hearing can be evaluated. Further, subsection 113(a) of the Act establishes that only evidence which arises after the refugee decision, or which was not reasonably available, can be presented on a PRRA application.", "Documentary Evidence"], ["[11]", "The Officer found the Adigun Letter was of low probative value and did not establish the Applicant was in a genuine homosexual relationship. This letter was undated and unsworn and did not provide details of the relationship, including how Adigun and the Applicant met or whether there was a sexual or romantic component to their relationship. The Adigun Letter said that Adigun and the Applicant had been in a relationship for over a year, so the Officer found it was reasonable to expect the Applicant to present more details or evidence to corroborate the relationship."], ["[12]", "The Officer also found the photographs submitted by the Applicant did not show that his relationship with Adigun was genuine. The Applicant had not provided any context or identified the purpose for which the photographs were taken. The photographs were insufficient to overcome the RPD's determination that the Applicant was not credible."], ["[13]", "The other letters were also insufficient to overcome the RPD's finding that the Applicant was not credible. The Asaolu Letter said the author was aware the Applicant is homosexual, but did not include details of how Asaolu knew this was so. Asaolu had not said he had any first-hand knowledge of the Applicant's sexual activities or orientation."], ["[14]", "The Olugbade Letter said \"I got to know Francis Ogunrinde is gay because of his behaviour and actions. I always see him with a guy which I believe is his girlfriend [", "sic", "].\" This letter, however, did not set out what behaviours or actions led Olugbade to believe the Applicant is homosexual, so it was also of low probative value. Further, the Olugbade Letter and Asaolu Letter were both unsworn and undated. Their low probative value did not establish that the Applicant is homosexual. They were insufficient to overcome the RPD's negative credibility finding."], ["[15]", "The Applicant also submitted a letter from Helen Rykens (Rykens Letter), the office manager at the 519 Church Street Community Center (519 Center). The 519 Center provides resources to people in Toronto who are homosexual, bisexual, or transgendered. The Officer found the Rykens Letter was not new evidence because it spoke to membership at the 519 Center. The RPD had dealt with the Applicant's membership in the 519 Center when it evaluated his credibility and the Rykens Letter was insufficient to overcome the RPD's finding that the Applicant was not credible."], ["[16]", "Although the Applicant said he was still at risk in Nigeria, the Officer found this was not so. She found the affidavits he submitted were not enough to establish he is homosexual or that he is wanted by the Nigerian police. The Akomolede Affidavit did not say why the Applicant was wanted by the police and did not provide any insight into the Applicant's homosexuality. Although the Arowojobe Affidavit said the police were interested in the Applicant for his \"gay activities,\" this affidavit did not show that Arowojobe had been arrested or detained. Further, the Arowojobe Affidavit was not corroborated by other evidence."], ["[17]", "The Arowojobe Affidavit attested to new developments in a claim that had already been rejected because the RPD found the Applicant was not credible. The Arowojobe Affidavit was not enough to overcome the RPD's negative credibility finding."], ["[18]", "The Officer found country condition evidence before her showed that conditions in Nigeria were unfavourable for people who are homosexual.

The question before the Officer on the PRRA application was whether, based on the evidence before her, the Applicant was at risk of harm in Nigeria.

First, the Nigerian police believe the Applicant is homosexual and, second, they are seeking him because of his \"gay activities.\" However, the Officer found this affidavit \"is an attestation of new developments in a claim that was already rejected by the [RPD] over credibility.\" The Officer reasons that, because the RPD did not believe the Applicant was homosexual, he could not be at risk in Nigeria on this basis."], ["[38]", "What the Officer fails to consider is that what mattered with respect to the Arowojobe Affidavit was not whether the Applicant is homosexual, but that the authorities in Nigeria believe he is homosexual. This affidavit contained relevant, sworn evidence of the risk the Applicant faces in Nigeria. As a sworn document, the Arowojobe Affidavit was entitled to the presumption of truth. See", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. Whether the RPD found the Applicant credible or not about his homosexual activities in Canada had no bearing on whether the Arowojobe Affidavit establishes a risk in Nigeria.

As for the lack of a police warrant or the name of the \"Investigation Officer,\" the Officer is being wilfully blind in expecting normal formalities in a country where, as the documentary evidence before the Officer makes very clear, homosexuality is not tolerated and the authorities are not likely to treat gay people with any kind of formal respect or due process."], ["[40]", "In my view, then, the rejection of the Arowojobe Affidavit for the reasons given by the Officer is unreasonable. That affidavit says quite clearly that the authorities in Nigeria perceive the Applicant to be homosexual and that they are seeking him for this very reason. This important factor should also have been borne in mind by the Officer when she considered the other new evidence before her."], ["[41]", "The Court is mindful of the difficulties that PRRA officers face when dealing with claimants who assert a risk of harm because of their sexual orientation. Claimants bear the onus of satisfying the officer evaluating their application they have a profile that will put them at risk."], ["[42]", "At the same time, the acts and behaviours which establish a claimant's homosexuality are inherently private.

The Officer gave the Asaolu Letter low probative weight because \"[t]he author of the letter provides no explanation as to how he knows [the Applicant is homosexual], and if he has first hand knowledge of the Applicant's sexual activities and orientation. \"This was an unreasonable basis upon which to assign the letter low probative weight. The Asaolu Letter says that Mr. Asaolu knows the Applicant is gay\" because we have been living in the same apartment since 2007.\" It may lack details, but it cannot be said that Mr. Asaolu \"provides no [...] explanation as to how he knows\" the Applicant is gay.

The letter says that Mr. Asaolu and the Applicant live together. Two people who live together would have some idea as to each other's sexual orientation, particularly in a case like this where the Applicant was in a relationship with another man.

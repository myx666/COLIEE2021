She argues that where an administrative decision-maker has a concern regarding a particular aspect of a file, the specific concern should be conveyed to an applicant who should then be granted an opportunity to respond. The first visa officer identified specific concerns regarding the applicant’s current employment. Because this officer failed to communicate (other than through the CAIPS), those specific concerns to the second visa officer (the decision-maker), the applicant was taken by surprise. The second visa officer focussed on past employment concerns and the applicant (not having been provided notice) was not prepared for the visa officer’s questions in this respect."], ["[11]", "Further, according to the applicant, the visa officer prejudged the matter because the officer had already determined that, in the absence of income tax information or pay stubs, the application must be refused. No such requirement exists in the legislation or CIC policy. The visa officer’s mind was closed to the applicant’s explanations for the absence of these documents. The applicant also contends that the visa officer’s repeated rude and disparaging remarks, comments, mannerisms and unfair behaviour during the interview indicate bias."], ["[12]", "The visa officer has sworn an affidavit denying the allegations and denying any impropriety in the conduct of the interview. The officer was cross-examined on her affidavit.", "Analysis", "Reasonable Apprehension of Bias"], ["[13]", "The standard of review is not applicable to this issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Mr. Justice Nadon, then of the Trial Division, stated:", "22 The standard which will apply to determine if there is a reasonable apprehension of bias will vary, depending on the nature, role and function of the particular tribunal or decision-maker. Since visa officers do not act in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity, a test of bias similar to the test applied to judges or decision-makers acting judicially is not, in my view, appropriate. In my opinion, a less stringent test should be applied to visa officers, one which requires an absence of conflict of interest and a mind that is open to persuasion. Visa officers are expected to have examined an applicant's file and to have conducted an investigation in order to determine if there are any grounds under which an applicant would be inadmissible to Canada before the interview with the applicant takes place. The purpose of the interview, which is usually conducted once the visa officer has determined that he or she has doubts as to whether the applicant is admissible, is for the applicant to dissipate the visa officer's concerns and persuade him that he or she is admissible. The visa officer represents the Minister, and therefore cannot be expected to be as impartial as a judge should be.", "23 In the case at bar, the applicant's concern is that Officer Schultz prejudged his case. On that subject, in D.J.M. Brown & J.M. Evans, Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada, vol. 2 (Toronto: Canvasback Publishing, 1998), the learned authors make the following comments at pages 11-39 and 11-40:", "Circumstances which appear to diverge from the proper adjudicative process by revealing an improper predisposition to deciding the issues in dispute one way rather than another are closely related to instances of \"interest\", \"hostility\" and \"relationships\". That is, an appearance may be created, either from certain behaviour or past circumstances, that evidence has come before the adjudicator other than through the medium of the parties' proofs and arguments, or that the decision-maker did not come to the hearing with an open mind. Thus, there may be thought to have been \"prejudgment,\" \"prior knowledge,\" \"prior adjudication,\" or \"excessive interference,\" or that the decision-maker may have had ex parte contacts with third persons in relation to the matter in question. These circumstances can be loosely characterized as creating an appearance of unfairness.", "Nevertheless, decision-makers cannot realistically be expected to approach an issue unencumbered by attitudes, knowledge or experience that to some extent predispose them in one direction or another. In the words of one judge, to charge adjudicators with bias:", "is not merely to say that they would be likely to decide a particular matter in a particular way, but to say that they would do so improperly.", "Accordingly, the question typically becomes one of whether the decision-maker exhibited such a degree of prejudgment or predisposition to one side or to the other that it gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that the decision-maker is or would be unresponsive to the evidence and arguments advanced at the hearing. [footnotes omitted]"], ["[14]", "In short, a finding of reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of a decision-maker requires something more than an allegation. The evidence before me does not demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of bias."], ["[15]", "In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it must be presumed that a decision-maker will act impartially:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Even in the context of judicial hearings, the apprehension of bias must be reasonable and be held by reasonable and right-minded persons applying themselves to the question and obtaining the required information. The question is -- what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, having thought the matter through, conclude? The grounds must be substantial and the test should not be related to the very sensitive or scrupulous conscience. A real likelihood or probability of bias must be demonstrated and mere suspicion is not sufficient: Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."], ["[16]", "Given the visa officer’s complete denial of the allegations, her reasonable responses on cross-examination and her ultimate reasons for denying the application, the applicant has not demonstrated that bias, or a reasonable apprehension of bias, arose.", "Breach of Procedural Fairness"], ["[17]", "Again, the standard of review does not apply. With respect to procedural fairness, there is no duty to inform an applicant of concerns regarding the strength of the application and supporting materials. While there is some authority to support the proposition that a visa officer has an obligation to inform an applicant when extraneous material (not the situation here) has been considered in evaluating the application for permanent residence, the fact remains that an applicant must provide sufficient information and material to attain a positive outcome."], ["[18]", "Where a visa officer’s concerns relate to the requirements set out in the legislation, the visa officer is under no obligation to apprise an applicant of those concerns:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.C.J. No. 192."], ["[19]", "In this case, the visa officer’s concerns stemmed from a deficiency regarding the applicant’s supporting documentation. There was no duty to put the applicant on notice. The nature of the information was the same as that required upon the submission of the application. The applicant knew precisely what the letters of reference must contain. The question of the applicant’s “knowledge” is discussed in the next section of these reasons. There was no breach of procedural fairness.", "The Reasonableness of the Decision"], ["[20]", "Decisions of visa officers with respect to applications for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker category attract a standard of review of reasonableness or patent unreasonableness.

The visa officer concluded that the reference letters regarding the position as an editor (tribunal record, pp. 10, 11) and the positions as a research assistant and teaching associate (tribunal record pp. 12-15) did not indicate the applicant’s salary and benefits. The applicant did not produce any other evidence (beyond an oral statement that she was paid) to establish that her employment in India was paid employment. Consequently, the visa officer was totally justified in concluding that the applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence of paid employment."], ["[23]", "The applicant is correct that the visa officer could have allowed additional time to enable her to file more comprehensive information about her work experience. However, the officer was not obliged to do so. The visa officer’s failure to provide additional time does not constitute reviewable error."], ["[24]", "Finally, while the information contained in the applicant’s record reveals that the applicant may meet the legislative requirements, that information was not provided to the visa officer and therefore was not before the officer when the decision was made.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FC 144, at paragraphs 15 and 16, I stated:", "15 Ms. Nejad's affidavit of September 25, 2006, reveals that she is not aware of, or is confused regarding, the extent of the court's jurisdiction in matters of judicial review.

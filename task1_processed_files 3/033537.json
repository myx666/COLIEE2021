She fears that the Muñiz family are associated with a drug cartel, Los Zetas. Her family filed another denunciation against the Muñiz family in 2009 and a member of the Muñiz family was arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned.

The evidence before it led the Board to conclude that the risk of crime and violence at the hands of gangs and drug cartels was widespread in El Salvador.

It found that there were avenues for the applicant to seek state protection, including in circumstances where protection might initially be denied because of corruption. Although Ms. Espinoza had alleged that the Muñiz family was linked to the Los Zetas who were in turn linked to the police, the Board noted that a member of the Muñiz family had been prosecuted for the attack on her family and a protection order had been issued against the Muñiz family.

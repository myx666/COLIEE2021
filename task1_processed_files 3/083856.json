Right, (sic) at the break Panel indicated that they weren't interested in the questions I was asking at the time, that that information was already in the PIF. First of all, information was not already in the PIF, it's relevant to credibility on objective basis as are just about every one of the questions I've asked since I started. I object again to the interruption from the Panel and the impeding effect it's having on the presentation of this case. I again invite the Panel, which is within its jurisdiction to do, to find as fact -- to make the findings of fact in respect of the incidents 1 through 13 paragraphs of the PIF narrative. I am aware of what is in the best interest of my client, I fully intend to canvas the issues of October 1996 and all the issues that the Panel identified at the outset of the hearing.

Mr. Rowe then advised the Board that he had other commitments and had to leave shortly. He asked that the matter be adjourned to another day and his request was promptly refused."], ["[10]", "The transcript makes it plain that the Board was unwilling to adjourn for two reasons. Firstly, it felt that Mr. Rowe had been discourteous in not notifying the Board earlier that he needed to leave at about 4:30 p.m., and, secondly, the Board blamed him for the length of the hearing because he ignored the panel's request to abbreviate his examination-in-chief. The transcript also makes it plain that the Board refused the adjournment without asking what Mr. Rowe's commitments were, and, equally, counsel did not explain his need to depart."], ["[11]", "In an increasingly acrimonious exchange, in which there was yelling and a threat to report Mr. Rowe to the Law Society of Upper Canada, nothing was accomplished. The Board refused to adjourn, and Mr. Rowe said he could not stay. Eventually, at approximately 4:45 p.m., Mr. Rowe said \"I am prepared to set an adjournment date; if the panel can't do that, then I am withdrawing and I am advising my client to come with me\".

It was clear that Mr. Rowe was using \"withdraw\" as a synonym for \"leave\". He was leaving the hearing that day.

As well, the applicant left with Mr. Rowe, indicating that he continued to value Mr. Rowe's representation and was not prepared to proceed without his counsel."], ["[14]", "The failure to send the Notice to Mr. Rowe is significant, because the Notice stated that, if the proceeding was not ordered abandoned on February 10, 1998, the applicant was expected to be prepared to conduct the hearing on the merits to completion on that date. In the result, the Notice was sent to the applicant on January 30, 1998, and he received it on February 5, 1998. Thereafter, he met with his lawyer Mr. Rowe on February 7, 1998.

On reading the transcript as a whole, it is not clear to me whether the applicant changed his mind and agreed to proceed on the merits without counsel on February 10, 1998, in response to perceived pressure from the Board, or whether he misunderstood the question.

This attitude was unjustified. While the Board controls the procedure, it cannot prevent a counsel from representing his or her client unless the representation involves irresponsible undue repetition or irrelevant material. That was not the case here. Credibility remained an issue, and Mr. Rowe was concerned that the Board not misinterpret the PIF to the applicant's disadvantage. His concern stemmed in part from the fact that he had not prepared the PIF. Accordingly, he was entitled to examine on the full PIF without suffering repercussions."], ["[20]", "It is clear that the Board's normal day ends at approximately 4:30 p.m. In these circumstances, unless the Board gave reasonable notice of its intention to sit late or unless, as is often the case, all parties consented, or unless the Board explored Mr. Rowe's reasons for leaving and found them to be insufficient, the Board was not entitled to force the matter on until 6:00 p.m. This is particularly so given that cross-examination by the Refugee Claimant Officer (the \"RCO\"), the Board's questions, re-examination and submissions were all outstanding. In these circumstances, it was unlikely that the hearing would have been finished by 6:00 p.m. in any event. The transcript discloses that the Board recognized this fact."], ["[21]", "The Board displayed a serious lack of judgment when it proceeded with the abandonment proceedings at a time when it was still angry with Mr. Rowe. This may explain why it gave fairly short Notice of the Abandonment Hearing to the applicant and no notice to Mr. Rowe. These procedural choices seriously prejudiced the applicant's ability to proceed on the merits on February 10, 1998, either with Mr. Rowe or with another counsel. The result was that, at the Abandonment Hearing, the Board would very likely be able to order that the applicant's refugee claim had been abandoned.

As well, if the applicant was not ready, it is my opinion that the Board was responsible for the inadequate notice which made that situation a virtual certainty.

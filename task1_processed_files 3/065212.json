If there was a meeting, he would, as a member of the NHCN Council, be entitled to notice of the council meeting. He received no notice and affirms he learned Councillor Eric Apetagon was similarly unaware of BCR/050 until after it was signed."], ["[76]", "I conclude, on the evidence before me that no notice was given to all of the members of the NHCN Council for a meeting to consider BCR/050 on July 21, 2005."], ["[77]", "In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Blais, as he then was, strongly criticized the decision making processes used by the same NHCN Council in respect of other decisions.

He contends that when decisions are taken by the smaller group of councillors, the rules regarding quorum, notices and the recording of decisions and minutes are not respected.", "...", "49 ... I find that it is permissible for a sub-group of Band Council members to meet outside the formal confines of Band Council meeting to discuss issues concerning the Band. However, a distinction must be drawn between the latter and what has occurred in the present matter.", "That is, it is not permissible for the sub-group of Band councillors to make decisions in secret and subsequently have those decisions rubber stamped at future Band Council meetings without regard to the Band Council guidelines or the provisions of the Indian Act.", "[Emphasis added]"], ["[78]", "I agree with Justice Blais. A council decision cannot be validly made where not all the councillors were given notice of the meeting.

The minutes of the council meeting show Councillor Balfour was present and the merits of BCR/050 were debated before the vote ratifying it three to one. However, the decision does not mean BCR/050 was now properly ratified."], ["[80]", "Again, Justice Blais considered the same practice by the same NHCN Council and decided much the same issue in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . He stated:", "54 The respondents argue that they may ratify their resolutions at a later point in time at a duly convened meeting. I am satisfied, however, that in the present matter, the outcome of the ratification process was pre-determined in many situations. That is, resolutions drafted in secret meetings that did not respect the NHCN guidelines, often represented positions that were incapable of being changed. Further, the content of said resolutions was never circulated to the Band's members and properly debated at duly convened meetings and objectors were not given the opportunity to be heard.", "55", "I would like to emphasize that the ratification process mentioned by the respondents is a myth. Resolutions cannot be adopted in secret meetings, and then subsequently ratified at a duly convened meeting without being discussed and debated. The resolution itself must be passed at a duly convened meeting. It cannot be the product of a secret meeting and subsequently rubber stamped at a later date at a duly convened meeting.", "Resolutions cannot be the product of predetermined decisions. They must be debated and passed in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the Band and in accordance to the principles of democracy. In the present matter, there are many examples which illustrate that the ratification process of Band Council resolutions was inherently biased. ...

In fact, the vote was taken at the last Council meeting before the end of the NHCN Council's term of office."], ["[82]", "Since BCR/050 was presented to Canada and Manitoba Hydro as representing the official decision of the NHCN Council, which was then acted upon by them, the ratification process on February 7, 2006 could not be considered anything other than having been predetermined.

Such considerations will include any disproportionate impact on the parties or the interests of third parties. In my respectful opinion, that is the situation here. The focus of Mining Watch's interest as a public interest litigant is the legal point to which the declaration will respond.

Aside from the potential for adverse financial consequences, namely the return the monies paid, there is the question of the impact on the NHCN ability to do business in the future. NHCN Council decisions in the course of future dealings with government and corporations would be cast under a shadow of doubt as to their validity even if apparently valid in the face of the BCR. Given the import of such questions, it is essential to consider the position of the Respondent NHCN Council. Since the NHCN Council chose not to participate, that voice was not heard. I consider it unwise to decide such a question when the Respondent NHCN Council has not been heard."], ["[99]", "Finally, I note that BCR/050 was signed by the Chief and four Councillors out of the seven members of Council. That is five out of seven Councillors approved of BCR/050 while two Councillors had not. What was not observed was the procedural requirements for approving a NHCN Council resolution in accordance with the NHCN procedural regulations. When the matter was presented for ratification, a quorum of council was present and BCR/050 was approved by a vote of three to one. In all of this, it is apparent to me that a majority of the elected NHCN leadership at the relevant times were in favour of BCR/050.

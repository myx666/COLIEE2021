A council decision cannot be validly made where not all the councillors were given notice of the meeting.

I am satisfied, however, that in the present matter, the outcome of the ratification process was pre-determined in many situations. That is, resolutions drafted in secret meetings that did not respect the NHCN guidelines, often represented positions that were incapable of being changed. Further, the content of said resolutions was never circulated to the Band's members and properly debated at duly convened meetings and objectors were not given the opportunity to be heard.", "55", "I would like to emphasize that the ratification process mentioned by the respondents is a myth. Resolutions cannot be adopted in secret meetings, and then subsequently ratified at a duly convened meeting without being discussed and debated. The resolution itself must be passed at a duly convened meeting. It cannot be the product of a secret meeting and subsequently rubber stamped at a later date at a duly convened meeting.", "Resolutions cannot be the product of predetermined decisions.

Such considerations will include any disproportionate impact on the parties or the interests of third parties. In my respectful opinion, that is the situation here. The focus of Mining Watch's interest as a public interest litigant is the legal point to which the declaration will respond.

Aside from the potential for adverse financial consequences, namely the return the monies paid, there is the question of the impact on the NHCN ability to do business in the future. NHCN Council decisions in the course of future dealings with government and corporations would be cast under a shadow of doubt as to their validity even if apparently valid in the face of the BCR. Given the import of such questions, it is essential to consider the position of the Respondent NHCN Council. Since the NHCN Council chose not to participate, that voice was not heard. I consider it unwise to decide such a question when the Respondent NHCN Council has not been heard."], ["[99]", "Finally, I note that BCR/050 was signed by the Chief and four Councillors out of the seven members of Council. That is five out of seven Councillors approved of BCR/050 while two Councillors had not. What was not observed was the procedural requirements for approving a NHCN Council resolution in accordance with the NHCN procedural regulations. When the matter was presented for ratification, a quorum of council was present and BCR/050 was approved by a vote of three to one. In all of this, it is apparent to me that a majority of the elected NHCN leadership at the relevant times were in favour of BCR/050.

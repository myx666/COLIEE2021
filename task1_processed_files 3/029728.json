She remained there, however, until November 2001 and even after her father himself moved to the USA in late 1999/early 2000. She stayed in Colombia in order to complete her university education there. At that time she was also involved in a radio show and claimed that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\"FARC\") began to threaten her due to certain statements she made on-air about their activities. She then went back to the USA and lived there illegally, although she did begin the process of applying to become a permanent resident.

In 1988, he was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and unlawful possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He was sentenced to 27 months in jail. He lost his permanent resident status and was deported to Colombia in 1991. In 1993, he illegally returned to the USA and re-established his relationship with his American spouse and they had a second child. They separated in 1997. In 2001, he met the female applicant.

There is also no question, as the Court held  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ", that the country of refuge can certainly decide not to exclude the perpetrator of a serious non-political crime who has already been convicted and has served his sentence.

First, it outlined that in Canada, trafficking a substance is an offence under subsection 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substance Act (\"CDSA\") and possession for the purpose of trafficking is likewise and offence under subsection 5(2) of the CDSA. As the substance in question was cocaine, a Schedule 1 drug, it noted that offences under the aforementioned sections of the CDSA are liable to indictment and are punishable under paragraph 5(3)(a) to imprisonment for life. As noted above, it further held that in the Canadian context, paragraph 465(1)(c) of the", "Criminal Code", "establishes that every person who conspires to commit such an offence is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to receive the same punishment as that to which an accused who is guilty of that offence would, on conviction, be liable. The Board thus concluded that the gravity of the punishment to which the male applicant would have been liable, had he committed the same crime in Canada, is sufficient to conclude that he committed a \"serious\" criminal offence. The Board also noted that the male applicant admitted that he committed the crimes for which he was arrested, charged, convicted and sentenced."], ["[14]", "Second, it considered the mode of prosecution, stating that the male applicant \"had committed a serious crime in the USA for which he was punished after he received a fair trial with legal representation\". Thirdly, it noted the penalty, the sentence of 27 months imprisonment, finding it to be lengthy and indicative of the gravity of the drug-related offences in the USA. It addressed the fourth factor by considering other facts like his loss of permanent residency status in the USA, his deportation to Colombia, an order not to re-enter the USA for 10 years and the fact that he re-entered the USA illegally and was living there illegally until coming to Canada in 2008."], ["[15]", "At the hearing, the applicant relied on the recent decision of Justice James Russell in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm.

I don't agree. The mitigating and aggravating circumstances referred to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "go to the nature of the crimes committed, not to what might later be considered as factors to be taken into account in determining whether the offender/claimant has been rehabilitated. Thus, for the purpose of determining whether the exclusion applies, it is not enough for a claimant to say he now regrets his behaviour and has turned his life around if his behaviour at the time it was committed constituted a serious non-political crime."], ["[17]", "Here, there was nothing put forward by the applicant upon which the Board could have evaluated the circumstances of the offences to determine whether they were more or less serious than they appeared to be on the face of his record."], ["[18]", "It is clear from its analysis as a whole that the Board properly analyzed the male applicant's case and determined that he did not rebut the presumption of seriousness so as not to be excluded pursuant to 1F(b)."], ["[19]", "Accordingly, the determination regarding exclusion was reasonable and defensible in respect of the facts and law:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 47;", "Flores", ", above, at para. 27.", "Was the board's decision with respect to the female applicant reasonable?"], ["[20]", "It was reasonable for the Board to conclude that the female applicant's failure to apply for asylum in the USA in 1999, together with her return to Colombia, the country where she allegedly feared persecution, is indicative of a lack of subjective fear in Colombia. This was further reinforced, as reasonably noted by the Board, by her father's decision not to leave Colombia with her and her mother in January 1999, especially since he was the prime target. The applicant claims she returned to Colombia to care for her sick father and to continue her education but she provided no documentary evidence to show that her father was ill and needed her assistance. Moreover, even after her father left Colombia, she stayed there until October 2001, participated in university programs while being allegedly threatened by the FARC.

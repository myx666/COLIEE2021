They applied for refugee protection on the basis of Mr. Roman's fear from members of Mexico's organized crime gangs. The RPD dismissed this claim on February 28, 2008.

After they entered Canada, the applicant mother began to experience violent physical and sexual abuse at the hands of Mr. Roman. The applicant mother attempted to separate from Mr. Roman by moving out of their shared bedroom in the same apartment but the abuse only intensified. The police became involved on at least one occasion which led to criminal charges being laid against Mr. Roman. Shortly after Mr. Roman filed his PRRA, the applicants fled to a shelter and submitted their own PRRA on different grounds.

The RPD cited", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Justice Mosley, for the proposition that the effectiveness of state protection in Mexico is a relevant, but not a determinative consideration in the assessment of state protection.

The Puebla Network of Family Development Agencies (DIF Puebla) and the state's Office of the Attorney General (PGJ) offer the most complete range of care and services. DIF Puebla operated programs at 24 violence prevention and victim assistance clinics (10 in the city of Puebla and 14 in the rest of the state). The centres handled 3,543 reported cases by providing legal as well as medical and psychological assistance to women and children. The number of interventions conducted by these clinics increased from 26,233 in 2005 to 29,501 in 2006. DIF Puebla also offers assistance and education through traveling aid units. In 2006, 15,541 people participated in activities offered by the traveling aid units (conferences, workshops, etc).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The RPD further found that there were seven state managed shelters for abused women in the applicants' state and ongoing training and awareness on the issue of domestic abuse.

When that state is a democratic society, such as Mexico, albeit one facing significant challenges with corruption and other criminality, the quality of the evidence necessary to rebut the presumption will be higher.

Since the applicants have never attempted to avail themselves of Mexico's state protection, the RPD had to compare the applicant mother's testimonial assessment of the state protection in Puebla against the specific documentary evidence which discussed state protection in Puebla.

A claimant cannot become a refugee in Canada because the police in Canada are more effective than in Mexico.

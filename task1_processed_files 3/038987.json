The connections with the country are essential to become a citizen, and satisfying the criteria would tend to show that connection, that Canada is effectively home.

Given that presence for 1,095 days would be required, that leaves Mrs. Olafimihan with merely 622 days of physical presence (56.8% of the norm), which results in a shortfall of 473 days. As for Mr. Olaoye Olafimihan, the numbers are very much similar. The Citizenship Judge found his absences to be for a total of 809 days (absent 55.4% of the time), which left a residency in Canada of 651 days. The shortfall out of the requirement of 1,095 days would be 444 days. The Minister had a slightly different calculation, suggesting that his absences were in the order of 827 days, instead of 809 which would have left a shortfall of 462 days. Either way, the respondents were physically present in Canada for less than fifty percent of the time over a period of four years.

The applicant contends that the cumulative effect of those mistakes, together with the evident answer to question 4, makes the decision unreasonable. I agree. They show that there was no continuous residency in Canada, which is at the heart of the", "Koo", "test."], ["[23]", "Considering the analysis done with respect to questions 1, 3 and 5, one is struck by the importance put by the Citizenship Judge on the reasons for those absences, as if that could constitute an adequate justification or proxy for actually continuous residency and living in Canada before one can apply to become a citizen of this country."], ["[24]", "Question one suggests that being present in Canada for a long period prior to recent absences is an indicia that someone has taken in elements of Canadian culture and has strong connections with the country. The person \"regularly, normally or customarily lives\" in Canada. The Citizenship Judge answers the question by emphasizing that business reasons had taken the respondents out of the country. He concludes his answer to the question by saying that \"(A)s a result of their work related absences, the applicant is short in the order of 473 days of the 1095 days required under the Act\". This cannot mask the evidence before him that the respondents were never even close to satisfying the first factor. As the evidence showed, there was not a long presence in Canada followed by recent absences. Ever since the respondents established their business venture, they have been frequently out of the country. Indeed, the numbers speak for themselves."], ["[25]", "The third question is, arguably, at the heart of the", "Koo", "test. It boils down to looking for evidence that Canada is home, as opposed to a place one visits. The Citizenship Judge rightly pointed out that the respondents have established their business in this country. Furthermore they pay income and property taxes in this country and own assets. Indeed, their three children are Canadian citizens and are established here. The difficulty remains that in the four years preceding their application for citizenship, the respondents have spent less than fifty percent of their time in Canada. Mrs. Olafimihan had 19 absences in the period under consideration. Mr. Olaoye Olafimihan had 24 such absences. Indeed, four and six of these absences respectively are said to be family-related."], ["[26]", "It is difficult to escape the conclusion that one merely visits when not even spending 50% of their time in that place. In the case of Mrs. Olafimihan, 57.4% of the four years, during 19 absences was spent abroad. As for Mr. Olaoye Olafimihan, his absences were even more frequent. That they would have considered Canada as a base of operation for their business endeavours is arguable. It is less so as to whether Canada is their home, at least sufficiently to claim for citizenship in this country. What makes this particularly troublesome is the fact that the pattern of their return to Canada showed that they did not come back for an extended period of time. It is one thing to be out of the country for a long period of time, such that an applicant would end up having been out for more than a year out of four because of that one long stay outside of the country. It is quite another to be literally in and out of Canada without residing in this country for extended periods of time to experience living in Canada. It is in that sense that it can be said that one is merely visiting. Which takes me to an examination of the fifth factor."], ["[27]", "The fifth question seeks to elicit if the absences are a \"clearly temporary situation\". Presumably one ought not to be penalized for having been a student abroad or accepting temporary employment during the four years preceding the application. Conversely, someone who has not spent extensive periods of time in Canada is less likely to have the Canadian experience that comes with rubbing elbows with Canadians which presumably is why the legislation has a residency requirement of 1,095 days over four years. The purpose of the residency requirement cannot be ignored. The response given by the Citizenship Judge is particularly puzzling. He concludes that the respondents are in a \"perpetual temporary situation\". Again, he tries to justify the state of affairs by the business imperatives facing the respondents. It would appear that the Citizenship Judge was of the view that the respondents' absences are always temporary because they always come back to Canada. As can be plainly seen, that does not address the question. The respondents are well short of 1,095 days not because they have been out of the country for a long but temporary period of time; rather they have been out of the country for more than fifty percent of the time because they have been in and out of the country, a situation that is not about to change."], ["[28]", "Finally, the applicant does not take issue with question four, but that is because the answer does not favour the respondents. This is not an insignificant factor as I have pointed out earlier. It is in fact the recognition that someone who falls short of the 1,095 days required under the legislation will have a tougher time establishing sufficient residency to be granted citizenship in Canada. Establishing residency for the purpose of citizenship requires showing attachment that comes with physical presence during the preceding four years. According to", "Koo", ", it is not impossible to show that attachment if less than 1,095 days have been spent in the country, but that demonstration is made more difficult as the number of days falls way short of the standard set in legislation."], ["[29]", "The picture that emerges from the examination of the six factors in this case is one where the Citizenship Judge substituted the requirements for physical attachment, as per paragraph 5(1)(", ") of the Act, for a justification of absences on the basis of business needs. By not properly addressing criteria devised in", "Koo", ", the Citizenship Judge creates in effect a different test. No weight is given to criterion 4 and criteria 1, 3 and 5 are in effect ignored. That is hardly satisfying the test. The decision under review reads as if the respondents should be made citizens of Canada because they deserve to be, given that they have built a successful business, which justifies absences beyond the norm. As pointed out in", "Koo", ", such is not the purpose of the Act. No doubt that the respondents are deserving individuals whose success ought to be applauded and it is understandable that the Citizenship Judge would have been sympathetic in the circumstances. However, such is not the issue.", "Conclusion"], ["[30]", "With great respect, the conclusions of the Citizenship Judge can only be seen as failing the test of reasonableness. His reasons for judgment do not satisfy the", "Koo", "test, the test which allows some flexibility from the so-called quantitative test which requires physical presence in Canada for at least 1,095 days out of the preceding 1,460 days. When four of the six criteria do not favour the respondents, and the respondents have spent less than fifty percent of their time in Canada, the conclusion can hardly be any other than they have failed the", "Koo", "test. That would appear to be the only rational outcome. At the end of the day, departing as significantly only because of business requirements does not meet the residency test devised in", "Koo", ", which is itself a departure, or a measure of flexibility, from the apparent requirements of the legislation. Indeed, Justice Reed acknowledged that reality in", "Koo", "at page 292:", "In some decisions it has been suggested that the changes in the", "Citizenship Act", "which were made in 1978 [S.C. 19776-77, c. 52, s. 128] lead to the conclusion that Parliament intended that physical presence for the whole three-year period was not required. This is said to be related to the removal from the Act of qualifications based on domicile. I have read the Parliamentary debates and committee proceedings of that period and can find nothing to substantiate that conclusion. Indeed, quite the contrary seems to be the case. The requirement of three-year residence within a four-year period seems to have been designed to allow for one year's physical absence during the four-year period. Certainly, the debates of the period suggest that physical presence in Canada for 1,095 days was contemplated as a minimum. In any event, as has been noted above, the jurisprudence which is now firmly entrenched does not require physical presence for the whole 1,095 days."], ["[31]", "As a result, the appeal is granted and the decisions of the Citizenship Judge are quashed.

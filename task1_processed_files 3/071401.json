The applicant's level of knowledge of the Catholic faith did not commensurate with someone who had been a Roman Catholic for three years. For example, the Board made note of the following (Board's decision, paras 19-28, for a complete list):", "a. The applicant displayed little knowledge of mass;", "b. He was asked about the reading of the Gospel by the priest. The applicant testified that the previous Sunday's reading was from Exodus.

The applicant answered that it represented the body of Jesus (transcript, Certified Tribunal Record, page 469, line 25). The Board found this answer to be incorrect.

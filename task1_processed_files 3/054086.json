The applicant was relieved \"temporarily\", of duties and was directed to report to his superior on a daily basis.

If they were, no purpose would have been served in this matter proceeding beyond the leave stage to production of the CRDD's record and an oral hearing on the merits. Having had the benefit of an opportunity to review the CRDD's record and to hear the oral submissions of counsel, I reach a different conclusion from that of my colleague. I conclude that the CRDD made no reviewable error in determining that the applicant was excluded from the definition \"Convention refugee\" and that therefore this application for judicial review must be dismissed. That is not to say that I conclude that everyone who happened to be a member of the Nigerian army or a regiment or platoon thereof at the relevant time falls within the ambit of article 1F(a) of the Convention. It is only to say that, on the facts of this matter, I conclude that the CRDD made no reviewable error in concluding that the applicant fell within the ambit of that paragraph of the article.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  pp. 326 and 327  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"On a standard of \"serious reasons for considering that ... he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity,\" I cannot see the appellant's case as even a borderline one. He was aware of a very large number of interrogations carried out by the military, on what may have been as much as a twice-weekly basis (following some 130-160 military engagements) during his 20 months of active service. He could never be classed as a simple on-looker, but was on all occasions a participating and knowing member of a military force, one of whose common objectives was the torture of prisoners to extract information. This was one of the things his army did, regularly and repeatedly, as he admitted. He was a part of the operation, even if he personally was in no sense a \"cheering section\". In other words, his presence at this number of incidents of persecution, coupled with his sharing in the common purpose of the military forces, clearly constitutes complicity. We need not define for purposes of this case, the moment at which complicity may be said to have been established, because this case is not to my mind near the borderline. The appellant was no innocent by-stander: he was an integral, albeit reluctant, part of the military enterprise that produced those terrible moments of collectively deliberate inhumanity. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "I am satisfied that much of the foregoing might be said of the applicant in this matter.

One of its \"common objectives\" was to retain political power unto itself and it was prepared to resort to whatever measures it considered necessary to achieve that objective.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "The evidence before the CRDD clearly established that the applicant voluntarily joined the military, that he was aware that it was prepared to resort to and did resort to inhumane measures to achieve one of its common objectives, and that he nonetheless remained a member of the Nigerian military for many years during which he had opportunities to disassociate himself. In the end, he only disassociated himself when he felt that he might be personally at risk. Once again in the words of Mr. Justice McGuigan, the applicant \"... was a part of the operation, even if he personally was in no sense a \"cheering section\".\" He shared in a fearful common purpose of the Nigerian military. That sharing, from no matter how remote an element of the military, and here the remoteness was not physical but merely operational, clearly constituted complicity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "Against the foregoing guidance provided by the Federal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ", I conclude that the CRDD made no reviewable error in concluding as it did on all of the evidence before it that the applicant was excluded from the definition \"Convention refugee\" by reason of article 1 F (a) of the Convention. That conclusion, of itself, was sufficient to support the CRDD's decision against the applicant.

She claims that ultimately her termination grievance is founded on a number of allegations of misconduct in the workplace by fellow federal public servants during the course of her employment.

This argument is unfounded, specifically considering many of the claimed acts of wrongdoing date back close to 30 years and on numerous occasions she has used grievance procedures to address them.

Regarding this point, I agree with the rationale of the defendant Crown. That is, there is no suggestion in the plaintiff's statement of claim that she attempted to draw attention to any \"government waste or abuse\", as described  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , within any of the departments she worked. Her claim focuses solely the allegation that she herself was mistreated."], ["[24]", "The special situation referred to in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  mentioned by the plaintiff, has to be distinguished from the present matter because the grievance procedure was completed and satisfactory to the applicant. Nevertheless the action was allowed to proceed on the basis that this was not a case where the dispute between the parties could be referred to adjudication under the Act or the collective agreement. In Vaughan,Justice Binnie, writing for the majority held at paragraphs 19 and 20:", "In Pleau (Litigation Guardian of) v. Canada (Attorney General) (1999), 182 D.L.R. (4th) 373 (N.S.C.A.), the plaintiff alleged that he suffered harassment because he reported \"what he believed to be evidence of misconduct in the operation of a government facility\" (p. 380).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), two employees in the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade complained of \"punitive steps\" taken by their superiors because they reported \"mismanagement and waste of taxpayers' money\" (para. 1) in respect of properties held abroad. In both cases, the actions were allowed to proceed.", "The courts were understandably reluctant to hold that in such cases the employees' only recourse was to grieve in a procedure internal to the very department they blew the whistle on, with the final decision resting in the hands of the person ultimately responsible for the running of the department under attack, namely the Deputy Minister (or designate). The judges concluded that at some point their complaints should be dealt with by an adjudicator independent of the department but that the PSSRA did not provide for it. In both cases, it was pointed out that the \"exclusivity\" language of ss. 91 to 96 of the PSSRA was weaker than the labour relations provision at issue in Weber. The legislative door had been left open enough for the judiciary to enter."], ["[25]", "Despite the fact that the grievance mechanism found in section 91 of the PSSRA does not allow for independent arbitration by an independent third-party in all situations, there is still the possibility for judicial review. In Assh, Justice Strayer defends the aforementioned process by stating at paragraph 12:", "Nor does this lead to any serious injustice. What it means is that once a grievance has been dealt with at the final level, and is not referable for adjudication, the grievor can seek judicial review in this Court of the final level grievance decision. This is not an illusory remedy. As was said by Evans J.A. in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.):", "136 Fourth, the availability of judicial review of an adverse final level decision on a grievance that cannot be referred to an adjudicator under section 92 provides external discipline for decision-makers, and brings an independent measure of quality control to both process and outcome. On an application for judicial review to the Trial Division under section 18.1 of the Federal Court Act, the Court can be asked to review the fairness of the administrative process, the rationality of material findings of fact[...]"], ["[26]", "The plaintiff herself has attempted to seek judicial review on more than one occasion of the decisions that resulted from internal grievance mechanisms.

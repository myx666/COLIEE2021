On three occasions between August 27, 2012, and November 22, 2012, the immigration officer sent a letter to the applicants notifying them that they needed to provide more information in support of their submissions.

Consequently, Laura is not a family member for the purposes of section 176 of the IRPR. Indeed, the immigration officer concluded that the applicant was 22 years old when her mother filed her application, that she was not studying full time, and that she had not proven that she had depended on her mother financially before having reached the age of 22. In addition, the officer clarified that she had examined possible humanitarian and compassionate considerations, but was not satisfied that such grounds existed.", "IV.", "Applicants' Arguments"], ["[9]", "The applicants submit that the immigration officer's decision is unreasonable, in particular because she failed to take important evidence into consideration, including an affidavit by Telma in which she explains her relationship with her daughter, as well as receipts indicating that the mother had transferred money to her daughter. The applicants further add that the immigration officer had discretion to reconsider her decision, but chose not to do so. Lastly, they contend that due to the particular circumstances of their application the immigration officer should have taken the best interest of the child, that is to say, of Laura, into account even if she was an adult at the time the application was filed.", "V.", "Respondent's Arguments"], ["[10]", "The respondent maintains that the decision is reasonable. Contrary to what the applicants claim, the immigration officer did examine the evidence that was before her, and the decision properly reflects the evidence as a whole. The onus was on the applicants to submit the necessary evidence to establish that Laura depended on her mother financially before she was 22 years of age and that she continued to depend on her, which they did not do. Nevertheless, the immigration officer, going beyond what was expected of her, invited the applicants, on three occasions, to complete their file by submitting additional evidence. The officer based her decision on the evidence that was before her at the time, and the applicants are relying on new evidence - explanations and documentary evidence - that should be excluded from the judicial review process. The respondent adds that even if the new evidence submitted by the applicants had been considered, it would only have shown that Laura depended on her brother rather than her mother."], ["[11]", "As for the concept of best interests of the child, the respondent notes that Laura is an adult who cannot be considered to be a child. A person who may satisfy the definition of \"dependent child\" does not necessarily benefit from a best interests of the child analysis. Similarly, the fact that a person has a physical or mental vulnerability which may be similar to that of a child does not mean that the person can be considered a child. Furthermore, the immigration officer examined the humanitarian and compassionate considerations that would have been favourable to Laura, but reasonably found that there were no such grounds in this case.", "VI.", "Applicants' Reply"], ["[12]", "In their reply, the applicants contend that, contrary to what the respondent may believe, this is not a family reunification application but a sponsorship application. They add that it is very difficult for Telma, who is recognized as a refugee, to provide documentation proving that she was supporting her daughter. The applicants further assert that the case law relied upon by the respondent is not applicable to this case because those decisions involved different circumstances; the context in this case is quite different. They further argue that some of the evidence, which, in their view, was wrongly overlooked by the immigration officer in her analysis, does not constitute new evidence and should be examined in this review. The applicants concluded their reply by reminding Canada that it should seek to save lives and protect people from persecution and that it has a duty to meet its international obligations regarding human rights and refugees.", "VII.", "Issues"], ["[13]", "This application raises two issues in dispute:", "1.

And, furthermore, it should be pointed out that the onus is on the applicant to provide the decision-maker with all of the pertinent information and documentation in an application in order to establish that the APR meets the statutory requirements (see, for example,", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[20]", "In this case, the applicants submit that the decision ignored certain pieces of important evidence, namely an affidavit on the relationship between the mother and her daughter as well as money- transfer receipts.

As a result, it would be difficult for the Court to consider evidence that was filed in the record by the applicant after the decision, particularly the evidence that was submitted with the application for reconsideration dated March 18, 2013. The court record and the immigration officer's notes in the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) shed more light on the situation. It appears from these notes that the applicants submitted practically no evidence in support of their submissions. Faced with a nearly empty file, the immigration officer, on her own initiative, requested additional information from the applicants, on three occasions, which would have allowed them to establish, inter alia, Laura's financial dependence on her mother. In response to these requests for additional information, the applicants provided letters and medical reports. It was only after having provided the applicants with three opportunities to complete their file that the officer made her decision rejecting the application."], ["[22]", "According to the CAIPS notes and the court record, the documents cited by the applicants - affidavits and receipts - were submitted in support of the application for reconsideration, that is to say, on March 22, 2013.

The record contained various medical reports and two letters, which in no way established that there existed a relationship of financial dependence between the daughter and her mother. Counsel for the applicants is asking that the new evidence be considered in this judicial review. It would be unfair to the immigration officer to do so. She asked for evidence of this dependence to be submitted on three occasions. The applicants submitted few documents. She therefore made her decision based on what was before her."], ["[24]", "This is why, given the little evidence in the record, it was entirely reasonable for the immigration officer to conclude that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Laura was financially dependent on her mother, which is an essential condition for an APR to be issued.", "B.", "Did the immigration officer err by not considering the best interests of the child, Laura, even if she was an adult at the time the application was submitted?"], ["[25]", "This Court finds that it was reasonable for the immigration officer not to examine the best interests of the child."], ["[26]", "The applicants, who claim otherwise, feel that Laura, even if she was an adult at the time the application was submitted, ought to have benefited from a best interests of the child analysis.

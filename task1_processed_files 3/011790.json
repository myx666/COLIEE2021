Further, while the claim of the amendments in this action was to reassess the royalties on a per capita basis, the claim being made by the same Plaintiffs in the 1993 action is for a 25% share of the royalties.

This calculation may not go beyond a redistribution but it is a recalculation nonetheless. This redistribution would require the involvement of the other Hobbema Bands whose share of the overall Pigeon Lake royalties for the years in question would be consequently reduced. Involving the other bands - and I believe it would be unrealistic and unreasonable to expect otherwise - would open up a \"can of worms\" related to the band lists of the other Hobbema Bands and to other royalty related issues. Managing this action in the face of these complexities would result in very real and substantial delays.

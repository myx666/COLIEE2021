Indeed, the PRRA emerged as a result of the jurisprudence of the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada, which required a timely risk assessment to comply with section 7 of the", "Charter", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It is clear that Parliament's primary intention in enacting the PRRA process was to comply with Canada's domestic and international commitments to the principle of non-refoulement,", "Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement", "to the", "IRPA Regulations", "Canada Gazette", ", Part I, December 15, 2001, pp. 4550, 4552). Subsection 115(1) of the", "IRPA", ", found in Division 3 - Pre-removal risk assessment which comprises sections 112 to 116 of the", "IRPA", ", assures that a person shall not be removed from Canada to a country where they would be at risk of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Naturally, this statutory right is subject to the exceptions mentioned at subsection 115(2) of the", "IRPA", "(however, for the purposes of the present case, it is not necessary to determine whether such exceptions contravene section 7 of the", "Charter", "). Accordingly, the PRRA is closely linked in time to removals and is carried out immediately prior to removal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"¶ 41 The fact that PRRA applicants receive a statutory stay of removal under section 232 of the", "IRPA Regulations", "is indicative of the legislative intent to have PRRAs completed before applicants are to be returned to face the risks they allege. The PRRA's fundamental purpose is to determine whether or not a person can safely be removed from Canada without being subject to persecution, torture or inhumane treatment. This purpose ceases to exist upon removal. ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "In other words, the purpose of the PRRA is to prevent a foreign national whose refugee claim has already been rejected from being required to return to his country of residence or citizenship when the situation has changed in that country and he would be exposed to a risk of persecution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "In my opinion, if this review is to be effective and consistent with Parliament's intention when creating it, the PRRA must coincide as closely as possible with the person's departure from the country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "In fact, this is demonstrated by the factors set out in the", "CIC Removals Enforcement Manual", "(the Manual) (section 15.4) for determining the appropriate time to notify the persons. These factors are grouped around the person's ability to leave the country (e.g. if he or she has a valid travel document), as an indication of intention, in which case the PRRA decision should be issued at the time when the person in question is likely to leave Canada, or at least at some time that is close to it. The Manual provides:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"15.4.", "When to notify a person to apply for a PRRA  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "There are several trigger points that could decide the timing of the notification for a person to submit a PRRA application. Based on a review of the case and the availability of travel documents, an officer should determine when it would be the most appropriate time to notify the person of the opportunity to apply for a PRRA. Notification can be done either by mail or in person. This decision is at the discretion of the officer based on an assessment of the case. It is highly recommended that notification be given in person in the majority of cases.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The following circumstances include examples of trigger points that officers should consider when assessing the timing for notifying the person to submit a PRRA application:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- a valid travel document is available;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- an expired travel document or valid identity or birth record is available and a Canada Immigration Single Journey Document [IMM 5149B] can be used;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- there is no valid travel document, an application for one has been submitted, the respective embassy or mission has approved the application in principle and the travel document is forthcoming; or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- there is no valid travel document and an application is completed and will be submitted to the embassy or mission.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Although these trigger points are not exhaustive, the officer preparing the file for removal should be able to judge whether the case is removal-ready through experience and consultation with a supervisor, if required. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "The Manual is important from the fairness standpoint, therefore. The policy adopted by the respondent is clearly not arbitrary and is not based on irrelevant considerations, which could make the discretionary decision unfair. On the contrary, the criteria in section 15.4 of the Manual, which contemplate the issuance of a notice once the possibility of a departure is in principle confirmed, are consistent with the objective of the PRRA procedure described above.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "Moreover, the Manual also establishes that \"there is no legitimate expectation affecting the content of the duty of fairness\" (", "Baker", ", supra, at p. 841). Indeed, a person cannot expect to receive the PRRA notice before the DO becomes a deportation order since this not usual practice for an administrative decision-maker who must consider a number of factors before determining the appropriate time, and those factors may vary in the assessment of each case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "I recognize that the delay created by this process generally has the effect of delaying the sending of the notice after the DO has become a deportation order. However, I do not think this situation is unfair to a person.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "The statutory scheme as a whole, again in my opinion, reduces the value of this proposition. Providing crucial safeguards such as the PRRA process, on the one hand, in addition to the ordinary refugee claim process, there is an important interest in guaranteeing that the statutory framework will be effective and generally respected. This interest is reflected in the objectives of the", "Act", ", which, among numerous undertakings to fulfill international obligations and promote human rights by protecting refugees, include the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"3(1) The objectives of this Act with respect to immigration are  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ". . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(f) to support, by means of consistent standards and prompt processing, the attainment of immigration goals established by the Government of Canada in consultation with the provinces;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ". . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"3(2) The objectives of this Act with respect to refugees are  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ". . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(e) to establish fair and efficient procedures that will maintain the integrity of the Canadian refugee protection system, while upholding Canada's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "Some provisions designed to secure voluntary compliance with the", "Act", "and the", "Regulations", "are an integral part of this important interest.

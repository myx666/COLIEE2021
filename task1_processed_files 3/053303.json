After her visitor's visa expired, she remained in Canada without lawful status. In the course of her stay here she has received a negative determination in respect of a refugee claim, a negative decision in respect of a humanitarian and compassionate (\"H & C\") application, and a negative pre-removal risk assessment (\"PRRA\").

In October of 2004, the application was amended at Ms. Alexander's request to include a claim for custody of Crystal and a request for an order prohibiting the removal of the children from Ontario. Ms. Alexander admits that, knowing that she faced removal from Canada, the non-removal order was sought by her in order to assist her efforts to keep her together with her children in Canada. There is no evidence of any pending custody dispute with the father of either child that led to the court application. Ms. Alexander had not heard from the father of Crystal after he learned she was pregnant and had been unable to locate him. Dameon's father had ended his relationship with Ms. Alexander when he learned she was pregnant. He responded to the Court proceedings by denying paternity. As set out in more detail at paragraph 83, Ms. Alexander was reported by the media to admit that she sought the non-removal order in order to force immigration officials into deferring her removal from Canada pending a new application for landing from within Canada."], ["[5]", "On October 27, 2004, as a result of her application, the Ontario Court of Justice issued an interim order granting Ms. Alexander sole custody of both of her children. The order also provided that the children not be removed from the province of Ontario without further order of that Court. The operative portions of the Court's order are set out in Appendix A to these reasons. While the Minister was served with the motions materials that gave rise to that order, and so was given the opportunity to make submissions before the Ontario Court of Justice, the Minister was not represented at the hearing and so made no submissions to the Court.

Given that the best interests of a child will almost always favour the non-removal of a parent from Canada, and yet, as a matter of law, the presence of a child in Canada is not, by itself, to be an absolute impediment to the removal of a parent, I find that the interpretation of s. 50(a) of the", "Act", "urged by Ms. Alexander is contrary to the overall scheme of the", "Act", ".

It follows, she says, that if she is removed from Canada her children must go with her, and this would remove them from Ontario in direct contravention of the relevant orders. However, I am unable to conclude that the grant of custody, or sole custody, necessitates that the custodial parent maintain physical care of a child at all times.

To 'read in' such a mandate at the removals stage would, in effect, result in a 'pre H & C' application, which in my opinion, is not what the law requires. Section 48 of the", "Immigration Act", "provides the following: 'Subject to ss. 49 and 50, a removal order shall be executed as soon as reasonably practicable.'

In deciding when it is 'reasonably practicable' for a removal order to be executed, a removal officer may consider various factors such as illness, other impediments to traveling, and pending H & C applications that were brought on a timely basis but have yet to be resolved due to backlogs in the system. [See Note 7 below] For instance, in this case, the removal of the Applicant scheduled for May 10, 2000 was deferred due to medical reasons, and was rescheduled for May 31, 2000. Furthermore, in my view, it was within the removal officer's discretion to defer removal until the Applicant's eight-year old child terminated her school year.

In short, one would need only have a child on Canadian soil and argue that child's Canadian citizenship rights in order to avoid the effect of Canadian immigration laws and obtain indirectly what it was impossible to obtain directly by complying with those laws.'", "\"Moreover, with respect to separating children from their parents, the Court of Appeal stated the following at page 234:", "'... a child has no constitutional right never to be separated from its parents:", "we need only consider imprisonment, extradition, and even divorce, for confirmation that the child's right is to be where its best interests require it to be, and it is not necessarily in a child's best interests to be in the company of its parents.'\" (Footnotes omitted, underlining added)"], ["[67]", "Second, the purpose served by the requirement of reasons must be considered.

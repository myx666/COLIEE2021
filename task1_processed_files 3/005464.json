Just as a court will only defer to an agency's interpretation of its constituent statute if it provides reasons for its conclusion, so a court will be reluctant to defer to an agency's factual determinations in the absence of express findings, and an analysis of the evidence that shows how the agency reached its result.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16] On the other hand, the reasons given by administrative agencies are not to be read hypercritically by a court (", "Medina", ". Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)", "(1990), 12 Imm. L.R. (2d) 33 (F.C.A.)), nor are agencies required to refer to every piece of evidence that they received that is contrary to their finding, and to explain how they dealt with it (see, for example,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). That would be far too onerous a burden to impose upon administrative decision-makers who may be struggling with a heavy case-load and inadequate resources. A statement by the agency in its reasons for decision that, in making its findings, it considered all the evidence before it, will often suffice to assure the parties, and a reviewing court, that the agency directed itself to the totality of the evidence when making its findings of fact.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17] However, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact \"without regard to the evidence\":", "Bains", ". Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)", ", (1993), 63 F.T.R. 312 (F.C.T.D.). In other words, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts. Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact. Moreover, when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion, it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "Given the importance of Mr. Ranji's personal circumstances, the failure of the officer to reference them in her decision leads me to conclude that the officer failed to consider them when assessing his establishment.

The following passage from the report relates to the age group of the Applicant's children.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The constitution provides for free, compulsory education for children between the ages of six and 14 years of age. However, the government did not enforce this provision. In practice, children in poor and rural areas often did not attend school.

In 2006, she was offered and accepted a temporary promotion to an acting assignment in an excluded EX-01 position. She claims that the workload in that position was excessive and that she was subjected to ongoing harassment by the supervisor to whom she reported in the acting assignment. Matters came to a head in April 2008, when the supervisor swore and shouted at Ms. Chamberlain. She alleges that he was also physically intimidating and on other occasions had made comments to her that she found to be sexually suggestive and inappropriate."], ["[2]", "In April 2008, Ms. Chamberlain made a complaint to the Assistant Deputy Minster [ADM] to whom her supervisor reported.

The ADM investigated Ms. Chamberlain's complaint and concluded that Ms. Chamberlain's supervisor had violated the Treasury Board Harassment Policy. Ms. Chamberlain, however, was not satisfied with the investigation report and has been engaged in a lengthy debate about it with HRSDC. Indeed, the correspondence between Ms. Chamberlain, her co-workers and HRSDC spawned the record before the Court in this application, which consists of 14 bound volumes of documentation."], ["[3]", "Ms. Chamberlain's acting assignment in the EX-01 position ended on its originally scheduled end-date of October 6, 2008, although she was absent due to illness at the time. HRSDC has offered to return Ms. Chamberlain to her substantive position of ES-07 in another branch of HRSDC, but Ms. Chamberlain claims that due to her medical condition she cannot work in the locations that have been made available. She also argues that she ought to continue to be paid at the EX-01 level and alleges that she was effectively blocked from competing for promised vacancies at the EX-01 level because her former supervisor, about whom she complained, ran the competitions for these positions."], ["[4]", "On December 3, 2008, Ms. Chamberlain filed a grievance in which she complained about several matters, including the treatment she had received from her supervisor, the investigation conducted by the ADM, the contents of the investigation report, her inability to compete for the posted EX-01 positions and loss of the EX-01 salary, HRSDC's alleged disregard of its obligation to ensure her health and safety in accordance with Part II of the", "Canada Labour Code", ", RSC, 1985, c L-2) [the Code], the alleged failure of HRSDC to accommodate her and the discrimination she claims to have faced as a woman, a member of a visible minority group and a person with a disability. Ms. Chamberlain referred her grievance to adjudication under the", "Public Service Labour Relations Act", ", SC 2003, c 22, s 2 [PSLRA or the Act].

I therefore can only consider the portions of Mr. Filliter's decision which disposed of Ms. Chamberlain's grievance.

She first alleges that the Adjudicator erred in finding that the grievance is not related to a disciplinary action resulting in demotion or financial penalty within the meaning of paragraph 209(1)(b) of the PSLRA. Second, she attacks the Adjudicator's dismissal of her grievance, arguing that she asserted human rights violations which the Adjudicator should have found to be adjudicable. Finally, she makes a number of allegations that are in essence a repetition of her claims concerning the errors she believes the Adjudicator made in ruling on her complaints under the Code, or, indeed, that relate to the merits of the Code-based claims that the PSLRB is still adjudicating."], ["[10]", "The final category of error is not appropriately raised in this application for judicial review as it is outside this Court's jurisdiction. Moreover, it was already ruled upon in part by the Federal Court of Appeal and in other part is the subject of an ongoing proceeding before the PSLRB.

Although these claims are not clearly stated, Ms. Chamberlain does allege in her grievance that she was a victim of discrimination and that the employer failed to facilitate her return to work. She also mentions the CHRA. The Adjudicator did not consider the adjudicability of the alleged violations of the CHRA in his decision and thus, as is more fully discussed below, committed a reviewable error. It may well be that Ms. Chamberlain's human rights claims are inadjudicable, but this matter was not addressed by the Adjudicator and should have been. I have accordingly determined that the Adjudicator's order dismissing Ms. Chamberlain's grievance must be set aside and the matter be remitted back to him (if he is available or to another PSLRB adjudicator if he is not) to determine whether or not Ms. Chamberlain's claim of an alleged breach of the CHRA is adjudicable under the PSLRA. As the standard of review of an Adjudicator's determination of arbitrability is reasonableness, it is for the Adjudicator - and not this Court - to make this determination."], ["[13]", "At the hearing of this matter, two evidentiary issues were raised.

In both proceedings, she alleged that she was not provided with the opportunity to present her case in full, that her evidence and cited jurisprudence were not sufficiently considered and that the Adjudicator did not issue summons to witnesses whom Ms. Chamberlain wished to call.

The Court summarized the applicable principles in the following way:", "• It is in the interests of the public and the parties that the finality of a decision can be relied on.", "• Respect for the finality of a judicial or administrative decision increases fairness and the integrity of the courts, administrative tribunals and the administration of justice; on the other hand, re-litigation of issues that have been previously decided in an appropriate forum may undermine confidence in this fairness and integrity by creating inconsistent results and unnecessarily duplicative proceedings.", "• The method of challenging the validity or correctness of a judicial or administrative decision should be through the appeal or judicial review mechanisms that are intended by the legislature.", "• Parties should not circumvent the appropriate review mechanism by using other forums to challenge a judicial or administrative decision.", "• Avoiding unnecessary re-litigation avoids an unnecessary expenditure of resources.", "BC Workers", "at para 34, citations omitted.]"], ["[24]", "All the elements necessary for the doctrine of issue estoppel are present in this case.

Neither of these acts was taken as a result of any misconduct by Ms. Chamberlain; nor were they designed to punish or correct her. The Adjudicator similarly held that the ADM's investigation report was not a disciplinary action, that requiring Ms. Chamberlain to utilize her sick leave was not disciplinary, and that refusing to allow an employee to participate in second language training, absent other evidence of a disciplinary intent, is not disciplinary action.

Each of these arguments is discussed below."], ["[55]", "Dealing with the first, it will be recalled that paragraph 209(1)(b) of the PSLRA requires that an adjudicable grievance relate to a disciplinary action that results in termination, demotion, suspension or financial penalty. On the facts of Ms. Chamberlain's situation, only demotion or financial penalty could pertain. For her situation to come within the scope of paragraph 209(1)(b) of the PSLRA, however, it is not enough for Ms. Chamberlain to have been placed in a lower-rated position or to have suffered a financial loss.

Where the employee's behaviour is culpable or where the employer's intent is to correct or punish misconduct, an action generally will be viewed as disciplinary.

As noted, it is not enough that she suffered a financial loss in order for her claim to fall within the scope of paragraph 209(1)(b) of the PSLRA; rather, such loss must also be tied to a disciplinary action on the part of the employer to render her claim adjudicable. There is no such action alleged in the grievance."], ["[59]", "Likewise, the Adjudicator's determination that the circumstances giving rise to the grievance did not disclose a situation of disguised discipline is also reasonable. Ms. Chamberlain did not engage in any misconduct and none was alleged against her. Nor was there any evidence of intent on the part of HRSDC to punish or correct Ms. Chamberlain. Indeed, the ADM's investigation concluded that Ms. Chamberlain's supervisor had engaged in inappropriate behaviour, thus vindicating Ms. Chamberlain's position. In the face of this fact, it is not surprising to find the absence of any intent to punish or correct Ms. Chamberlain. Furthermore, there was no evidence of any act taken by HRSDC akin to a disciplinary sanction. Ms. Chamberlain was not demoted for reasons related to poor performance, but, rather, her acting assignment came to its planned conclusion, and no new EX-1 position was offered to her.

This determination supports the respondent's position. The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision is likewise distinguishable from Ms. Chamberlain's situation.

In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the grievor was demoted due to his lack of productivity. The adjudicator in that case found the demotion to not be disciplinary because it was based on the employer's legitimate operational requirements as opposed to a desire to punish or correct the grievor.

There is authority to suggest that the limitation of jurisdiction contained in subsection 209(1) of the PSLRA does not remove jurisdiction to consider a grievance alleging a human rights violation even if the grievor's claims do not fall within one of the enumerated grounds listed in subsection 209(1) of the PSLRA."], ["[76]", "In this regard, in", "Parry  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [", "Parry Sound", "], the Supreme Court of Canada was called upon to determine whether a provision in the Ontario", "Labour Relations Act", ", 1995, SO 1995, c 1, Sch A [OLRA], similar to paragraph 226(1)(g) of the PSLRA, afforded a grievance arbitrator jurisdiction to adjudicate upon human rights claims that arose independently from the provisions of the collective agreement. The Court determined that it did. In", "Parry Sound", ", the employer terminated the employment of a probationary employee who had gone on maternity leave, and she grieved, alleging that the dismissal was motivated by improper discrimination in violation of Ontario human rights legislation. The collective agreement that governed her employment did not contain an anti-discrimination provision and moreover provided that a managerial decision to release a probationary employee was not arbitrable. Despite this, the Supreme Court concluded that the arbitrator was correct in assuming jurisdiction over the employee's grievance because he was empowered to do so, at least in part, by reason of a provision in the OLRA similar to paragraph 226(1)(g) of the PSLRA. In other words, jurisdiction flowed not from the usual jurisdiction-granting provisions in the statute (that hinge on a violation of the collective agreement) but, rather, at least in part, from a remedial provision akin to paragraph 226(1)(g) of the PSLRA. Justice Iacobucci, writing for the majority, noted that there are important policy considerations that militate in favour of granting labour arbitrators jurisdiction over unionized employees' human rights claims. These include improving access to justice and ensuring the expeditious resolution of all workplace disputes (see paras 50 to 54). Arguably, similar reasoning could be applied to the PSLRA."], ["[77]", "A somewhat similar issue arose in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], where the Supreme Court was called upon to rule on the jurisdiction of the PSLRB to adjudicate the human rights claims of a terminated parliamentary employee, under another statute, the", "Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act", ", RSC 1985, c 33 (2nd Supp), s 2 [PESRA]. In many respects, PESRA is similar to the PSLRA, and, in particular, contains provisions similar to sections 208 to 210 of the PSLRA. Thus, both statutes provide a limitation on the types of matters which may be referred to adjudication, which are narrower than the types of issues that may be grieved. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court found that Mr. Vaid's complaint that he was laid off due to ethnicity, in violation of the CHRA, was adjudicable by the PSLRB."], ["[78]", "These decisions are very much in keeping with the direction in which modern labour law has progressed, which has been to extend the jurisdiction of labour tribunals to hear all workplace disputes. Thus, claims that arise directly or inferentially from an alleged breach of a collective agreement must be determined by a labour tribunal and not by the courts (see e.g.", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and the multitude of other cases that have applied", "Weber", ")."], ["[79]", "As counsel for the respondent conceded, the case law has not yet definitively determined whether the PSLRB possesses jurisdiction to adjudicate human rights claims in cases like that of Ms. Chamberlain. Certain decisions of the PSLRB suggest such jurisdiction does exist. For example, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Adjudicator Filliter took jurisdiction in a situation where the grievor claimed that the employer's decision to not extend his term contract was made for discriminatory reasons in violation of the CHRA. Adjudicator Filliter noted in this regard that the provisions of subsection of 226(1)(g) of the PSLRA were \"important in [his] deliberations\" (at para 10). In result, though, he dismissed the grievance on the merits."], ["[80]", "To similar effect, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Adjudicator Mackenzie concluded that he possessed jurisdiction over a grievance that alleged the employee had been terminated in violation of an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement and also in violation of the CHRA. In finding that he had jurisdiction over the claims, Adjudicator Mackenzie held that the provisions in subsection 208(2) and paragraphs 226(1)(g) and (h) of the PSLRA afford PSLRB adjudicators jurisdiction over claims of breach of the CHRA that arise independently from the collective agreement. He noted that it was \"clear from the statutory provisions that it was not intended that employment matters in the federal public service be needlessly bifurcated\" (at para 22)."], ["[81]", "There is, however, at least one conflicting decision from the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Adjudicator Butler found he did not possess jurisdiction over claims of a violation of the CHRA. In so ruling, however, he did not consider the impact of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in", "Parry Sound", "and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (cited above at paras 76 and 77)."], ["[82]", "In light of the foregoing, it is arguable that Ms. Chamberlain's claims of violation of her human rights were adjudicable. The adjudicator, however, failed to address this issue in the decision under review, possibly because Ms. Chamberlain raised a myriad of other issues and did not articulate this issue clearly. Be that as it may, a tribunal's failure to address an issue raised by a grievance or a complaint does give rise to reviewable error because in such circumstance the tribunal fails to exercise its jurisdiction and has not decided the matters before it. In this regard, as noted, in", "Turner", "(cited above at para 27), in circumstances much like the present, the Federal Court of Appeal remitted a matter to the Human Rights Tribunal when it erred in failing to address an issue that was raised in a complaint. Similarly, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 528, Justice Russell of this Court quashed a decision of the Pension Appeals Board because he found the Board to have committed an error of law in not considering issues raised by the applicant. Similar conclusions were reached in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 229."], ["[83]", "Thus, the Adjudicator made a reviewable error in failing to determine whether Ms. Chamberlain's human rights claims were adjudicable.

However, in failing to even", "consider", "this issue, the Adjudicator erred.", "What remedy is appropriate?"], ["[84]", "As discussed above, it is the role of the Adjudicator, not this Court, to determine whether the human rights claims raised by Ms. Chamberlain's claim are adjudicable because the PSLRB is to be afforded deference in its determinations on arbitrability. As such, this matter will be remitted back to Mr. Filliter (if he is available, or to another adjudicator if he is not) for the consideration of whether a PSLRB adjudicator possesses jurisdiction to adjudicate upon Ms. Chamberlain's human rights claims, and if so, to hear and decide those claims on their merits.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[85]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "1.

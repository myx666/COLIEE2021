Tang claimed that he was not a member because he had not gone through a traditional initiation ceremony.

The officials also advised that, as the responsible officer had left government service, it was necessary to reassess the application by a new decision-maker.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The internal communication between officials described Tang's file as \"well travelled\". The initial problem, identified in 1998, was confusion of responsibility between the New York and Hong Kong offices.

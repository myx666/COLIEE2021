After an interview in August 2001, the Applicants' sister was granted a visa and she came to Canada, where she now lives.

Officer Blouin added that the Applicants had confirmed during their interviews that they knew that the individuals they had denounced would be detained, brutalized and possibly killed without any form of fair trial. After briefly noting that credible governmental and non-governmental organizations had documented systematic human rights violations committed by the ECOMOG and their collaborators, including the CDU, during the conflict in Sierra Leone, Officer Blouin concluded that the Applicants were complicit in crimes against humanity and were thus inadmissible under section 35(1)(a) of the", "IRPA", ".

Analysis", "A.", "Did the officer err in failing to consider the letter from the lawyer who had provided representations in response to the fairness letter?"], ["[24]", "The applicants submit that the officer erred by not considering the response because the lawyer had clearly indicated that the applicants intended to respond to the fairness letter and to provide an explanation for the officer's concerns. The officer concluded that in order for the response to be considered, there had to be a Representative Form signed by the applicants. However, such a requirement is only stipulated in the Manual, a policy document, and nowhere in the Act or Regulations. The response complied with the legislation by providing the lawyer's details and it was clear that he was responding to the procedural fairness letter. The applicants contend that there is no dispute that the lawyer was retained for the purpose of responding to the officer's concerns or that he submitted material information that should have been considered. In the alternative, the applicants submit that the officer breached the duty of fairness by failing to give notice that the response would not be considered and that it was unreasonable for the officer to refuse the application instead of advising the applicants or their counsel that a Representative Form signed by the applicants should be submitted, given the context of this being a final decision."], ["[25]", "The respondent submits that it is \"entirely reasonable for CIC to require some indication from the applicants themselves that the lawyer is representing them.\" The onus was on the applicants and they were not entitled to a running score of the status of their application, so the officer was not obliged to give them notice of the issue with the Representative Form. In the alternative, if the Court were to find that the lack of notice was a breach of procedural fairness, the respondent submits that the applicants have failed to show how the ultimate decision would have been different if the officer had considered the response because the letter does not make any submissions about how or why the visa refusal was not material in the applicants' case."], ["[26]", "I agree with the applicants that there was a failure of natural justice by the refusal of the officer to advise their lawyer that the Representation Form was not enclosed and that a similar form signed by the applicants would also be necessary. On the other hand, I also accept the respondent's argument that the failure to consider the response of the sponsor and applicants' lawyer would not have impacted on the decision in any manner."], ["[27]", "I acknowledge that there do not appear to be any provisions in the Act or Regulations stipulating a requirement for a Representation Form whereby a party retains a representative to speak on his or her behalf. Nonetheless, it should be understood that not everything the CIC requests of claimants has to be prescribed in some statutory form. The CIC may adopt general practices normally followed by organizations in the operations of its daily affairs. The requirement that there be some form of official retainer by one person permitting another to represent his or her interests is a normal precautionary practice required to protect the organization from subsequent allegations that the representative was not authorized to represent the alleged principal. Failing the provision of such a form, CIC was entitled to refuse to consider the representative's submissions."], ["[28]", "Despite CIC's entitlement to demand a signed Representation Form from a purported representative, I conclude that in exercising its discretion in the special circumstances surrounding the requirement to provide a fairness letter, a CIC delegate may have to take the extra step to permit representations to be made if it is obvious that some slip or other innocent misunderstanding occurred that prevented receipt of the form. Thus, when discharging its duty to act fairly in obtaining representations from claimants, and faced with situations such as a missing enclosure or a misunderstanding as to the persons covered by a Representation Form, and where the administrative requirements are minor in nature, the officer should provide the claimants with an opportunity to correct the technical error or omission in order to obtain their representations."], ["[29]", "In decision-making, reasonableness underlies fairness by playing a role in improving the correctness, reliability, and legitimacy of decisions. It has been found that if persons affected by decisions do not have an opportunity to participate in the decision-making process, the decision may more often be defective (i.e. not correct, reliable or legitimate). Seen from this perspective, the officer should have understood that it was in her best interests in carrying out her functions to hear from the applicants to enhance the well-foundedness and legitimacy of the decision when patently obvious minor errors or omissions stand in the way."], ["[30]", "Reasonableness underlying fairness is also based on expectations. Norms of conduct develop and persons come to rely upon them. One of those norms that normally applies is that obvious slips and omissions will not be automatically fatal and may be corrected. For example, the failure to include an attachment to an email raises the expectation that the addressee will advise the sender of his or her error. Similarly, when the substantive interests of the sponsor and the applicant are identical, unless there are protracted administrative steps required, the officer should seek to correct the innocent misunderstanding. In this case, the officer ought to have notified the applicants about the missing enclosure and sought to clarify the confusion on the authority arising from the fact that the sponsor had signed the Representative Form."], ["[31]", "Accordingly, if the matter turned on the refusal of the officer to consider the representations of the sponsor's lawyer due to the technical omissions described, I would have set aside the decision and required it to be reconsidered by another officer. However, I do not find that the submissions of the sponsor's lawyer would have impacted in any manner on the officer's ultimate decision, for reasons which are described below.", "B.", "Did the officer err by finding that the applicants engaged in misrepresentation and were therefore inadmissible pursuant to section 40(1) of the Act?"], ["[32]", "It is common ground that two factors must be present for a finding of inadmissibility under section 40(1) of the Act: there must be misrepresentations by the applicant and those misrepresentations must be material in that they could have induced an error in the administration of the IRPAREFERENCE_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[33]", "The applicants submit that the officer's conclusion regarding the misrepresentation is unreasonable in light of the evidence that was before him or her and the officer's own investigation into the reasons behind the visa refusal.

However, the facts in that case are clearly distinguishable, inasmuch as there was considerable confusion surrounding past applications and their updating. Moreover, the fact that the applicants had been refused past temporary visas had already been described in other documents in the officer's files, which demonstrated that there was no intention to conceal the fact. The information was also found not to be material, which appears to have been a factor in the overall decision in respect of the visas and other dated employment information."], ["[36]", "I conclude that the son committed a misrepresentation in failing to identify on the background declaration that he had been refused a visa. This decision is not impacted by the refusal of the officer to consider the submissions of the applicant's lawyer, or any analysis on the part of the officer. It results from the application of previous jurisprudence to the facts."], ["[37]", "The second issue is whether the misrepresentation was material. Paragraph 40(1)(", ") of the IRPA states that a foreign national will be inadmissible if they directly or indirectly misrepresent or withhold material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or that could induce an error in the administration of the IRPA. A misrepresentation will be material if it is important enough to affect the process. Moreover it is not necessary that a misrepresentation actually induces an error, it is enough that it could do so (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[38]", "The applicants submit that, prior to the misrepresentation being detected, there was no issue as to their admissibility based on the extensive medical, criminal, and security background checks that had already been performed in Sri Lanka. However, obtaining a security clearance in one country would not disentitle the officer from investigating why the son was refused entry to India. As described in the GCMS notes, it was generally rare that a Sri Lankan would be refused a visa to India, especially in the timeframe of the month surrounding the end of the Civil War. I find that this gave rise to a reasonable concern that the officer could properly act upon."], ["[39]", "The applicants further submit that it is unclear what information could have been obtained or investigated by CIC given the fact that the Indian authorities no longer had any records about the visa refusal. They contend that all that could have been learned were the son's personal reasons for seeking an Indian visa, which bears no relevance to his admissibility to Canada and therefore is not a material fact. With respect, the destruction of documents that the officer wished to consult cannot be used as a factor to support the applicants' submissions when an 18 month interval intercedes between when the misrepresentation was made and when it came to the officer's attention. Rather, these circumstances describe the harm that arises from failing to provide accurate answers on the application by delaying the officer's investigation and supports the conclusion that the misrepresentation was material."], ["[40]", "I also reject the applicants' further submissions that, because the officer was able to make the necessary inquiries after the passport check, the misrepresentation did not prevent the officer from \"undertaking the correct procedures that would have normally been taken.\" This argument is without merit. Correct procedures entailed learning from the Indian authorities why the son was refused a visa in the circumstances where such refusals were known to be rare."], ["[41]", "I also agree with the respondent that the officer's reasons were not focused on why the visa refusal occurred, but rather the fact that CIC did not have an opportunity to examine a material fact (the son's immigration history) and that this could have led to an error in the admissibility determination.

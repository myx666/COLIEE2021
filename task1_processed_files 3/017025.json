The test must reasonably subject his story to an examination of its consistency with the probabilities that surround the currently existing conditions. In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions. [...] Again a witness may testify what he sincerely believes to be true, but he may be quite honestly mistaken. For a trial Judge to say \"I believe him because I judge him to be telling the truth\", is to come to a conclusion on consideration of only half the problem. In truth it may easily be self-direction of a dangerous kind."], ["[21] The Board identified no basis for concluding that the visiting card was fraudulent, other than its inconsistency with the conclusion already reached on credibility."], ["[35]", "The Board in the case at hand similarly erred by concluding, based on analysis independent of the summons, that the Applicant's claim was not credible and on that basis reaching its conclusion as to the genuineness of the summons.

In that case, in stating that corroboration does not make an incredible story credible, Justice Harrington was considering an argument that the panel, in rejecting a claim for refugee protection, failed to consider a letter from the claimant's father which gave evidence that corroborated some aspect of the claimant's story. However, that is distinguishable from the case at hand, where the evidence that the Board failed to properly assess was not that of another witness but what purports to be objective and state-issued documentary evidence of the events that the Board was otherwise concluding did not occur."], ["[37]", "The Respondent argues that the Board's decision must be considered as a whole, rather than considering each of its credibility findings in isolation. While I agree with this as a general principle, my conclusion is that the error in the treatment of the summons is sufficiently fundamental that on its own it warrants the Board's decision being set aside and returned for redetermination by a differently constituted panel. It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider the Applicant's arguments with respect to other components of the Board's credibility determinations and, as the credibility of the Applicant's claims will be considered afresh by a new panel, I make no specific findings thereon."], ["[38]", "Counsel for both parties confirmed that neither party proposes any question of general importance for certification for appeal.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[39]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "this application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is referred to the Board for re-determination by a different panel member.

First, at least 20 of the applicants were entitled to proceed on their understanding of their legal rights. Having put forward their position, and the Chief Electoral Officer having responded to that position, it is the right of the applicants to seek adjudication upon the propriety of the response. The evidence does not establish that the issues raised in this proceeding are frivolous or vexatious, or that the proceeding is so bereft of any possibility of success, that it can be said to have been motivated for an improper purpose.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "Second, any concern that the Court is being asked to alter the custom of the Lubicon Nation is subsumed in the argument with respect to the scope of available relief.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(ii) Did the Chief Electoral Officer improperly disqualify qualified voters?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "In oral argument both the applicants and the Chief and Council proceeded on the basis that the decision of the Chief Electoral Officer with respect to voter eligibility should be reviewed on the standard of patent unreasonableness.

To vote, one must be a recognized member of the Lubicon Lake People. As the Chief Electoral Officer observed, however, meeting the criteria for membership set out in the Membership Code is by itself not enough to qualify one as an elector. Once the initial membership list was established, persons eligible for enrolment must be added to the list following the criteria set out in the Membership Code. Deletions from the membership list are similarly to be made pursuant to the criteria set out in the Membership Code. Importantly, persons whose claim to membership is in dispute are entitled to be heard at a hearing before the Chief and Council and, potentially, at a further hearing before the qualified electors of the Lubicon Lake Indian Nation.

Any custom with respect to the absence or irrelevance of a membership list was not properly established by the evidence. Further, the content of the memorandum of the Chief and Council quoted above appears to contradict the existence of any such custom, because custom requires that the practices be generally acceptable to members of the band and be practices upon which there is a broad consensus.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), where Mr. Justice Martineau recently canvassed the general principles applicable to band custom at paragraph 20 and following.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "With respect to the ruling made by the Chief Electoral Officer, she swore in her affidavit filed in this proceeding that \"I had to satisfy myself that [the applicants] qualified as electors in the Lubicon Election\". It appears from the Chief Electoral Officer's Final Report that the Lubicon membership clerk was present at the election. When an individual asked the Chief Electoral Officer if she (the individual) was qualified to vote, the Chief Electoral Officer checked with the membership clerk and was informed that the inquiring person had applied for membership in the Lubicon Nation and had been accepted. The Chief Electoral Officer then advised the individual that \"You're (sic) been accepted as a member. You can vote\". However, no similar inquiry was directed with respect to the applicants, and when one applicant asked to see the membership list, the request was denied.

The Chief Electoral Officer read documents filed in the 1996 proceeding and so knew or ought to have known that no such band existed. At the election she was advised by counsel for the applicants that no band had been formed. Faced with this, the Chief Electoral Officer concluded the non-existence of such a band to be irrelevant.

The word \"band\" is defined in the", "Indian Act", "and the reference to the", "Indian Act", "in article 4(b) of the Membership Code means, in my view, that the intent was that to lose one's membership in the Lubicon Nation one must choose to join an entity that is a band as defined in the", "Indian Act", ".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[36]", "Band is defined in subsection 2(1) of the", "Indian Act", "to mean:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"a body of Indians  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(a) for whose use and benefit in common, lands, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, have been set apart before, on or after the 4th day of September, 1951,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(b) for whose use and benefit in common, moneys are held by Her Majesty, or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(c) declared by the Governor in Council to be a band for the purposes of this Act. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[37]", "Thus, even if the Chief Electoral Officer was entitled to disqualify potential electors who were on the membership list of the Lubicon Lake People, before doing so the Chief Electoral Officer was obliged to determine that the elector was a member of an entity that fell within the statutory definition of a \"band\".

While I acknowledge that a band is not the same thing as a First Nation (see:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at paragraph 25), this submission is not grounded in the evidence of this case. Without doubt, the Chief Electoral Officer did not direct herself to consider whether persons should be disqualified on the basis that they had joined another Indian Nation. Rather, the Chief Electoral Officer was concerned as to whether they had formed a new band. This is amply established in paragraphs 6 and 8 of the affidavit of the Chief Electoral Officer, as well as in the excerpts of the Chief Electoral Officer's Final Report set out above and underlined.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[39]", "As for the second problematic aspect of the approach of the Chief Electoral Officer, for a person associated with the 1996 proceeding to be found to be qualified to vote, the Chief Electoral Officer required that he or she sign an affidavit by which they both re-affirmed that they wanted to be a member of the Lubicon Nation and disassociated themselves from the legal proceeding. The Chief Electoral Officer in her report characterized this second requirement in the following terms \"This affidavit says you do not want to be part of this legal action\". The importance of this requirement to the Chief Electoral Officer was such that she said she was inclined to forward such affidavits to the Federal Court of Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[40]", "Even if the Chief Electoral Officer was entitled to proceed without specific regard to the membership list, the requirement that persons renounce the 1996 proceeding in an affidavit was a requirement not rationally connected to the Membership Code. To be eligible for inclusion on the membership list one must meet the criteria contained in the Membership Code. Those criteria relate to known aboriginal ancestry, family and historic ties and any decision as to membership ultimately is to be made by the Chief and Council or the eligible electors.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[41]", "The Chief Electoral Officer erred in requiring persons to withdraw from participation in a legal proceeding as consideration for being allowed to exercise their right to vote, because that action by itself could not restore membership to anyone who had been properly stripped of membership.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[42]", "Accordingly, for these reasons, by failing to have regard to the membership list of the Lubicon Lake Indian Nation, by disqualifying persons from voting on the basis that they had joined another legal band which did not exist, and by applying an irrelevant criteria to the issue of voter eligibility, the Chief Electoral Officer committed reviewable errors which require the intervention of this Court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(iii) Did the Chief Electoral Officer improperly allow non-qualified persons to vote?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[43]", "The applicants say that when they were asked by the Chief Electoral Officer to leave the room so that the election could be conducted, individuals remained in the room who they believe were ineligible to vote. They say, in the words of both Violet Ominayak and Loreen Ominayak, that they believe those persons \"may have been allowed to vote\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[44]", "This evidence does not establish that the then remaining individuals voted, or that they were actually ineligible to vote. In the absence of evidence establishing that unqualified individuals actually voted, there is no basis for challenging any action of the Chief Electoral Officer in this regard.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(iv) Was the Chief Electoral Officer biased in her application of the rules re: voter eligibility?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[45]", "The applicants argue that the election was a sham and say that the following matters demonstrate bias or a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Chief Electoral Officer:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "i) She is a personal friend of the Chief, two councillors, the membership clerk and the Band's consultant;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "ii) Her interpretation of the Membership Code is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that the Chief Electoral Officer is legally trained;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "iii) She determined before the election was held that she would disqualify those who had expressed the desire to set up a new band;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "iv) She ignored requests to see the membership list, and did not herself request to see it;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "v) She demonstrated unquestioned deference to the Chief at one point when the Chief advised that a person had not submitted a formal request for membership; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "vi) She abdicated her duty to determine voter eligibility by relying upon persons present at the election to draw to her attention any unqualified voters.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[46]", "Dealing with each of those items, the evidence failed to establish any close personal friendship between the Chief Electoral Officer and any of the Chief, councillors, membership clerk or band consultant. The Chief Electoral Officer had known the band consultant for 20 or 25 years and knew others as \"people I would sit down and have coffee with\". Disqualification for bias does not normally result from prior business or professional relationships, and the evidence does not support any conclusion as to a close personal relationship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[47]", "As for the Chief Electoral Officer's interpretation of the Membership Code, her position with respect to the membership list, and her reliance upon challenges from people present, such actions are equally consistent with a bona fide interpretation of the Lubicon election custom.

The evidence fails to satisfy me that the Chief Electoral Officer was not open to persuasion at the election. No submissions were addressed to her as to the propriety of the scope of the affidavits she required (that is, no one complained that the affidavit went too far in requiring disassociation from the 1996 proceedings as opposed to simply re-affirming membership). The balance of her decision was in substance a legal interpretation of the proper application of the Membership Code. Holding firm to that interpretation does not necessarily establish pre-judgment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[49]", "Finally, the one instance relied upon falls short of establishing unquestioned deference to the Chief. The Chief Electoral Officer accepted on one occasion the Chief's advice as to a matter of fact within his knowledge. No one contradicted that advice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[50]", "Having reviewed briefly the evidence relied upon by the applicants in support of their assertion of bias, I turn to the legal principle to be applied. The test for bias requires that the Court ask what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, and having thought the matter through, conclude? Applying that test, I am not satisfied that a reasonable and informed person, viewing the matters asserted by the applicants realistically and practically, and thinking the matter through, would conclude that the Chief Electoral Officer was biased or that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(v) The appropriate relief to be granted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[51]", "As Mr. Justice Muldoon observed in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at paragraph 79, the jurisprudence of this Court demonstrates that the Court may fashion a remedy appropriate to the circumstances. This reflects the fact that remedies available on judicial review are discretionary.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[52]", "An application for judicial review is a public law proceeding. Therefore, the relief granted by the Court should further the public interest.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at paragraph 220 and following.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[53]", "In the exercise of that discretion, I consider the most important fact to be that the impugned election took place four years ago. The applicants commenced this proceeding in May of 1999. In January of 2000 a Notice of Status Review was issued by the Court requiring the applicants to show cause why the application should not be dismissed for delay because 180 days had elapsed since issuance of the notice of application and no requisition for hearing had been filed. While the matter was subsequently allowed to proceed, a requisition for hearing was not filed until January of 2002, two years after the notice of status review and two and three quarter years after the election. No request was made that the proceeding or the hearing date be expedited.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[54]", "Further, given that by custom, elections take place every five years, the next election will likely take place within the next year. (The election previous to the one at issue took place on May 24, 1994).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[55]", "As well, while there is no evidence directly on this point it is a reasonable inference that in the intervening four years since the election the Chief and councillors have made a number of decisions, the validity of which might be questioned if the election was set aside. Third parties, including the Chief and Council and members of the Lubicon People, may well have acted upon the decision of the chief electoral officer to their detriment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[56]", "In view of the lengthy period of time that has elapsed since the election, the imminence of the next election, and the disruption that would ensue from quashing the result of the election four years after the fact, I am not prepared to quash the result of the 1999 election. It follows that no relief is necessary or appropriate with respect to the process to be followed in any new election necessitated by the quashing of the 1999 election. In any event I am satisfied that relief such as declaring voter eligibility in a future election, requiring the preparation of a voter's list and ordering that the election be by secret ballot, should not be granted for the following reasons. With respect to future voter eligibility, it may be that factors such as residence and membership have changed or may change, making any such declaration inaccurate now or at the time of a future election. The further relief sought with respect to a voter's list and a secret ballot would be contrary to the evidence before the Court in this proceeding as to the applicable band custom.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[57]", "I am not prepared to declare as requested that the applicants were members of the Lubicon Lake Indian Nation on April 25, 1999. This is an issue to be determined pursuant to the custom of the Lubicon People. It is sufficient for the purpose of this proceeding to state that the Chief Electoral Officer erred in finding persons not to be qualified to vote on the basis stated by the Chief Electoral Officer. In any event, that there is no evidence as to whether all of the applicants otherwise met the membership criteria on April 25, 1999, i.e. for example, did they all live on traditional Lubicon lands.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[58]", "The sole order to be issued will be an order quashing the decision of the Chief Electoral Officer declaring individuals to be ineligible to vote in the Lubicon election because they were parties to the 1996 proceedings and refused to sign an affidavit dissociating themselves from that legal action.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "COSTS  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[59]", "At the hearing counsel requested the opportunity to make written submissions as to costs after the release of these reasons. Accordingly, counsel for the applicants may serve and file written submissions as to costs within 14 days of receipt of these reasons.

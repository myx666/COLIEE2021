In September 2007, the applicant attended an interview at the Canadian Embassy in Ankara, to discuss his application.

The applicant explained that though he supports some of the PKK's goals, he does not support the PKK because he did not believe in violence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "On September 3, 2009, the application was refused on the grounds that the applicant was inadmissible for being a member of the PKK (the first refusal). The applicant sought judicial review of that decision on the ground that the reasons for suspecting his membership in the PKK had not been disclosed to him.

The respondent did not answer any of the applicant's counsel's three letters. The computer assisted immigration processing system (CAIPS) notes in the certified tribunal record contain entries indicating that the applicant was called a day prior to the interview and advised that he did not need to bring any documents to support the bona fides of his marriage and that the interview was to review his admissibility to Canada, not his eligibility as a member of the family class. That portion of the CAIPS notes is also attached as an exhibit to the affidavit of an assistant in the respondent's counsel's office.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "At the interview, the applicant was again questioned about his involvement with the PKK. The applicant admitted to attending a PKK meeting in Switzerland, to donating money to the party, selling their magazines and event tickets, and to attending events put on by the PKK. He repeated his abhorrence of violence and stated that he was not a member of the PKK, but told the officer that there is social pressure in the Kurdish community to take part in PKK activities and to donate money to the party. He stated that any involvement with PKK activities on his part was a result of coercion and social pressure.

Specifically, the officer found reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant was a member of the PKK.

The officer found that the applicant had changed his story about his involvement with the PKK when he was confronted with the possible conclusion of inadmissibility as a result of that involvement. The applicant had also failed to disclose his period of residence in Switzerland and had not been truthful about terms of incarceration. In the result, the officer questioned his credibility.

The officer's analysis mirrors that part of the CBSA memorandum which reflects adversely on the applicant.

Here, membership was not conceded and it was open to the officer on a balancing of all of the evidence to reach a different conclusion.

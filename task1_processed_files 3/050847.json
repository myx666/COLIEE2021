First, the general understanding that parties to the original proceedings are automatically to be named as respondents when these proceedings are subject to judicial review was developed in the context of adversarial proceedings, in which the competing rights of two or more parties are adjudicated, and not necessarily where the proceedings, as here, are in the nature of an inquiry."], ["[19]", "Indeed, prior to the major overhaul of the", "Federal Court Rules", "in 1998, Rule 1602(3) did provide that \"Any interested person who is adverse in interest to the applicant in the proceedings before the federal board, commission or other tribunal shall be named as a respondent\" in a judicial review application. The Federal Court, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that this rule did not apply to persons who were granted standing before a commission of inquiry. It reasoned that because the nature of such a commission was inquisitorial rather than adversarial, persons who had been granted standing before a commission were not entitled to be named as respondents but could seek leave to intervene pursuant to the Court's discretionary powers under Rule 1611 - akin to the current Rule 109 of the", "Federal Courts Rules", ". Although the relevant provisions of the", "Federal Courts Rules", "have changed, and that decision is therefore not directly applicable here, the Court's analysis of the distinction between adversarial and inquisitorial processes remains relevant. A person who was granted standing, even as a full participant, before an inquisitorial body should not, in my view, automatically be considered a necessary respondent to an application for judicial review arising out of these proceedings; that person would still be required to show that it is \"directly affected by the order sought in the application\", as provided by Rule 303(1)."], ["[20]", "The second and perhaps most obvious reason why Mr. Chapman's argument cannot be retained is that he was not, in fact, granted standing as a party in the proceedings before the Inquiry Committee."], ["[21]", "The record shows that Mr. Chapman did seek \"full standing to participate in the entirety of the Hearing, with the rights of a party, including the rights to full disclosure, as well as to cross-examine and call evidence and make legal submissions\" [see footnote 1] based on his alleged rights and interests as complainant. The Inquiry Committee considered and expressly rejected this request as follows [see footnote 2]:", "\"[15] We have concluded that the mere status of being the complainant whose complaint has initiated an investigation under s. 63(2) of the", "Judges Act", "does not grant any right to standing before an inquiry committee constituted in the course of that investigation.

Moreover, a party may exercise all the rights of a party in the proceedings, including the right to appeal the decision that is made when the matter is heard, while an intervenor essentially has the right to participate within the limits the Court may impose and has no right to appeal except by leave of the Court.\""], ["[30]", "As mentioned, the Inquiry Committee specifically found that Mr. Chapman had no legal rights that will be affected by the proceedings before it, but that he did, in the particular circumstances of the case, have an interest justifying limited participation."], ["[31]", "That interest laid in ensuring that he be afforded procedural and substantive fairness where evidence going to the credibility of the factual allegations he made in respect of private events was adduced and considered."], ["[32]", "This Court, in hearing and determining the present application, will not be called upon to hear, weigh or express any opinion as to the credibility of or conclusions to be drawn from that evidence.

Because judicial review involves the exercise of the Court's supervisory jurisdiction over public bodies, Rule 304 requires that the Attorney General be served with any application for judicial review.

To be clear, the Attorney General does not take the position that he is unwilling to act, but that, in view of the nature of the proceedings giving rise to this application, he is unable, at law, to act as respondent."], ["[57]", "The rationale supporting the Attorney General's position is presented in detail in his motion record, and will be analyzed below. However, as a preliminary issue raised at the hearing before me, the Attorney General argued that it is not the Court's task, on this motion, to determine whether the Attorney General is indeed unable to act as respondent herein. The Attorney General submits that Rule 303(3) only requires him to provide a reasonable basis for his conclusion that he is unable to act. Upon this, the Court should show significant deference to the Attorney General's determination, and proceed directly to consider whether another person should be substituted to the Attorney General."], ["[58]", "There is no support in the wording of Rule 303(3) or at law for this interpretation.

Deference to the Attorney General, it seems to me, might come into consideration where the grounds for the motion is unwillingness to act, but I need not determine this point on this motion."], ["[59]", "To summarize, then, the application of Rule 303, in the context of this judicial review application, proceeds from the following analytical sequence: As there are no persons directly affected by the order sought and required to be named as respondents pursuant to Rule 303(1), the Attorney General was properly named pursuant to Rule 303(2). Rule 303(2) requires that the Attorney General be named as a respondent by default to enable him to exercise his function as guardian of the rule of law. In exercising this function, the Attorney General is not required to defend the application. He may support it, or limit his participation to make submissions to assist the Court in reaching a decision that accords with the law.

The scope of the Minister's constitutional role in referring the matter of a judge's removal to Parliament would, in that perspective, be confined to evaluating the CJC's report and recommendation for the purpose of deciding whether to put the matter before Parliament.

As a practical matter, however, and especially with the lessons learned from the Landreville experience, it seems to me improbable that Parliament could be moved to recommend the removal of a judge without the kind of firm foundation in fact and principle that is likely to be obtained through an inquiry under Part II of the", "Judges Act", "or its functional equivalent."], ["[85]", "The above passage acknowledges that it would be improbable that the Minister would put such a matter before Parliament without \"the kind of firm foundation in fact and principle that is likely to be obtained through an inquiry under Part II of the", "Judges Act", "\", but also remarks that the Minister could see fit to rely on the \"functional equivalent\" of an inquiry under the", "Judges Act", ", such as, for example, an inquiry under the", "Inquiries Act", ", RS 1985 c I-11."], ["[86]", "Parliament, in establishing the inquiry process under the", "Judges Act", ", has not created a special body or process placed beyond judicial review. Where, in judicial review proceedings, a question arises as to whether the Inquiry Committee has properly discharged the functions entrusted to it by Parliament, the rule of law is at issue and the public interest is engaged. The Attorney General's role as protector of the rule of law is to ensure that public bodies such as the Inquiry Committee carry out their duties in accordance with the law, and that when they do so, their decisions are respected.

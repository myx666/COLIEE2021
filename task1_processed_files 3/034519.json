Following this decision, an immigration officer undertook to review the applicant's circumstances to determine whether the applicant was a member of the PDRCC. By decision dated April 5, 1994, it was determined that the applicant was not a member of the PDRCC. Subsequently, pursuant to s. 2(1)(c) of the", "Immigration Regulations", "and to the Special Announcement by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration dated May 20, 1994, a further risk assessment of the applicant's case was initiated. The post-claim determination officer (PCDO), in a decision dated January 6, 1995, determined that the applicant would not likely be subjected to a personal, objectively identifiable risk to his life, of extreme sanctions or of inhumane treatment in his country of citizenship and therefore, was not entitled to remain in Canada. Accordingly, a deportation order became effective against the applicant upon his notification of the officer's decision. The applicant was requested to provide proof of arrangements that he would leave Canada by March 24, 1995. The applicant commenced the instant application for judicial review and applied for a stay of the deportation order. However, the stay was denied on March 22, 1995.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Reasons For Decision In Question  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "On January 6, 1995, the PCDO, H. O'Neil, determined that the claimant was not likely to be subjected to a personal, objectively identifiable risk to his life, to extreme sanctions, or to inhumane treatment in his country of citizenship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "The officer considered the following facts from the applicant's Personal Information Form: the applicant was elected interpreter between the villagers in the Security Zone (controlled by the Israeli backed Southern Lebanese Army) and the local United Nations base. While visiting his father-in-law's home in South Beirut, the applicant was blindfolded and driven to a place for interrogation by Hezbollah about his involvement in the civil administration as an interpreter. Hezbollah accused the applicant of spying on them, threatened him with death, and told him to never again leave the Security Zone. A few weeks later, the Southern Lebanese Army found out about the applicant's capture in Beirut and told him that \"if my captors in Beirut had released me, it would only be because I had agreed to cooperate with them\". The applicant was ordered to leave the Security Zone as soon as possible.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "The officer further considered the following elements of the negative CRDD decision: the claimant was permitted to re-enter the Security Zone by the Southern Lebanese Army after showing his American visa and indicating that he was going to leave the country as soon as he sold his car. The panel stated that if the Hezbollah believed the claimant to be a supporter of the Southern Lebanese Army, it would seem reasonable that they would not release him. Because they did release him, the panel concluded that there is not a reasonable chance that the military wing of the Islamic Resistance, the Hezb'alla, would take action against the claimant because he is a member of the CAC, that would amount to persecution if he were returned to Lebanon. The panel concluded, despite the applicant's testimony, that he could seek refuge in the Beirut area without serious possibility of persecution. The panel observed, and the officer was also of the view, that the applicant should not fear the Syrians in view of his two voluntary visits to Damascus in late 1992, with no problems from Syrian authorities and his uneventful departure from Beirut's heavily guarded airport.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "The officer also considered the submissions of counsel which indicated that the applicant was targeted in the South by the Southern Lebanese Army and in Beirut by the Hezbollah. Further, the officer noted documentary evidence that was submitted, as well as counsel's conclusions that \"The influence of Hezbollah in Lebanon is such that were one targeted by this group, I do not believe there is anywhere in the country where one could live safely\" and that Hezbollah has links with the Lebanese Army and with Syria.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The officer concluded as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Subject may indeed run a risk to his life or inhumane treatment in the south of Lebanon and in areas controlled by Hezbollah like southern Beirut. However, the government forces are in control of the Greater Beirut area (except southern Beirut). The Syrians are the major influence in Lebanon and control the northern cities. Subject does not appear to have any problems with the Syrians, having been able to travel to Syria twice in late 1992 and being able to leave from the airport without any trouble. In my opinion, the internal flight alternative is an option. Subject could live in northern parts of Lebanon and in most areas of Beirut.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Based on the documentation before me, and having applied the criteria of regulation 2(1)(c), I conclude that Fouad Assaad Gharib, upon return to Lebanon, would not likely be subjected to an objectively identifiable risk, which risk would apply in every part of Lebanon and would not be faced generally by other individuals in or from Lebanon. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "This finding was similar to that of the CRDD which, having preferred the documentary evidence to the applicant's evidence that he could not live outside the Security Zone because of the presence of the Islamic Resistance all over the country, concluded that the applicant had an internal flight alternative in the Beirut area.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Statutory Provisions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "Section 6(5) of the", "Immigration Act", "permits an exemption to the visa requirement in s. 9(1) by allowing an immigrant and all dependants to be granted landing for reasons of public policy or compassionate and humanitarian considerations.

The information so obtained contains statements that would tend to support the applicant's position (the statements that would tend to support the applicant's position are outlined in paras. 11 to 14 of the affidavit of Jane Hueston), thereby giving weight to the argument that the applicant could have countered the information contained in the impugned memorandum if it had been disclosed to the applicant prior to the PDRCC decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "In my opinion, the impugned memorandum constitutes extrinsic evidence not brought forward to the applicant.

The applicant submits that portions of the memorandum (those parts dealing with the strength of the Hezbollah in the south and their lower profile in less violent involvement in Beirut), could have led the PCDO to the conclusion that parts of Beirut and areas outside the south of Lebanon afford an internal flight alternative (IFA) to the applicant. This, the applicant submits, was prejudicial to him. The applicant argues that the information derived by the applicant following the disclosure of the December 6, 1994 memorandum was relevant to the issue of IFA, upon which the PCDO's decision ultimately rested, and therefore may have influenced the decision if it had been brought to the attention of the decision-maker as it should have been. I agree, it is not for me to speculate as to the impact which this information could have had on the ultimate decision if it had been made available before it was reached. The fact is that the memorandum in question referred to facts and opinions which were considered by the PCDO as relevant to the issue to be decided and which were relied upon.

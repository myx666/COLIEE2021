The claimant argues, however, that the political nature of the threats is evidenced by his PIF narrative and corroborated by evidence of two police reports. He notes that the Board member relied on these reports as evidence of the state's willingness to protect the claimant."], ["[36]", "I agree with the Respondent that it was open to the Board member to find that the Applicants had not established a nexus with a Convention ground. In this regard, the Board member considered but refused the claimant's submission that he was a well-known person with a political profile whose fears are related to his refusal to join a union and alleged ties with the AUC. She similarly found that the claimant had produced insufficient corroborating evidence regarding the flyers allegedly labelling him as a traitor. Even if he was targeted by the FARC, the Board member was at liberty to conclude that it was only for extortion purposes and this was insufficient to ground a claim on political opinion."], ["[37]", "Contrary to the Applicants' submissions, the Board member specifically addressed the police reports and found that they did not assist the Applicants in establishing a nexus because they failed to speak to the motive of the alleged threats:", "The claimant was asked, in relation to the first police report, why, if no other employees had refused to join the union in his place of employment, and he was alleging that he was being threatened as a result of his refusal to join the union, it was indicated that other job mates have also been threatened. The claimant stated that they were being threatened for other reasons, unrelated to the union.", "In relation to the second police report, the claimant was asked why the police report stated that the caller demanded payment of money and again made no mention of any alleged motive relating to his refusal to join the union, and the claimant testified that [the] real intention of the message was just to get him to call them back.", "Decision, para 15"], ["[38]", "The Board member's conclusion that the claimant had not established sufficient credible and probative evidence that he had been persecuted for his political opinions was thus within her discretion in light of his failure to explain inconsistencies in the evidence suggesting that certain colleagues had been threatened for reasons unrelated to the union and that one of the calls he received demanded payment of money without targeting the claimant's political motives. The Board member could have come to a different conclusion, but it was certainly not unreasonable to conclude as she did on the basis of the evidence that was before her."], ["[39]", "While the Board member carefully considered the existence of a nexus under section 96 of IRPA, she did not undertake a specific section 97 analysis, presumably due to her conclusion that the nature and degree of the alleged risk was immaterial in light of her findings regarding the availability of state protection and an IFA in Cali. It is difficult to understand, however, how the Board member could correctly consider the availability of state protection and an IFA when she had failed to characterize the nature and the degree of any risk that would be faced by the Applicants were they to return to Colombia. The availability of state protection and of a viable IFA will obviously vary depending on whether an individual faces a generalized or personalized risk."], ["[40]", "A victim of crime-related harm cannot be automatically excluded from the purview of section 97 of IRPA. After reviewing the abundant case law on the subject, Justice Gleason proposed at paragraph 40 of", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "that the essential starting point for a section 97 analysis is to appropriately determine the nature of the risk faced by a claimant. One must first determine whether the applicant faces an ongoing or future risk, the nature of the risk, and the basis of that risk, before comparing it to the risk faced by a significant group in the country in order to determine whether the risks are of the same nature and degree."], ["[41]", "This assessment is of particular relevance in the case at bar in light of the Board member's dismissal of the section 96 claim on the basis that the claimant is a victim of criminality. While the Board member does not find certain of the claimant's allegations to be credible, she accepts the content and the probative value of the two police reports and, indeed, relies upon them as evidence of the state's willingness to protect the Applicants. While the Board member twice finds that there is insufficient evidence to indicate that the claimant has a profile of (ongoing) interest to anyone in Colombia and, consequently, that there is less than a mere possibility that he would be considered a target by the FARC (Decision, at paras 42 and 51), it is not clear that these findings can be separated from the Board member's simplistic conclusion that the claimant is a \"victim of crime\"."], ["[42]", "For example, the Board member did not engage with the claimant's testimony at pages 505-506 of the Tribunal Record that the FARC continued to threaten him once he had resigned from his job in order to \"show their power\", \"get more people on their side\" and \"terrify people\" by showing \"that they could destroy anyone's life at any time for anyone that does not agree with them or does not want to...does not agree with the union or anyone that could influence\". If the claimant is in fact subject to a personal risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, the Board member could not dismiss that risk on the basis that it is a general crime-related risk. It may be that the findings of the Board member with respect to the claimant's profile (or lack thereof) could be interpreted as establishing that he has failed to prove the existence of a personalized risk; however, in the absence of any section 97 analysis separate and apart from the state protection and IFA findings, such a conclusion would be purely speculative."], ["[43]", "As a result, and despite the fact that this argument was not thoroughly developed by the Applicants, I feel obliged to conclude, on the correctness standard, that the Board member erred in failing to turn her mind to this aspect of section 97 of IRPA. Due to the potential impact this error could have on the state protection and IFA analyses, it would be sufficient, in and of itself, to overturn the decision and to send it back for re-determination.", "ii) Were the Board member's findings on state protection reasonable and determinative?"], ["[44]", "The Board member was correct in stating that the onus is on the applicant to approach the state for protection in situations where state protection might be reasonably forthcoming. It is absolutely true that an applicant, to qualify for refugee status, must satisfy the Board that he or she sought, but was unable to obtain, protection from his or her home state, or alternatively, that the home state, on an objective basis, could not be expected to provide protection."], ["[45]", "In the case at bar, the Board member acknowledged that there were problems in Columbia, including with the FARC and other guerrilla groups, but found upon review that the government had made great strides in countering these organizations. She found that Columbia was at a point where its national security was no longer threatened by such groups; there had been thousands of paramilitaries demobilized, the state was assuming greater control of previously occupied regions, and there was a significant reduction in the activities of these groups."], ["[46]", "Counsel for the Applicants submitted that the Board member erred in her assessment of the situation in Columbia, and referred to extracts of the documentary evidence stating that Columbia's judiciary is dysfunctional and that the government had to deploy its army and seek the assistance of other nations to combat the insurgents, thereby acknowledging that local policing is not adequate to defend or protect an individual victim from harm by such a group. I agree with the Respondent that these submissions amount to no more than a disagreement with the weighing of the evidence. The Board member's reasons ought not be subject to microscopic deconstruction, and it is not the role of this Court on judicial review to reweigh the evidence before the Board."], ["[47]", "That being said, I am nevertheless of the view that the Board member erred in assessing the claimant's personal situation. First of all, the Board member could not reasonably conclude that the Applicants denied the state an opportunity to act by leaving the country shortly after receiving additional threats in December 2010. The claimant had been receiving threats since February 2010 and had sought the assistance of the police on a number of occasions during that year. Contrary to what the Board member seems to be implying at paragraph 31 of her Decision, this is not a situation where the claimant is trying to rebut the presumption of state protection merely by asserting a subjective reluctance to engage the state. While there may be some inconsistencies in the claimant's statements as to how many times he visited the police, he clearly made at least three reports for the incidents that occurred between February and November 2010. It may be that these attempts would not have been sufficient to show that the Applicants have exhausted all of the recourses available to them domestically in a country like the United States (see", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED). In a country where state protection is far from perfect, however, as was accepted by the Board member to be the case in Columbia, and where the government must rely on the army to protect citizens, it cannot reasonably be stated that this claimant doubted the effectiveness of protection offered by the state without really testing it."], ["[48]", "Moreover, the Board member suggests that the willingness of the police to take the claimant's reports (whether there were 3 or 12 of them, as asserted by the claimant) and initiate investigations is, without more, evidence of adequate state protection (Decision, para 39). In", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, Justice Mactavish found that it was unreasonable to equate \"the adequacy of state protection with police interest in making serious efforts to protect citizens.\" Counsel for the Respondent argued that there was not much for the police to go on, as the claimant was unable to identify the persecutors or to provide any meaningful information enabling the police to further their investigation. He did, however, provide the phone numbers that the threats originated from as well as the envelope announcing his funeral. After 10 months, there was no indication that the police had done anything more than accept the claimant's reports. In such circumstances, and without more, I do not think that it was reasonable to conclude that the claimant had not rebutted the presumption that state protection was available and his credibility was not questioned in this regard.", "iii) Did the Board member err in her analysis of the existence of a viable IFA in Cali?"], ["[49]", "The Applicants take issue with the following statement in the Board member's reasons, claiming it is sufficient to establish that she applied the wrong test in her assessment of the existence of an IFA:", "It is not a matter of the claimant's convenience or the attractiveness of the IFA, but whether one should be expected to make do in that location before traveling half-way around the world to seek a safe haven, in another country.", "Decision, para 44"], ["[50]", "I agree with the Respondent that, when read in context, the Board member did not suggest that the Applicants were obliged to demonstrate they had travelled to Cali and were actually persecuted there. It is clear from a careful reading of paragraph 44 in its entirety and of paragraph 45 that the Board member made no error in her articulation of the law relating to internal flight alternatives and was well apprised of the case law and of the general principles on the subject. Indeed, counsel for the Applicants conceded at the hearing that this was not his strongest argument."], ["[51]", "Were this the sole issue with the Board member's finding, I would therefore conclude that the decision regarding the availability of a viable IFA was not unreasonable. However, in light of my comments above regarding the shortcomings in the Board member's analysis of the availability of state protection, the finding on IFA cannot stand as it is far from clear that the Board member would have come to the same conclusion independently of her state protection findings. In fact, the interrelationship between the two findings is demonstrated by the following statements in the Board member's reasons:", "The claimant was asked if he could reside in Cali so as to avoid the FARC, and he testified that he could not because they operate everywhere throughout the country. The claimant was asked why he feared they would pursue him should he return to Cali, and he stated that they would want to show their power and make an example of him. The claimant was asked if he would be safe in Cali and be able to seek protection there, if needed, and he stated that he would not because the authorities do not have the time or the resources to do anything. The claimant was asked if there were any other reasons why he would be unable to live in Cali, other than his fear of the FARC, and he said there were not. I reject the claimant's assertions and find, as previously set out in this decision, that state protection would be available to this claimant should he need and seek it.", "Decision, para 47"], ["[52]", "In light of the above, it is clear that, having found the Board member's state protection findings to be unreasonable, I must similarly find her IFA findings unreasonable as the two conclusions can hardly be dissociated in the circumstances of this case."], ["[53]", "For all of the aforementioned reasons, this application for judicial review is therefore granted.

The dependent of an applicant would include his or her spouse and any dependent son or daughter, which would include a son or daughter who is less than 19 years of age and unmarried, or who is over that age and dependent by reason of being in school or suffering from a physical or mental disability.", "\"10. Regulation 9(2) says that no assessment need be made of the eligibility of a spouse of the applicant who is separated from and no longer cohabiting with the applicant, or a son or daughter of the applicant whose custody or guardianship is legally vested in the separated spouse or a former spouse of the applicant. A separated spouse or a non-dependent son or daughter whose eligibility is not assessed because of Regulation 9(2) can not be granted a visa as an accompanying dependent of the application.", "\"11. Thus, if Mr. Adesina were making his application for landing from outside Canada, and if he is in fact divorced and his ex-wife has legal custody of their children, the existence of his ex-wife and the children in her legal custody would not affect his application, and his ex-wife and children could not be granted a visa.", "\"12.

A permanent resident has the right to sponsor the application of any person for permanent residence if the applicant is a member of the family class with respect to that permanent resident. Such an application normally would be made from outside Canada.

Pursuant to Regulation 6(5), no assessment is required of the eligibility of the spouse of the applicant if they are separated and no longer co-habiting. The eligibility of any children of which the spouse has legal custody and guardianship is similarly not required. Regulation 6(5) is substantially the same as Regulation 9(2), referred to above.", "\"13.

Based on this standard, the Court should not intervene unless the decision falls outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes or does not accord with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47)."], ["[10]", "By contrast, questions of procedural fairness and jurisdiction, as raised by the Applicants under Issue B, demand the correctness standard (see", "Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 434 at para 42-43).", "V.", "Analysis", "A.", "Did the Officer Err in her Assessment of the Evidence?"], ["[11]", "The Applicants dispute the Officer's factual findings as being made without regard for the evidence or in a perverse and capricious manner. They insist that their affidavits contradict those findings."], ["[12]", "Based on the Respondent's submissions, however, I am not convinced that the Officer's assessment of the evidence would be considered unreasonable."], ["[13]", "For example, Stephanie's affidavit contests the Officer's conclusion that there are \"regular and continuous telephone calls\" to her biological mother or regular contact more generally. However, she confirms that calls are made on Christmas, New Year's and birthdays. This is not at odds with the Officer's summation that there is regular contact on \"special occasions and holidays.\""], ["[14]", "Stephanie's affidavit acknowledges that she was refused visitor's visas on 2 occasions, but insists that she was never asked whether the \"entire family was refused visitor visas numerous times\" as implied by the Officer. I note that the Officer merely stated \"it appears\" as though the information was found in the file rather than attributing this assertion to any specific statement from Stephanie."], ["[15]", "Derek's affidavit claims that he \"did not state that [he had] not set aside funds for her education\" and was only asked about the RESP. The Officer's statement in this regard is nonetheless consistent with his response to the question \"Have you started an RESP for Stephanie's future education - college, university?\" Notes taken during the interview indicate that Derek stated: \"No. Cannot open account for her - does not have SIN. I have not set aside funds for university.\""], ["[16]", "Similarly, Derek takes issue with the Officer referring to the question of \"whether having an additional family member living with you posed a financial strain\" in his affidavit. The Officer asked him more specifically in the interview whether \"[a]dopting Stephanie would have incurred added expense. How has this affected you financially?\" Although the wording is slightly different, it elicits a similar response. The Officer made reference to Stephanie not having a Health Card as well as Derek paying her bills and a $500 allowance. This evidence is reflected in the Officer's decision and the Applicants' affidavits."], ["[17]", "Derek's affidavit also elaborates on his reasons for adopting Stephanie. He refers to the financial support he could provide, giving the difficulties facing his sister in caring for her on her own. Derek expresses his desire to have a child of his own and give Stephanie a better life and education in Canada. The Officer's assessment that the reasons were to help out her birth mother and give Stephanie a better quality of life and education in Canada reflects these statements and do not amount to misconstruing the evidence."], ["[18]", "The Applicants have also expressed disbelief in the Officer's conclusion that their relationship began after the adoption took place in 2008. They note that Stephanie started living with Derek in March 2008 but the adoption order was not rendered until December 10, 2008. Prior to living with Derek, however, the Applicants had only met on one occasion in 2005. Irrespective of the exact date of the adoption order, they began living together and only developed any sort of relationship starting in 2008 for the purposes of the adoption contemplated by Derek as early as the first meeting in 2005. The Officer's conclusion was justified."], ["[19]", "Although Justice Richard Mosley faulted a citizenship officer for attributing no weight to certain key contradictory pieces of evidence relating to an adoption in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 29, he acknowledged that \"deference may still have been owed to the officer and the decision found to fall within the range of acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and law had it been clear that the officer properly considered the totality of the evidence.\""], ["[20]", "The Officer considered the totality of the evidence in this case and is entitled to considerable deference in the assessment of facts. There was no key piece of contradictory evidence ignored by the Officer amounting to an error as in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above."], ["[21]", "The Applicants' affidavits confirm much of the information presented in the Officer's decision and the concerns raised amount to a disagreement with the exact wording used and weighing of the evidence.

The Program Coordinator provided editing suggestions related to style and formatting or adding certain details. Despite some minor adjustments to the wording, the drafts and subsequent refusal letter clarify that the Officer reached her own conclusion and wrote the reasons independently. The suggestions provided did not relate to or affect the final outcome.", "VI.", "Conclusion"], ["[24]", "The Officer was reasonable in her assessment of the evidence and concern that the adoption had been entered into for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege in relation to immigration or citizenship contrary to subsection 5.1(1)(d).

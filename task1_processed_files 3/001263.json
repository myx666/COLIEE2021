The panel also notes that he did not seek a further extension of his visa, nor did he apply for Convention refugee status there. It appears, from the evidence, that throughout his stay in the U.S. he resided and worked illegally.

In this regard, the Board drew an adverse inference from the fact that the male applicant remained in the U.S. for close to three years without seeking the protection of that country, particularly since for all but two months, the applicant lived and worked illegally in the U.S. and was therefore in danger of being caught and returned to Sudan by U.S. authorities.

Given that the Board did not accept the male applicant's refugee claim, the Board could not accept that the female applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution in Sudan as her claim was based on her husband's claim. Similarly, the Board found that the minor applicants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Sudan.

I do not believe the Board committed any error in not examining this documentation since it found it implausible that the applicant was in fact involved in political activities after his release from detention.

A more analogous case is", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), a case in which the applicant returned from the U.K. to Turkey twice for short periods of time before making a claim in Canada. Rothstein, J., upheld the Board's finding that the applicant's returns to Turkey reflected negatively on the veracity of his alleged fears. Leaving aside the technical definition of \"re-availment of state protection\", it would seem that concluding that the applicants would not have returned to Sudan if they had had a well-founded fear of persecution is an inference that was reasonably open to the Board.

Considering the Board's finding that it was implausible that the male applicant would continue high profile activities against the government of Sudan while living illegally in the U.S. and while his wife was still in Sudan, the Board was entitled to give no weight to that letter.

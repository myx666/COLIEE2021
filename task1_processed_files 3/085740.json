All three applicants are citizens of Colombia. In September 2001 the principal applicant returned to Colombia after having lived in the United States for over one year on a visitor's visa. Upon her return she lived in her parent's home together with her sisters, nephew and two children. She says she immediately began to receive telephone calls from a person who identified himself as a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). He demanded one million pesos for protection of her family but did not give a deadline with respect to when it should be paid. The applicant suspected she was targeted for extortion because she had family members living in the USA and was therefore perceived to have access to resources. In October of that same year, the FARC forced their way into her parents' home and terrorized her parents, sisters and nephew."], ["[3]", "The applicant left Colombia on February 15, 2002 and went back to the United States. Four months later, on June 8, 2002, her children flew to meet her. After her visitor's visa ran out she entered into an arranged marriage of convenience for a fee. Her husband disappeared before her permanent residence papers could be finalized. Her conditional permanent residence status was thus cancelled by U.S. immigration at which point she came to Canada and applied for refugee protection here.", "DECISION UNDER REVIEW"], ["[4]", "The Board did not find the material aspects of the principal applicant's story to be credible nor did it find her fear well-founded. It found the timing of the FARC call to be not credible, namely because it came so shortly after she returned to Colombia. Further, she admitted that no deadline was imposed on the payment of the extortion money. The Board also did not believe, on a balance of probabilities, and based on the Board's National Documentation Package, that should the applicant and her children return to Colombia, eight years after she left, that they would be targeted by the FARC."], ["[5]", "Furthermore, the principal applicant did not file a claim for asylum in the seven years and seven months she lived in the United States because she said she had a tourist visa that lasted five years. The Board found that if she were truly in fear of imminent deportation by the end of the fifth year, she would have looked into filing an asylum claim in order to prevent deportation. Finally, the Board drew an adverse inference from the fact that when her parents and two sisters left Colombia for the United States in November 2001, the principal applicant voluntarily stayed behind to arrange for someone to look after their properties. She left the country three months later. The Board considered that someone who truly fears persecution would flee at their first opportunity.", "ISSUES"], ["[6]", "The determinative issue is whether the Board reasonably concluded that the principal applicant's story was not credible or based on a well-founded fear of persecution?", "ANALYSIS", "Standard of Review"], ["[7]", "The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board is a specialized tribunal which is owed deference by this Court, especially insofar as their findings concern the plausibility of testimony and the credibility of an account:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 17) and intervention is only warranted if the decision does not fall within a range of \"possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\":", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] 1 S.C.R. at para. 47.", "Did the Board reasonably conclude that the principal applicant's story was not credible or based on a well-founded fear of persecution?"], ["[8]", "Whether the Board reasonably concluded that the principal applicant's story was not credible or based on a well-founded fear of persecution requires the Court to analyse the Board's findings with respect to: (a) the applicant's credibility; (b) the applicant's delay in seeking protection; (c) the likelihood that the FARC would have a continued interest in targeting her; and (d) the Board's appreciation of the documentary evidence.", "(a)", "Credibility"], ["[9]", "It is well established that when assessing the credibility of a refugee claimant, the Board is entitled to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) at para. 2;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J.

The Board found it curious that the alleged call came almost immediately following her return to Colombia from the United States. Given the timing of this call, it was reasonable for the Board to doubt the credibility of this allegation. Related to this finding is the admission the applicant made at the hearing: that the FARC did not impose a deadline for the extortion monies. It was reasonable for the Board to conclude that a deadline for payment is a \"crucial element of an extortion demand\" as the deadline serves to effectively trigger the threat. This was a conclusion grounded in common sense and rationality."], ["[11]", "The credibility of the applicant's story was further undermined by the lack of any objective, corroborating evidence about the alleged extortion attempt. The applicant argues that the lack of corroboration should have been relevant only to a state protection finding. I agree that documentary evidence of a complaint to a police authority is, strictly speaking, merely evidence of the statement by the claimant to the police. It does not corroborate the occurrence of the alleged events. Nonetheless, documentary evidence of a complaint is at least a contemporaneous record which would have some value in supporting a claim that the events had occurred as claimed. Here, the Board was looking for anything that would provide such support."], ["[12]", "When a refugee claimant's credibility is already called into question it is justifiable for a Board to draw a negative inference from his or her failure to corroborate material elements of their story:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 32;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 18;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 7.

The letter stated that the reason the applicant left for the U.S.A. was because of threats made against her in Colombia. Such letters often come from family and friends close to the persons affected by the claimed events as only they may have personal knowledge of what had occurred. However, in the circumstances of this matter and given the applicant's already impugned credibility it was not unreasonable for the Board to discount the letter.", "(b)", "Delay"], ["[14]", "This Court has held that delay in seeking refugee protection is an important factor to consider when weighing a claim for refugee status:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .

The same is true in the case at bar. The principal applicant remained in the United States for seven years. For five of those years she had a tourist visa. After the visa expired she still took no steps to seek protection in the United States. It was reasonable for the Board to expect that \"if she were truly in fear\" of being deported, she would have looked into the matter of filing an asylum claim as soon as possible. There is no reasonable explanation on file as to why she did not do this, other than her attempt to resort to a marriage of convenience."], ["[16]", "The applicant submits that the Board erred in reciting the chronology of events which took place during her sojourns in the U.S. I agree that the Board mistakenly referred to the expiry of her visitor's visa and her attempts to rely on a marriage of convenience as happening earlier rather than in 2005 and 2006. The Board got the chronology straight at the beginning of the decision but then conflated the history in a later paragraph. This error was not material to its decision."], ["[17]", "The applicant delayed in fleeing Colombia. She testified at the hearing that she stayed behind when her parents and sister fled because she had to arrange to have their properties looked after and to find a place in Medellin where her children would be safe as they did not have travel documents. The Board relied on the applicant's statement about the properties to draw a negative inference about her subjective fear. While this part of the decision could have been better written to acknowledge her additional concern about the children, the decision as a whole was not erroneous as the applicant had given that evidence. It was open to the Board to draw from her evidence that her principal reason for delaying was to manage the three apartments.", "(c)", "The FARC's Lack of Continued Interest in the Applicant"], ["[18]", "Although not dispositive of this application, it is worth pointing out that the applicant has been away from Colombia for 8 years and no evidence was submitted as to how she may still be of interest to the FARC if she were to return. When asked about this in the hearing, the applicant said she could be tracked down by her father's name and documents. It was not clear what she was referring to respecting documents.

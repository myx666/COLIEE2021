On September 8th he told a nurse that he feared for his life if he had to go to the administrative building without an escort. From the date of the original incident, to the date of the hearing in December, this request had been denied.

In Mr. Mahjoub's first detention review, while he was still at the MTWDC, Justice Dawson had expressed concern that no long-term programs were available as it was a remand centre. Now that he was at the KIHC, near two large federal institutions, there were still no programs available to the detainees other than recreation at the gym."], ["[62]", "Mr. Mahjoub testified that he had requested education programs and access to the library and school at Millhaven but was refused as these were operated by the Correctional Service of Canada and not by the CBSA which ran KIHC.

A controversy had arisen over exactly where the services should be provided.

In addition, Mr. Dumas indicated that if the application for judicial review was dismissed the CBSA would wait for the Supreme Court's decision with respect to the constitutionality of the security certificate process before proceeding with Mr. Mahjoub's removal.

In 1993 he worked in Toronto for four years as a counterterrorism investigator. He then returned to Ottawa where he held a succession of positions in the counterterrorism branch. He has been in his present position since May 2006. He testified on the basis of his knowledge of the CSIS file concerning Mr. Mahjoub and regarding Islamic terrorism in general."], ["[71]", "With respect to CSIS' characterization of the threat of Islamic terrorism at this time, JP stated \"that it is just about the most serious level of threat that Canada has faced\". He pointed to the threat related to Sunni Islamic terrorism in particular, and the fact that Canada had been identified as a target of Al Qaeda in formal terms since 2002, and implicitly since 1996 as a result of our perceived position as an ally to the United States and Israel. He stated further that as a result of the disruption caused to the Al Qaeda hierarchy since 9/11, the threat has become more diverse and amorphous."], ["[72]", "With respect to Mr. Mahjoub specifically, JP stated that it was CSIS' position that the applicant is a member of the Vanguards of Conquest (VOC) and has connections with key Al Qaeda figures. Mr. Mahjoub is believed by CSIS to be part of the Shura Council to the VOC, that being an advisory or decision-making body. His membership in this exclusive group speaks to his credentials as an Islamic extremist. If released into the community, he would have the potential to resume his activities, to re-initiate contact, and/or make new contacts with extremists. They do not believe that he has moderated his views or renounced the use of violence. This is based largely on the fact that he had previously lied about his connections with certain individuals. In effect, his continuing refusal to acknowledge membership in extremist organizations is perceived to support the conclusion that he continues to believe in those causes."], ["[73]", "CSIS continues to believe that Mr. Mahjoub could draw on his \"star power\" to influence impressionable young Muslims in Canada. They believe that individuals with his pedigree and track record in extremist organizations are rare. The concern is that he will connect with some of these people or be contacted by them. JP asserted that there was more than the Egyptian conviction and Mr. Mahjoub's alleged association with the VOC that indicated a propensity towards violence that had not been publicly disclosed. CSIS believes that there has been continued support for Mr. Mahjoub while he has been in detention by persons backing the Islamic extremist cause. JP acknowledged that the imposition of conditions on Mr. Mahjoub's release would make the re-initiation or continuation of contact with such individuals more difficult, and he agreed that it remained possible for the applicant to communicate with such people even while he was in detention."], ["[74]", "JP was cross-examined closely on the accuracy and reliability of the sources cited in support of the statements contained in the public summaries filed by the respondents. For example, in the May 12, 2005 summary provided for the purpose of the second detention review, CSIS disclosed that it had obtained information that Mubarak Al Duri was reported to be Osama bin Laden's principal procurement agent of WMD materials. Mr. Al Duri had worked with Mr. Mahjoub for bin Laden in the Sudan, had apparently lived for a time in Richmond, British Columbia, and may have been associated with Essam Marzouk who had also lived in that city. The source of that information was footnoted as a reference to a CIA/FBI joint analytical report cited in the Report of the 9/11 Commission. On cross-examination, JP acknowledged that he was not able to point to any other public source for that information other than the 9/11 commission report. He was also not able to point to any public evidence that would indicate that Mr. Mahjoub knew Mr. Marzuk before they each respectively and separately came to Canada."], ["[75]", "With regard to the question of release on conditions, JP observed that conditions are not a guarantee. Though they may temporarily contain an individual, or provide incentives to comply, they will not deter an individual who is determined to take flight or to resume terrorist activity. It is the position of CSIS that no conditions would guarantee that there would not be a danger to national security or to the safety of any person should Mr. Mahjoub be released. JP pointed to examples in Great Britain where persons subject to control orders had taken flight. He agreed however that the assessment of whether there will be compliance turns on the given individual and whether they will respect the sureties and the commitments they have made. He also acknowledged that a certain degree of assurance that Mr. Mahjoub would not breach his conditions would come from the presence of the sureties as well as from external monitoring through visual and electronic surveillance.

The recommended treatment requires weekly injections for a period of 48 weeks. This treatment is taxing on the body in a way similar to chemotherapy and there has to be close monitoring of the patient's blood, liver function and weight loss or gains. In Ms. Roscoe's view this can only be done in the institution's treatment room, and so long as Mr. Mahjoub is unwilling to attend at that location he will not receive the treatment.

Essentially, the applicants submit that this finding is speculative and not supported by the evidence."], ["[22]", "The applicants argue that it is incumbent on the Director to base her decision on reliable information. In this regard, the applicants question the reliability and value of the answer provided by Dr. Hindle. According to the applicants, the question posed was vague, and the response elicited by the question was not much better. There was no mention of the type of care Mrs. Bichari would require and no details surrounding the affordability or the availability of treatment were requested. There is also no way of knowing why Dr. Hindle has the required expertise to provide an accurate response to the question; all we know about her is that she is a medical attaché working in Paris, and that she is responsible for the Maghreb region."], ["[23]", "With regard to the two articles referred to by the Director, the applicants argue that (i) the 1994 article does not refer to the current situation in Algeria, and (ii) the other article does not specifically deal with the situation in Algeria and does not indicate whether immunosuppressant medicines are readily available in Algeria. Indeed, according to applicants' counsel, both articles actually contradict the Director's finding that there exists adequate post-renal transplant treatment in Algeria. Since the Director failed to explain why the contradictory evidence from the articles was not relevant, the applicants submit that the Director erred by making an erroneous finding of fact without regard for the evidence (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 157 F.T.R. 35, at paragraphs 16 and 17 (FC)). Indeed, if Canada, as one of the richest countries in the world, is not willing to provide Mrs. Bichari with the necessary drug treatment because of the excessive cost to the health system, the applicants ask how can we expect Algeria, a poor, war-torn country to provide such treatment reliably, and at an affordable cost?", "V ANALYSIS"], ["[24]", "Before entering Canada, foreign nationals are required to apply for a visa, which may or may not be granted depending on whether the foreign national complies with the other requirements of the", "Act", "(see subsection 11(1)). Subsection 25(1) of the", "Act", "provides an exemption to the requirement of having to apply for a visa from outside of Canada, in addition to providing an \"exemption from", "any", "applicable criteria or obligation of [the]", "Act", "if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to [the applicant], taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected, or by public policy considerations\" (emphasis added)."], ["[25]", "Given the discretionary nature of these decisions, it is widely accepted that the Court must show deference to the immigration officer making the determination. Since the Supreme Court of Canada's decisions in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), it is clear that the Court will review a humanitarian and compassionate decision on the reasonableness standard. In conducting its review, the Court is concerned with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. As long as the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law, the Court will not intervene with the immigration officer's decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47)."], ["[26]", "In an application based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations, the onus is always on the applicants to provide the documentation upon which the determination will be based (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Again, it has been reiterated by this Court numerous times that the humanitarian and compassionate decision making process is a highly discretionary one (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )). Furthermore, the decision of an officer not to grant an exemption under subsection 25(1) of the", "Act", "takes no right away from an applicant, who may still apply for landing from outside of Canada, which is the usual requirement under Canadian Immigration legislation ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 11)."], ["[27]", "With these general principles in mind, I will first deal with the ancillary issue raised by the applicants with respect to the reliability and weight of the two articles mentioned in the impugned decision. From a reading of same, it is clear that both articles are relevant to the issue of post-renal transplant treatment in Algeria in that they outline the strengths and the shortcomings of the North African health care system with regard to kidney patients. While the 1994 article (Hottman Salah, \"An Overview of Renal Replacement Therapy in Algeria\" (1994) 5:2 Saudi Journal of Kidney Diseases and Transplantation 190) may be dated, it is not up to the Court to tell the Director how this information should be weighed. Notably however, in the more recent article (Rashad S. Barsoum, \"End-stage renal disease in North Africa\" (2003) 63: S83 Kidney Journal S111), it is stated that \"[t] he transplant activity in North Africa is impressive ... [t] he outcome of renal transplantation in terms of patient and graft survival conforms to international standards.\" That said, the Court readily recognizes that the two articles do not deal directly with the availability of drug treatments, however, they relate to post-transplant health care, which can be inferred to include any necessary drug treatments. If the applicants wanted to question the conclusions or the inferences that could be drawn from these articles, they had ample opportunity to submit, and should have submitted, their own evidence, which they failed to do."], ["[28]", "This brings us to the reproach concerning the Director's reliance on Dr. Hindle's comments concerning the availability of health services. While we may not know whether Dr. Hindle has actually been to Algeria, the fact that she is the medical attaché for the North African region means that it was not unreasonable for the Director to rely on her statement. Indeed, she can be expected to have some expertise related to the nature of the health services provided by countries in that region. If the applicants did not agree with her conclusion, it was up to them to submit documentation to the contrary. The respondent further submits that based on Dr. Hindle's response that treatment is offered in the public sector, we may not infer that Mrs. Bichari would be able to receive her immunosuppressant medicine for free in Algeria. I agree with the applicants that the fact that the public sector offers medication does not necessarily mean that it is offered for free. That said, even if Mrs. Bichari were required to pay a subsidized price for the medication, it would not render the Director's decision unreasonable. The standard on a humanitarian and compassionate application cannot be whether the applicants will get better or more affordable treatment in Canada, because if this were the case, virtually all medically inadmissible persons would be entitled to stay."], ["[29]", "The present application must fail. It should also be noted that while better questions could have been asked by the Director in the e-mail, that is not the legal test. Suffice it to say that based on Dr. Hindle's answer provided, post-renal transplant health services are available in Algeria. Thus, without evidence to the contrary, it was reasonable for the Director to decide how she did. A recent decision of this Court confirms that an applicant cannot simply rest his or her case on the fact that the evidence relied upon by the decision-maker is speculative when he or she has simply failed to discharge the burden of proof in establishing that proper medical care is not available in their country. My colleague, Justice Phelan in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 12, noted that:", "\"... [10] This decision turns principally on the onus of proof which an applicant bears. The underlying reason for the negative decision is the failure of the Applicant to discharge the burden of proof in respect of the critical elements of the claim.", "\"[11] The Applicant argued that many of the Officer's findings were based upon speculation. This included the ability of Portugal to provide medical care and the existence of one or more members of the family in Portugal who could supply financial and emotional support for the Applicant. The Applicant also questioned the Officer's conclusion that the Applicant's mother may require assistance to continue to care for him in the future.", "\"[12] The speculative elements of the decision arose as the result of the failure of the Applicant to adduce evidence to the contrary, as was his obligation. The Officer, in concluding that Portugal could provide medical care, undoubtedly took judicial notice of the fact that Portugal is a member of the EU and as such, has a reasonable medical system. The Applicant acknowledges that he provided no evidence that medical care sufficient for the Applicant was not available in Portugal. While it might have been preferable for the Officer to simply state that the Applicant had failed to discharge the onus of proof in respect of this matter, the conclusion that Portugal, on a balance of probabilities, could provide medical care was not unreasonable. ...\""], ["[30]", "The applicants had the burden of establishing that they would suffer unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if they were sent back to Algeria. The applicants argued that they are elderly and have been in Canada for the last ten years and that they no longer feel safe in Algeria. In making a determination based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, a number of factors had to be weighed by the Director. The applicants also stressed in their written representations that prior to the finding of medical inadmissibility, the Bicharis were deemed to merit permanent resident status based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. While not raised at the hearing, suffice it to say that the emphasis on their approval in principle is misplaced in any event. This approval was contingent on the applicants satisfying the remaining requirements in the", "Act", "including, but not limited to, the requirement that the applicants be medically admissible.

The only evidence submitted by the applicants were the letters from medical doctors attesting to Mrs. Bichari's good health. In the case at bar, the Director did not make an unreasonable finding of fact in concluding that there were appropriate medical services available for Mrs. Bichari in Algeria.

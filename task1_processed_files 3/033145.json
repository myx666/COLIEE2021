Despite counsel's submissions to the contrary, this is clearly an issue of mixed fact and law, and citizenship judges are owed a degree of deference on such issues by reason of their special knowledge and expertise in these matters.

Ms Naveen was 23 years old when she became a permanent resident in Canada, she had left home at 19 to study in California until graduating in 2005, and then went to Harvard Medical School. She had never worked in Canada but did work in the United States as a college residence advisor, a teaching assistant and a research mentor. Moreover, there was no evidence showing that the Respondent was dependent on her parents to subsidise her education."], ["[22]", "It is readily apparent that the situation is quite different in the case at bar. The Respondent was a minor when she and her parents arrived in Canada, and as such she was presumably more dependent on her parents than a young adult who has left home three years before her parents arrived in Canada. With regard to the Respondent's financial dependence on her parents, the Applicant contends that there was no documentary evidence before the Citizenship judge that the Respondent was financially dependent on her parents. Yet, both a letter from the Respondent's parents dated March 22, 2012 and the Respondent's citizenship application confirmed that she was supported by her parents throughout her education. In my view, it was not unreasonable for the Citizenship judge to accept that the Respondent, as a young university student living in London, was dependent on her parents without requiring further corroborating evidence. Notably, her parents in their letter offered to provide additional bank statements to prove her dependence if required."], ["[23]", "With respect to the failure of the Respondent to return home at every available opportunity, the evidence before the Citizenship judge indicates that she did so with some regularity at least twice annually. Again, this is quite different from the situation in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where the Respondent apparently repeatedly failed to return to Canada when opportunities availed themselves."], ["[24]", "In short, the Citizenship judge had the opportunity to interview the Respondent and to assess her commitment to Canada. He came to the conclusion that she had centralized her mode of living in Canada, that her initial establishment and her subsequent visits could not properly be referred to as \"visits or stay\", and that she was significantly engaged with Canadian society when in Canada to the extent her studies permitted. The issue for the Court is not whether it would have come to the same conclusion, but whether the Citizenship judge could reasonably come to his conclusion on the basis of the record that was before him. I believe he could. While his reasons could perhaps have been more articulate, it cannot be said that they lack intelligibility or that they are not supported by the evidence.

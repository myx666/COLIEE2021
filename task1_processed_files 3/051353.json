The long-term supervision order is not akin to a regular \"statutory release\". Rather, it is a form of statutory conditional release. The NPB imposes tailored conditions. If the conditions are breached, then the offender is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for up to a ten year term (Cr.C, s.753.3(1)). Moreover, s.99 of the CCRA states that a person under a long-term supervision order is deemed to be an offender. To find that the omission of the term \"long-term supervision\" prohibits the NPB from imposing medical restrictions in a long-term supervision would also lead to the absurd result that jurisdiction exists to make treatment orders for lower risk individuals on parole, but not for long-term offenders who are subject to long-term supervision orders."], ["[82]", "To allow an Applicant to be released on a long-term supervision order without a necessary medical requirement would also be an unreasonable result. The dual intent of the legislation is to protect the public and provide reintegration through supervision within the community. In this case, it seems clear that the Applicant would not reintegrate into the community, nor would his risk to the community be sufficiently reduced without medical treatment."], ["[83]", "Without the treatment requirement, the Applicant would have likely been designated a dangerous offender."], ["[84]", "Last, Wilson J. stated that where a provision may be interpreted in more than one manner, the Court should select the interpretation that is consistent with the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.) at para. 34.) I address the Charter issues in this matter below, and suggest that the condition passes Charter scrutiny."], ["[85]", "It therefore follows that the NPB's decision to impose a treatment condition on the Applicant's long-term supervision order was correct.", "b) Charter considerations"], ["[86]", "An application was made by the Respondent whereby the Respondent stated that in order for the Applicant to make a Charter argument, it would have been necessary for the Applicant to have served a section 57 notice on the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of each province. In that I have concluded that the Charter submissions made by the Applicant are saved pursuant to s.1 of the Charter, I do not find it necessary to determine whether or not I need to examine a s.57 submission."], ["[87]", "As noted in the administrative law analysis above, the condition does not violate a principle of fundamental justice by depriving the Applicant's security of the person in a manner that was not authorized by law. Although there is no statutory language specifically identifying medical treatment as an available condition, it is clear from the statutory scheme and Parliamentary intent that the NPB has the discretionary power to impose such a condition."], ["[88]", "However, the condition may violate the principle of fundamental justice that individuals should be free from unwanted medical treatment. In my view, it is not enough for the Respondent to say that the Applicant's s.7 Charter rights have not been violated since he retains the final right to refuse treatment. The Respondent acknowledges that if the Applicant refuses treatment, he would be in breach of a condition of his release, and would likely face further incarceration. When the Applicant is required to decide whether to take medication as prescribed by a doctor, he is forced to choose between his right to security of the person and his liberty interest. Under such circumstances, the Applicant may be forced into taking medication against his better judgment. The choice between the losses of s.7 Charter rights is not a choice that the State should normally be imposing on an individual. There is therefore a prima facie violation of the Applicant's s.7 Charter rights."], ["[89]", "I am satisfied the infringement on the Applicant's s.7 Charter rights is saved under s.1. The protection of the public is a pressing and substantial objective, and the condition affirmed by the NPB is rationally connected to the objective. The condition meets the minimal impairment requirement of the Oakes test (supra). In this case, it is highly unlikely that the Applicant would have gained supervised release without the condition that he takes medication as prescribed by a physician. In this case, the condition is tailored to impair the Applicant's rights no more than is necessary ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 160)."], ["[90]", "The Applicant submits that the condition could have been made less drastic by requiring Mr. Deacon to disclose his refusal to take medication rather than making it a condition that he takes the medication. Although the proposed condition would impair the Applicant's rights to a lesser extent, this condition would not have sufficiently protected the public. The Applicant's long history of sexual offences against children has led the NPB to determine that the Applicant can only be managed with the assistance of medical treatment. The parole officer should not have to apply for additional discretionary conditions upon learning that the Applicant has refused treatment. Rather, the NPB correctly determined that the protection of the public requires that the Applicant take medication as prescribed, and that any breach of this condition immediately amounts to a breach of his long-term supervision order."], ["[91]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a necessary condition. This amounts to one of the \"exceptional circumstances\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  saved under s.1.

I am satisfied the NPB clearly had reason to be concerned for the welfare of young children. With the Applicant's record and his behaviour with children, I am satisfied this condition is a reasonable one.", "CONCLUSION:"], ["[96]", "The condition that the Applicant takes medication as prescribed by a medical doctor is upheld."], ["[97]", "The condition that the Applicant not contact any child under the age of 16, or any parent or guardian under the age of 16, is upheld.", "ORDER"], ["[98]", "THIS COURT ORDERS that the Application for judicial review is denied.

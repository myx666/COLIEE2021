Mr. Raza came to Canada in 2001 seeking refugee protection. He paid a smuggler $20,000 for passage to Canada. His claim was denied in the summer of 2003. Prior to the decision of the Refugee Protection Division, Mr. Raza met the Applicant in English as a Second Language class in Mississauga. They recount the development of their relationship as a natural progression from coffee at Tim Horton's and movies at the Square One shopping-mall, to the decision that Mr. Raza would move into the Applicant's apartment in December 2003."], ["[6]", "After Mr. Raza's refugee claim was rejected, he applied for leave and judicial review of that decision. The judicial review was dismissed in 2004. He applied for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) and submitted a Humanitarian and Compassionate application."], ["[7]", "Mr. Raza proposed to the Applicant in May 2005, and they married in August of the same year."], ["[8]", "Mr. Raza received a negative PRRA decision in December 2005.

They were later confirmed to be counterfeit documents. When Mr. Raza was interviewed, he admitted only after repeated questioning that the documents were forgeries. He was asked if the Applicant knew he had used forged documents and he replied that she did not. The immigration officer developed other concerns regarding the genuineness of the relationship between the spouses over the course of the interview and brought them to the attention of Mr. Raza. The officer had credibility concerns regarding the truthfulness of Mr. Raza's testimony, was concerned that there were serious incompatibilities in age, culture and relationship between Mr. Raza and the Applicant and expressed doubt over the lack of evidence of an on-going relationship between the parties."], ["[11]", "Based on insufficient evidence that would indicate that the relationship was genuine, the immigration officer determined that the marriage was not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status under the IRPA. As a result, Mr. Raza was not considered a spouse and was therefore not a member of the family class. The immigration officer noted in the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS):", "[...] the lack of apparent interest in or knowledge of the sponsor is very strange and it appears the obtention of Canadian status for the PA was the prime consideration behind the marriage, as his other attempts, including paying to be smuggled into Canada in order to submit a refugee claim in an attempt to obtain status had failed. PA could not provide a suitable explanation as to why he found the SP to be a suitable partner and evidence of interdependency to establish the relationship has not sufficiently been provided.", "Generally PA could not provide credible responses at interview and the fact that he submitted fraudulent documentation as part of his application and then lied about the submission of fraudulent documents only further creates questions regarding his credibility [...]"], ["[12]", "The Applicant was informed of the decision via letter dated July 4, 2008.

The IAD considered the", "bona fides", "of the marriage and found several negative factors that supported its conclusion: insufficient attempts to combine their affairs; lack of knowledge of each other's respective faith practices; e-mail communications and cards that lack substance and are primarily limited to immigration matters; and the lack of credibility of Mr. Raza's testimony with respect to his visa post interview.

The IAD was not satisfied that the Applicant discharged this burden."], ["[19]", "The Applicant disagrees with the IAD's decision and submits that the panel misstated the facts and came to unreasonable conclusions."], ["[20]", "For example, the IAD determined that the timing of the marriage supported the determination that the marriage was entered into for the purpose of acquiring status, because the couple married shortly before Mr. Raza was issued with a departure order. The Applicant argues, however, that the timing of the marriage actually contradicts this finding. The couple met and started dating in 2002. Mr. Raza's refugee claim was not rejected until 2003. The couple continued dating, and Mr. Raza proposed only in May 2005. The Applicant suggests that had Mr. Raza entered into a relationship with the Applicant with the goal of facilitating his immigration to Canada he would have proposed much sooner. Additionally, the Applicant points out that the Applicant could have applied to sponsor Mr. Raza as a common-law or conjugal partner, and therefore the couple had nothing to gain, in terms of immigration status, by choosing to marry each other. The Applicant argues that their decision to marry is consistent with the normal progression of a relationship and thus the determination that the marriage was entered into for immigration purposes is not reasonable and not supported by the facts."], ["[21]", "The Applicant also disagrees with the IAD's determination that the Applicant and Mr. Raza lack basic knowledge of each other, and submits that the IAD misstated the facts to come to the conclusion that they lack knowledge of each other's religious practices. While the IAD found that their testimonies diverged significantly when recounting the other's religious customs, the Applicant suggests that the couple provided detailed testimony regarding the other spouse's religious habits, and that the IAD is being overly microscopic."], ["[22]", "The IAD also found that the e-mails contained in the record were created to bolster the Applicant's appeal which was filed in July 2008. The Applicant again disagrees with this assessment, arguing that the e-mails do not follow a logical back-and-forth between the couple because they only represent one third of the couple's communications, the complement being made up of text messages and phone calls."], ["[23]", "To counter these submissions, the Respondent submits that as the determination that the Applicant's marriage is not bona fide is a credibility determination, it must be afforded an extremely high level of deference. The Respondent argues that the Applicant has failed to show that the decision was unreasonable. The onus was on her to demonstrate that the intention behind the marriage was not primarily directed towards acquiring status or privilege under the IRPA, and she did not do so to the IAD's satisfaction. The Respondent takes the position that the Board's factual findings were reasonably open to it and ought not be disturbed by the Court."], ["[24]", "Determining whether a marriage is genuine, and assessing the true intentions of the parties as they entered into that marriage is a difficult task fraught with many potential pitfalls. As I review the record I am cognizant of the challenge faced by the IAD in hearing such an appeal, and am mindful that as long as the IAD draws inferences that are reasonably open to it based on the evidence, it is not appropriate for the Court to interfere, even had I been tempted to come to a contrary conclusion (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 1149 at para 9)."], ["[25]", "Where there has been an oral hearing, and the IAD has had the advantage of hearing the witnesses testify viva voce, the IAD's credibility determinations are entitled to even more deference.

Thus, the IAD is being overly microscopic in relying on that inconsistency. Mr. Raza claims that he was not asked about his wife's bank account or the name of her employer during his interview at the High Commission, notwithstanding the officer's CAIPS notes recording the interview. The Applicant argues that the only person who ever talked about going to church at Easter was the hearings officer. I reviewed the transcript. Mr. Raza's response to the question of \"Did your wife ever go to church while you and her were living together?\" is recorded as, \"She would sometime <inaudible> Easter time she used to go\" (Certified Tribunal Record pg 522)."], ["[29]", "Though somewhat plausible, the Applicant's explanation for why she incorrectly identified Mr. Raza's highest level of education is not sufficient to raise a reviewable error on the part of the IAD when the entire decision is read as a whole. The IAD had other legitimate concerns regarding the", "bona fides", "of the marriage that the Applicant has not convinced me were unfounded."], ["[30]", "The Applicant argues that the evidence supports their testimony that the Applicant sends Mr. Raza money whenever he requires it. However, the IAD noted that the only financial support corroborated by the submitted documents was several hundred dollars sent in 2009 and $1000 in 2007. Furthermore, the Applicant testified that their joint bank account contains no funds, because she needed the money to spend on other things. The IAD noted that the only evidence that indicated that the couple was combining their affairs was from 2005, the year they got married. This consisted of Mr. Raza naming the Applicant as the beneficiary of his pension and benefits plan, and Mr. Raza's name appearing on an insurance quote. I agree with the Respondent that it was reasonable for the IAD to conclude that, weighed against the entirety of the evidence, these documents are insufficient to establish a genuine marriage."], ["[31]", "The last issue relates to the e-mails the couple exchanged in 2009. The IAD found that the e-mails did not contain substantive content in support of a genuine marriage, but rather often mentioned immigration and the creation of evidence to bolster their immigration appeal filed in July 2008. The Applicant disputes this assessment and in her submissions excerpts e-mail communications between the spouses relating to the weather and each other's families."], ["[32]", "While Mr. Raza often asks about the Applicant's son, and there is discussion of the weather and other menial affairs, it was reasonably open to the IAD to conclude that, on a balance of probabilities, the documents did not sufficiently establish the genuineness of the marriage. Though the exchange suggests that the parties greatly miss each other's physical presence, there are many emphatic comments related to the need to provide evidence for the purpose of the immigration appeal. For instance, Mr. Raza in various e-mails, wrote:", "...if u don't send me masgs and not to many emails then how u proof our relationship to the immigration that we r together even u don't vist me since 3 years so we need stronge proof like phone bills emails lots of masgs if u realy understand that ...

The explanations given by the IAD are not unreasonable, and the decision as a whole is justified, transparent and intelligible. Based on the evidence before the IAD, it was not unreasonable to conclude that the Applicant failed to establish that she and her husband were in a genuine marriage that Mr. Raza had not entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring immigration status. The intervention of this Court is not warranted.", "V.

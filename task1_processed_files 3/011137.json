He alleged that he was persecuted in his country by reason of his political opinions and his membership in a particular social group."], ["[3]", "It appears from the analysis contained in the reasons for the Refugee Division's decision that the panel concluded the applicant did not have a subjective fear of persecution. This is fundamentally a finding of fact pertaining to the existence of the fear of persecution in the refugee's mind (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 723  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).

Suffice it to refer to the two-and-a-half year delay, noted by the panel, in claiming refugee status in Canada, and the two trips the applicant took outside of his country (to Tunisia, Italy and Thailand), which he did not take advantage of to claim refugee status and following which he simply returned to his own country. It was also relevant for the panel to note that one of these trips lasted about two months and the applicant did not use it to go and join a part of his family that is living in Canada."], ["[6]", "The delay in claiming refugee status, which is not explained, as in this case, is an important factor in determining the lack of a subjective fear of persecution (see, for example,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at page 223).

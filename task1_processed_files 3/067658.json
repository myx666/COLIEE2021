ED is an extremely common medical condition believed to affect upwards of 50 percent of men aged 40 to 70."], ["[5]", "A muscle is usually considered to be in its resting state when relaxed. In the case of the penis, the reverse is true. The penis contains two symmetrical compartments above and on either side of the urethra, each of which is called a corpus cavernosum. They consist of small blood vessels or passages surrounded by smooth muscle which can contract or relax as with any form of muscle. When constricted, the smooth muscle restricts the flow of blood through the blood vessels in the arterial network entering the corpora cavernosa, acting much like a ligature. Blood exits the corpora cavernosa through veins at approximately the same rate as it enters through the arteries, maintaining the penis in a non-erect state. When an erection is triggered, the smooth muscle surrounding the vessels in the arterial network and the cavernous smooth muscle relax, no longer constricting the arteries delivering blood to the corpora cavernosa. Blood then floods into the highly vascularized tissue of the corpora cavernosa, causing them to swell. That swelling, in turn, squeezes the venules of the membrane enclosing the corpora cavernosa, thereby reducing the size of their internal passages and reducing their ability to drain blood from the corpora cavernosa. The result is that the penis becomes engorged with blood and rigid."], ["[6]", "Relaxation of smooth muscle in the penis is therefore a key to the erectile process. What, then, causes smooth muscle to relax and contract? Smooth muscle, which is found in many parts of the body, is under the control of the involuntary autonomic system. Smooth muscle relaxation results from a cascade or series of highly complex biochemical reactions within the body involving chemical messengers operating on communication systems called \"pathways\"."], ["[7]", "By the priority date of the '784 Patent, it was known that there are many different pathways that lead to penile smooth muscle relaxation. The pathway to which the Patent is directed is the NO/cGMP pathway. In this pathway, sexual stimulation results in the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) nerves releasing nitric oxide (NO). Upon stimulation, the NANC nerves release a flood or rush, of NO. It is known that this flood of NO is primarily responsible for producing an erection."], ["[8]", "The nitric oxide diffuses through the cell membrane. Inside the cell, the nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase to convert guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). An increase in the amount of cGMP inside a smooth muscle cell leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle and eventually to an erection."], ["[9]", "A class of enzymes known as phosphodiesterases (PDEs) also regulates the intracellular concentrations of the cGMP. One of these PDEs, PDE V, breaks down the cGMP to its non-cyclic form, GMP. In contrast to cGMP, GMP does not cause smooth muscle relaxation. Tadalafil works by inhibiting PDE V, thereby preventing PDE V from breaking down cGMP to the inactive GMP. Increased concentrations of cGMP then facilitate smooth muscle relaxation."], ["[10]", "Tadalafil was initially developed by Drs. Daugan and Grondin and their colleagues at GlaxoSmithKline (Glaxo).

Sildenafil citrate had been discovered only shortly before the patent for the compound tadalafil (the '377 Patent) was filed. Prior to the discovery of sildenafil citrate, the important conceptual limitations were the general belief and understanding that a general vasodilator, while being able to enhance blood flow to the penis, would almost certainly also evoke significant generalized systemic hypotension to the detriment of the individual and, as a consequence, likely be of little clinical utility. Previous experimental work in the area of erectile dysfunction had demonstrated the lack of efficacy of earlier oral agents and the widespread use and acceptance of drugs that were injected directly into the penis was believed to be the gold standard therapy delivery system at the time (1990-1994)."], ["[37]", "The understanding of the potential therapeutic role of NANC nerve pathway effectors and the identification of PDE inhibitors was also known at that time (July 1995), although it was not known how that might be achieved. Several leading experts had speculated that use of a cGMP PDE inhibitor could be considered for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, but this was not done. The leading research was designed to study the physiological pathways involved in the erectile process; it was not focused on the development of a clinical drug to treat the condition. The experts acknowledged that further research was required before there would be any realistic ability to target a specific mechanism through which erectile dysfunction could be treated. In 1994 and 1995, the leading researchers continued to investigate the use of a nitric oxide donor for the treatment of impotence, as many believed that this would be a better alternative than PDE inhibition."], ["[38]", "Therefore further research and investigation were required before one would have been able to predict that the use of a PDE V inhibitor, let alone an orally administered PDE V inhibitor, would be efficacious in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It was unknown that an orally administered PDE V inhibitor could be effective in treating erectile dysfunction because of the expected systemic effects of administering such a compound orally. According to Dr. Brock, \"[t]hat there would exist selectivity in the distribution of PDE enzymes in the penile circulation to a level not found in other essential vascular structures would have been fool-hardy speculation\" (Brock affidavit, para 33, Application Record (AR) Vol 2, p 193)."], ["[39]", "The nature of the ability of a PDE V inhibitor such as sildenafil citrate as a selective PDE V inhibitor to be an effective and safe oral agent for the use of enhancing erectile function in men was fortuitous and insightful. While there was now the idea that PDE V inhibitors could be used clinically, the complete understanding of how best to inhibit cGMP metabolism and augment erectile mechanisms was still in an infantile state. While sildenafil changed the thinking, it did not do so entirely or immediately, as changing scientific theories takes time. Theoretically, any selective and potent PDE V inhibitor could possibly work but one could not say that it was self-evident that it would work, as many characteristics such as metabolism, side effects and absorption of these new agents all needed to be tested."], ["[40]", "The inventive concept found in claims 2, 4, 12, 14 and 15 is the treatment of erectile dysfunction using tadalafil or 3-methyl tadalafil.

The \"gold-standard\" drug treatment for ED in 1994 did not involve oral pills but did involve the injection of vasodilator drugs into the corpus cavernosum. Vasodilator medications in 1994 could not be administered systemically (e.g. orally) for the treatment of ED, as this led to smooth muscle relaxation throughout the vasculature and serious hypotension could result. Systemic vasodilation, a common mechanism of oral antihypertensive drugs, actually causes ED rather than treats it."], ["[45]", "In 1994, penile erection was known to occur after smooth muscle relaxation of the penis. The neurologic system, including the NANC nerves, the central nervous system, and the peripheral nervous system were, in part, implicated in affecting penile erection.

In 1994, it was also known that the vascular system and the endocrine system were in part affecting penile erection."], ["[46]", "Dr. Goldstein also states that a handful of basic science groups were examining the mechanism of action of nitric oxide/cGMP on smooth muscle relaxation in penile tissue, but it had not been demonstrated conclusively that nitric oxide was the NANC transmitter to the exclusion of other NANC vasodilator substances. Research was focussed primarily on increasing the production of cGMP with nitric oxide donors. There was minimal research on preventing the degradation of cGMP within the cell (PDE inhibitors). Moreover, the distribution of PDE enzymes in the corpus cavernosum was not known publicly until 1999."], ["[47]", "Finally, Dr. Goldstein indicates that the publication of Pfizer's patent on the use of sildenafil and related compounds as treatments for impotence in December 1994 was the first public disclosure of an invention claiming that a PDE inhibitor, taken orally and present systemically, could effectively treat erectile dysfunction in men. The mechanism of the preferential therapeutic activity for sildenafil and related compounds was not fully understood until a study examining the selective tissue distribution of PDE V was published in 1999. Therefore, \"the claims for sildenafil in Pfizer's 1994 patents served as a prototype for an orally active therapy for the treatment of ED, but did not yet provide a rational basis for the development of other selective PDE V inhibitors. Further, the potency, selectivity, and safety of other compounds with chemical structures unrelated to sildenafil could not have been predicted in 1994\" (Goldstein affidavit, para 16, AR Vol 2, pp 275-276).

Indeed, in the context of their obviousness analysis, both Dr. Melman and Dr. Murray stated in their affidavit that a person skilled in the art \"would have a reasonable expectation that tadalafil would work to treat ED by this route of administration\" (i.e. by direct injection) (Melman affidavit, para 25, AR Vol 10, p 1817) and that the use of tadalafil to treat ED by direct injection \"would have been obvious to the Skilled Person in light of the 377 Patent claims\" (Murray affidavit, para 23, AR 10, p 1753).

I agree with Lilly, however, that it could be soundly predicted from the '377 Patent that tadalafil, claimed in the '784 Patent, would be orally bioavailable in humans. Example 122 of the '377 Patent demonstrates that a wide variety of the tetracyclic compounds were orally bioavailable in rats, and Dr. Goldstein stated that if a compound was orally bioavailable in rats, it is 99.99% certain that it would also be bioavailable in humans: Goldstein cross-examination, p 59, AR Vol 14, p 2715.

Dr. Melman agreed with that assumption on cross-examination, and accepted that it would have been reasonable for the person of skill in the art to assume, in 1995, that a PDE V inhibitor could be efficacious for the treatment of ED if it is known to have bioavailability: Melman cross-examination, pp 28-29, AR Vol 19, pp 3967-3968. Counsel for Mylan made much of the fact that Dr. Melman was asked to disregard his concern about safety and merely agreed with a hypothetical question. This may well be the case, but the safety concern is unrelated to bioavailability and shall be addressed head-on, later in these reasons."], ["[104]", "The real concern at the time had to do with the systemic hypotension caused by PDE V inhibitors. Even if a particular compound was orally bioavailable, it was thought unlikely that it could have a selective effect in the penis while avoiding systemic side effects. A drug that was expected to have an effect on the smooth muscle of the penis would also be expected to have an effect on the smooth muscle located in other parts of the body. Scientists thus expected that the vasodilatory effects of a systemically-administered PDE V inhibitor would be seen throughout the body, resulting in a systemic hypotensive effect that could lead to dangerously low blood pressure. Indeed, vasodilation was known to cause, rather than treat, ED. As Dr. Goldstein stated in his affidavit:", "In 1994, a skilled urologist would have understood that a drug could not be administered systemically for the treatment of ED, as it would not be possible to deliver a sufficiently high concentration of the drug to the penis to effectively and reliably relax the vascular smooth muscle without having an effect on the other smooth muscle in the body (e.g. hypotension).", "(Goldstein affidavit, para 49, AR Vol 2, p 285.

It is apparently on that basis that they predicted that tadalafil and 3-methyl tadalafil could be used to treat impotence.

During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells. Nitric oxide then stimulates the cytosolic enzyme guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP which results in a decrease in intracellular calcium and allows relaxation of smooth muscle cells. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozymes, which are distributed in various tissues, specifically hydrolyse cyclic nucleotides, such as cGMP. Therefore, a pharmacological agent which inhibits the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase isozyme, should enhance the action of nitric oxide/cGMP on penile erectile activity and have the potential to enhance penile erections during sexual stimulation.", "(Potter affidavit, Exh \"E\", AR Vol 6, p 1131)"], ["[109]", "This study was critical as it showed that the main PDE activity in human corpora cavernosa is due to PDE V, and that sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of PDE V, had suitable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties (rapid absorption, relatively short half-life, no significant effect on heart rate and blood pressure) for an oral agent to be taken prior to sexual activity. Indeed, the study showed that there were no clinically significant effects on pulse rate, blood pressure and laboratory safety tests following administration of single oral doses of up to 200 mg to healthy volunteers (Potter affidavit, Exh \"E\", AR Vol 6, pp 1134-1135). This information would have provided reassurance that a PDE V inhibitor could be administered orally at dosage levels where an ED effect is observed without hypotensive side effects: see Brock affidavit, para 248, AR Vol 2, p 256; Goldstein affidavit, para 231, AR Vol 2, pp 336-337."], ["[110]", "Mylan claims that this study is irrelevant to sound prediction as it is focused on sildenafil and gives no information about tadalafil.

It is also clear, however, that when that paper states that \"a pharmacological agent which inhibits the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase isozyme, should enhance the action of nitric oxide/cGMP on penile erectile activity and have the potential to enhance penile erections during sexual stimulation\", it refers not only to sildenafil and structural analogues, but also to all pharmacological agents having the same mode of actions, i.e. to pharmacological agents inhibiting PDE V.

This is understandable, given that the analysis is confined to a comparison between the claims in two patents, and does not involve an inquiry into the prior art as would be the case if the alleged invalidity rested on an argument of obviousness. Viewed in this light, the evolution of the science between the two patents should be of no consequence in an obviousness-type double patenting analysis: contrary to the position taken by the Respondent, the question is not whether the use of tadalafil to treat ED was obvious in light of the '377 Patent, in which case admissible prior art would be relevant, but whether the claims of the '784 Patent disclose novelty or ingenuity over the '377 Patent. To resolve that question, the Court (with the help of the persons skilled in the art) must look at the first patent in the context of what was known at the time, with a view to determine whether the claims in the second patent are patentably distinct from those of the earlier patent. Since the rationale behind this ground of invalidity is the prohibition against an improper extension of the monopoly granted by the first patent, the Court must ascertain whether the invention claimed in the second patent could or should have been included in the first patent."], ["[134]", "If, as Mylan would have it, the relevant date was to be the priority date of the second patent (in this case, July 14, 1995), the obviousness-type double patenting analysis would morph into a pure obviousness analysis, with the added benefit that the timing requirements of section 28.3 of the", "Patent Act", "would be circumvented. It is quite telling that Mylan's written and oral argument relied heavily on the framework for obviousness developed by the Supreme Court in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", ", above. To be fair, both sides have at times confused the issue, and all four experts were instructed to consider the issue of double patenting as of July 14, 1995. For the reasons already given, this priority date of the '784 Patent cannot be the relevant date. One cannot read into the claims of the first patent more than what would have been understood by the person skilled in the art at the claim date when comparing the claims of the second patent to those of the first patent. If the focus is to be on the claims, as the Supreme Court teaches in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", ", information published after the claim date of the first patent is of no use to determine whether the claims of the second patent are patentably distinct from the claims of the first one. This is indeed what my colleague Justice Hughes found in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", ", above, where he held that certain documents published immediately before the claim date of the second patent rendered the invention non-obvious, but nevertheless determined that these documents were non-existent as far as the obviousness-type double patenting inquiry was concerned."], ["[135]", "If January 1994 (the priority date of the '377 Patent) is the relevant date for assessing obviousness-type double patenting, it is clear that the use of tadalafil to treat ED (especially by way of oral administration) would not have been obvious for a person skilled in the art. I need not spend much time with respect to that finding, as Mylan's own expert agreed on cross-examination that he would not have known of the potential for oral use of PDE V inhibitors in the treatment of ED in January of 1994: Melman cross-examination, pp 28-30, AR Vol 19, pp 3967-3969.

According to Dr. Brock, it was only a \"matter of speculation\" among leading researchers, even in late 1993, whether one might use a PDE V inhibitor and oral administration was not even speculated: Brock affidavit, para 266, AR Vol 2, p 259. Similarly, Dr. Goldstein opined that as of May 1994, the idea that smooth muscle relaxation of the corpus cavernosa and erection could be induced by the administration of a PDE V inhibitor had not been determined in humans: Goldstein affidavit, para 107, AR Vol 2, p 301. In fact, Dr. Goldstein stated that before the introduction of sildenafil, which was well after January 1994, a person skilled in the art would have expected that the systemic administration of antihypertensives would have created a risk that the drug would cause ED in the patient, rather than treat ED: Goldstein affidavit, paras 80-81 AR Vol 2, pp 293-294."], ["[137]", "My colleague Justice Mosley came to a similar conclusion in a case relating to a patent claiming the use of VIAGRA sildenafil to treat ED. The date for determining obviousness in that case was June 1993, and the prior art relied upon was common in many respects to the prior art referred to in the case at bar. The Court found that, as late as 1997, there remained conjecture as to whether the NO/cGMP pathway was the major factor in penile erection, and there continued to be concerns about the safety or oral treatment with PDE V inhibitors (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED). The Court accepted the evidence of Dr. Brock, one of Pfizer's experts in that case, and concluded that in 1993, a few scientists had merely speculated that PDE inhibition might be a factor in erectile tissue physiology, and that none of them arrived at the solution of using oral administration of sildenafil as a PDE V inhibitor in the treatment of ED. As Justice Mosley wrote (at para 125):", "Although there was a significant amount of evidence indicating that cGMP PDE inhibitors should be further explored with regards to the treatment of ED in the months leading up to the Pfizer discovery, the evidence does not in my view establish that the solution taught by the patent was obvious at the time. At best there was speculation, which in hindsight proved to be correct, that PDE5 inhibitors might treat impotence.

Mylan takes objection on the basis that Lilly and its partner ICOS took exactly the reverse position when opposing the grant of a Pfizer patent by the EPO. It is true that on the face of the documents attached to Ms. Yau's affidavit and to which I have already referred, ICOS seems to have made the argument that a person skilled in the art would have inferred from the Rajfer 1992 paper that a PDE V inhibitor would have potential for the treatment of impotence. This is far from sufficient, however, to support the Respondent's thesis that the use of a PDE V inhibitor for the treatment of ED would have been known in early 1994."], ["[139]", "First of all, the patents at issue before the EPO were not the same as those at play in the case at bar. Moreover, the proceeding wherein ICOS' submissions were made in Europe has no equivalent in Canada. More importantly, there is no evidence as to how European law may or may not be the same or different from Canadian law. Finally, we have no idea how the EPO ruled in that case. For these reasons alone, the submissions that were made by ICOS in a foreign jurisdiction are insufficient to impeach the credibility of the Applicant."], ["[140]", "In any event, it is for the Court to determine, in the last resort and with the help of the experts, to assess what was obvious at any relevant date. I agree with Dr. Brock that the Rajfer 1992 paper was a basic research study designed to investigate the role, if any, of one particular pathway (the NANC pathway) involved in the erectile process. The conclusion of the authors, as formulated in the abstract of the paper, supports this view:", "Our findings support the hypothesis that nitric oxide is involved in the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmission that leads to the smooth-muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum that permits penile erection. Defects in this pathway may cause some forms of impotence.", "(Potter affidavit, Exh \"D\", Doc #13, AR Vol 5, p 650)", "See also Brock affidavit, paras 125-144, AR Vol 2, pp 218-225"], ["[141]", "My colleague Justice Mosley also agreed with Dr. Brock that this study was very speculative and did not come up with definitive conclusions (\"It is conceivable that impairment of this pathway could account for the impairment in relaxation elicited by electrical-field stimulation [...] interference with [this pathway] could be one cause of impotence that is treatable by the administration of direct-acting vasodilators\": Rajfer 1992, p 94, AR Vol 5, p 654; see Justice Mosley's discussion in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", ", above, at paras 89-98).

In other words, it cannot be said that the '784 Patent is an evergreening of the '377 Patent when it claims a new use of tadalafil by any route of administration, or at the very least a new use of tadalafil by way of oral administration."], ["[143]", "If, contrary to my earlier finding, the relevant date to determine whether the '784 Patent is an improper extension of the '377 Patent is July 14, 1995 ('784 Patent priority date) rather than January 21, 1994 ('377 Patent priority date), would Mylan's argument be more compelling? I do not think so."], ["[144]", "The only publication of significance that occurred between the '377 priority date and the '784 priority date was the '902 Application (Pfizer's international patent application for sildenafil), upon which Mylan essentially relies in support of its argument that the use of tadalafil to treat ED was obvious when reading the '377 claims in light of the skilled person's common general knowledge in July 1995. Mylan argued that this application confirmed that a potent and selective PDE V inhibitor could enhance cGMP levels in the corpus cavernosum, thus facilitating penile erection. Most importantly, it allegedly taught that this mechanism was operative", "in vivo", "in humans with ED and could be successfully exploited to treat their condition. Since the '377 Patent taught that the compounds of the invention, including tadalafil, were potent and selective inhibitors of PDE V, it was therefore obvious to try tadalafil in the treatment of ED."], ["[145]", "This argument is fraught with a number of difficulties. First of all, the Canadian equivalent of the '902 Application was severely criticized by the Supreme Court as being deliberately obscure and did not meet the disclosure requirements set out in the", "Patent Act", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). The Court described the claims as follows (at para 4):", "The specification for Patent'446 [the Canadian equivalent of the '902 Application] explains that the invention concerns the use of a \"compound of formula (I)\" or a \"salt thereof\" as a medicament for the treatment of ED. [...] Claim 1 sets out formula (I), which produces 260 quintillion possible compounds. Claims 2 to 5 are for successively smaller ranges of compounds of formula (I), with Claim 5 being narrowed down to a range of nine compounds. Claims 6 and 7 relate to a single compound each."], ["[146]", "Only sildenafil, the subject of claim 7 and the active compound of VIAGRA, had been shown to be effective in treating ED at the time of the patent application. Although the patent included the statement that \"one of the especially preferred compounds induces penile erection in impotent males\", the patent application did not disclose that the compound that works is sildenafil or that the remaining compounds had not been found to be effective in treating ED. In", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", ", the Supreme Court found that the disclosure in the specification would not have enabled the public to make the same successful use of the invention as the inventor could at the time of his application, because it does not indicate that sildenafil is the effective compound (at paras 69-80). The '902 Application was even less specific, as the compounds identified were even less selective and did not contain a specific claim to sildenafil; it was only one of the nine especially preferred compounds."], ["[147]", "Not only was there nothing in the '902 Application to suggest that the especially preferred compound was sildenafil, but at the time of Pfizer's patent publication (December 22, 1994), the person skilled in the art's understanding of ED and PDE action in smooth muscle was counterintuitive to the claims of Pfizer's patent. In an article published in November 1995, Dr. Morales (in a section specifically addressing what was to become known as sildenafil) voiced \"concern\" that any PDE inhibitor would cause systemic problems (Potter affidavit, Exh \"E\", Doc #3, AR Vol 6, p 1121). I accept, therefore, Dr. Goldstein's opinion in this respect, according to whom \"the claims for sildenafil in Pfizer's 1994 patents served as a prototype for an orally active therapy for the treatment of ED, but did not yet provide a rational basis for the development of other selective PDE V inhibitors\" (Goldstein affidavit, para 16, AR Vol 2, p 275). In other words, it would not have been obvious for the person skilled in the art in the summer of 1995 to use tadalafil or 3-methyl tadalafil to treat ED. As a result, there is no basis to find that this invention could or should have been included in the '377 Patent, even when read in light of the state-of-the-art understanding in July 1995 of the physiology of penile erection and PDE action in smooth muscle."], ["[148]", "Mylan made much of the fact that Dr. Brock heavily relied on the evidence that he had previously given in the litigation over the use of sildenafil to treat ED (the", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "case mentioned earlier), and went as far as stating that \"[b]y recycling his earlier evidence wholesale without turning his mind to the differences in the state of the art between June 1993, May 1994, and July 1995, Dr. Brock has failed to assist the Court in understanding the common general knowledge of the Skilled Person as of the Priority Date\" (Mylan's Memorandum of Fact and Law, para 161). It is no doubt true that in reviewing the literature cited by Mylan, Dr. Brock borrowed substantially from his previous affidavit, but this is normal since the literature referred to in the two cases was very similar. He did, however, update his opinion and turned his mind specifically to the '902 Application. Since there was nothing else of significance in the scientific literature cited by Mylan between January 1994 and July 1995, Dr. Brock cannot be blamed for having relied to a large extent on his previous affidavit in the", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED", "case.

Sound prediction calls for a", "prima facie", "reasonable inference, whereas obviousness requires that it be evident an alleged invention will work. This is precisely why it is not inconsistent either to determine that the promise of the '784 Patent is soundly predicted but that it was not obvious (to say nothing of the fact that sound prediction is to be determined about a year later in the case at bar).

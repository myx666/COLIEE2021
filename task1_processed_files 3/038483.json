On March 12, 2007 the applicant requested that removal be deferred until a decision is rendered on his application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds (H&C application).

The applicant states that while he filed the PRRA forms, he did not file any personal information, submissions, or evidence in support since he was not aware of the importance of the PRRA.

The Enforcement Officer stated at page 3 of her Reasons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Medical information that accompanied this deferral request and the information on file was sent to the Medical Services Branch for their assessment and evaluation regarding this case. The Medical Services Branch indicated that the drug, risperidone was available in Jamaica.

In support, the applicant cites the decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), where Mr. Justice Rothstein, sitting as a Trial Judge, stated at paragraph 20 about \"extrinsic evidence\":  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"¶ 20 ... In the case at bar, having regard to the words 'not brought forward by the applicant' used by Hugessen, J.A., to qualify the term 'extrinsic evidence', and his reference to", "Muliadi", ", I interpret the term 'extrinsic evidence not brought forward by the applicant' as evidence of which the applicant is unaware because it comes from an outside source. This would be evidence of which the applicant has no knowledge and on which the immigration officer intends to rely in making a decision affecting the applicant. While this would include information obtained from an outside party as  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ", I fail to see why it would not also include evidence from a spouse obtained separately from the applicant, or other information in the immigration file that did not come from the applicant, of which the applicant could not reasonably be expected to have knowledge.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"¶ 21 The relevant point as I see it is whether the applicant had knowledge of the information so that he or she had the opportunity to correct prejudicial misunderstandings or misstatements. The source of the information is not of itself a differentiating matter as long as it is not known to the applicant. The question is whether the applicant had the opportunity of dealing with the evidence. This is what the long-established authorities indicate the rules of procedural fairness require. In the well known words of Lord Loreburn L.C. in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (H.L.) at page 182:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "'They can obtain information in any way they think best, always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to their view.' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "Based on this interpretation, the applicant submits that the evidence of the Medical Services Branch was \"extrinsic evidence\" since it was unknown to the applicant when the Enforcement Officer rendered her decision and was critical in the determination not to defer the applicant's removal.

The question is whether the disclosure of the report was required to provide Mr. Haghighi with a reasonable opportunity in all the circumstances to participate in a meaningful manner in the decision-making process.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"¶ 27 Hence, in deciding whether disclosure ... is required, the Court must consider, inter alia, the factors identified by L'Heureux-Dubé, J., for locating on the fairness spectrum the duties owed by the immigration officer ... The inquiry into what is required to satisfy the duty of fairness must be contextualized: asking ... whether the report can be characterised as 'extrinsic evidence' is no longer an adequate analytical approach. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "The efficient administration of section 48 of the", "IRPA", "dictates that disclosure should not generally be required. By the time a deferral request is made, the individual facing deportation is likely to have already exhausted the many other avenues available to them under the", "IRPA", ", each of which contains its own set of procedural safeguards. Accordingly, requiring an Enforcement Officer to inform the applicant of the expert opinion of the Medical Services Branch, and to further allow the applicant to comment on that opinion, would undermine the efficiency of the immigration process. As the respondent states, to require what the applicant suggests would impose a procedural formality on Enforcement Officers inimical to the proper performance of their statutory duties.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "The Enforcement Officer is statutorily bound to remove the applicant as soon as reasonably practicable. However, if the Officer relies on extrinsic evidence not brought forward by the applicant, the applicant must be given an opportunity to respond to that evidence. That is the minimal duty of procedural fairness. In the application at bar, the Enforcement Officer relied on detailed evidence about medical conditions in Jamaica that the applicant contested in an Affidavit of Melinda Gayda, filed in support of the applicant's successful motion for a stay of removal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "I question whether the Enforcement Officer ought to have conducted a \"mini H&C\" by investigating the medical services available for the applicant in Jamaica before deciding whether to defer the removal of the applicant pursuant to section 48 of the", "IRPA", ". The decision with respect to deferral is not a \"mini H&C.\" The respondent argues that a decision under section 48 is a \"pressure cooker\" decision with tight time frames, and the Enforcement Officer should not be expected to provide the applicant with an opportunity to respond to information obtained by the Enforcement Officer in making the decision. The Court cannot agree. If the Enforcement Officer is relying on extrinsic evidence, the duty of fairness applies. However, in most situations the Enforcement Officer does not need to rely on extrinsic evidence in making a decision. As I indicated, I do not think the Enforcement Officer needed to obtain the information about the medical services available in Jamaica before deciding whether to defer the removal of the applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "With respect to tight time frames, the applicant has been in Canada for 20 years, and the duty of fairness should not be sacrificed because of an artificial deadline established by the respondent for the applicant's removal. There is no harm in allowing the applicant another week or two in order to respond to extrinsic evidence upon which the Enforcement Officer intends to rely. If that extrinsic evidence is incorrect, the applicant will suffer great harm.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Mootness  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "Both parties urged the Court not to dismiss this application for mootness. I do think the case is moot since, at this point of time as a result of the stay, there is no effective removal order. However, I agreed to consider this principle of procedural fairness since it is an important point of contention between the parties and is not moot in that respect. At the same time, I do not agree that this matter raises a serious issue of general importance that has not already been decided by the jurisprudence. In my view, the jurisprudence has established unequivocally that the duty of procedural fairness applies to important extrinsic evidence being relied upon by an administrative decision maker regardless of whether it is with respect to a decision not to defer the removal or to some other decision under the", "IRPA", ".

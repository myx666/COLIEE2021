OOCL did so pursuant to a slot agreement which it had entered into with CP. This explains why the Canmar Pride was loaded with the Ford containers at Le Havre, France, for transport to Montreal for discharge there and furtherance to Ford plants in the United States under Bills of Lading issued in France by OOCL naming Ford Aquitaine as the shipper and Ford plants in the U.S. as consignees.

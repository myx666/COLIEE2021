Given the fact that in Haiti most of the population is poor, those with money or those perceived to have money are at greater risk than the general population.

My reading of the decision reveals that he applicant's status as a victim of gang violence and extortion in the past was uncontested, nor does the Board appear to rule out that he may be a victim in the future.

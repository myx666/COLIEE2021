All of these RAD decisions share the same common characteristic; they were all issued between July 24, 2013, and January 30, 2014, some four months before this Court was first asked to examine the legality of a RAD decision in which this same reasoning was applied ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, dated May 26, 2014). In all but two instances in which it was determined that the results were reasonable despite faulty reasoning by the Member ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above), the Court decided to set aside the RAD's decision and return the appeal to the RAD for redetermination.", "General position of the parties"], ["[8]", "Unsurprisingly, the applicant is arguing that the decision dated November 7, 2013, by Member Bissonnette should meet the same fate as the other RPD decisions set aside by the Court. In the present case, correctness is the applicable standard of review. Indeed, sections 110 and 111 of the IRPA make to reference to any standard of review or to any concept of deference whatsoever. If the decision of the RAD is wrong in law, in fact or in mixed law and fact, the RAD may set it aside and substitute the determination that should have been made. Parliament in fact intended to create a \"full appeal\" before the RAD. In this case, it was not enough for Member Bissonnette to simply examine the reasonableness of the RPD decision to reject the claim and inquire only whether it fell \"within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 47). In particular, to determine whether the RPD had erred in its assessment of the applicant's credibility-by disregarding explanations or documents produced- the RAD would necessarily have to reassess the evidence as a whole and reach its own conclusions as to the merits of the claim."], ["[9]", "Reprising arguments that so far have yet to be accepted by this Court, the respondent reiterates that, on the contrary, Member Bissonnette committed no reviewable error by not reassessing all of the evidence in the record and by applying a standard of review of reasonableness; that a reasonableness standard should be applied to the review of the decision by the RAD. At any rate, the applicant's proposition that the RAD must proceed with an \"independent review of the evidence\" and which is supported by a certain amount of the case law of this Court is not consistent in law and disregards the scheme of the new statutory provisions. The wording of section 110 of the IRPA requires a refugee protection claimant to identify any error of fact, of law or of mixed law and fact, made by the RPD at first instance. There is no mention of having a trial", "de novo", "or of reassessing all of the evidence in the record. Lastly, the respondent adds that even if the standard of review to be applied to the RPD's findings of fact or of mixed fact and law was that of palpable and overriding error, as certain colleagues of this Court assert, the end result should be the same, which would justify the dismissal of this application for judicial review."], ["[10]", "At the hearing, in response to the Court's questions regarding the case law, the applicant's learned counsel argued that if the Court would not decide, the issue of the scope of the appeal before the RAD on a correctness standard, it could at least include, in its reasons for judgment, some clarification with regard to the scope of sections 110 and 111 of the IRPA. The Court's opinion could be of great assistance to the parties and to the panel when the issue comes up again for redetermination, given that the statements in the case law with respect to the applicable standard can be obscure and contradictory at times. In particular, counsel for the applicant questioned the scope of the test proposed by Justice Phelan in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, according to which \"the RAD is required to conduct a hybrid appeal\"; on the one hand, the Court indicates that the RAD \"must review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment\" (at para 54) while on the other, the Court states that the RAD \"can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion\" (at para 55). These statements appear to be contradictory. The applicant's counsel further opined that the automatic application of the palpable and overriding error standard, which is what Justices Shore and Roy appear to favour (", "Alvares", ", <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above) is likely to lead to serious problems of application and create injustices in the future because one cannot compare the RAD to a traditional court of appeal that hears thousands of different cases."], ["[11]", "At first glance, both parties agree that it its current wording the standard of palpable and overriding error set out by the Supreme Court in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [", "HL", "] seems more demanding than the reasonableness standard set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. It should be recalled that in the latter case the Supreme Court decided to meld the two previous standards (reasonableness", "simpliciter", "and patent unreasonableness) into a single standard of review. If a greater degree of deference (patent and overriding error) poses no problem for the respondent, it makes no practical sense for the applicant. The applicant points out that under the new scheme thousands of refugee claimants rejected by the RPD are now denied an opportunity to have a pre-removal risk assessment [PRRA]. And cases that are appealed before the RAD are already restricted to certain countries in which peoples' lives are often at stake. For the applicant, these latter factors make a strong case for the RAD adopting a standard of review for RPD decisions that affords precious little room for deference, and one that is certainly less deferential than the reasonableness standard, no matter which qualifiers are used (reasonableness or palpable and overriding error)."], ["[12]", "For the reasons that follow, this application for judicial review should be allowed.", "Standard of review"], ["[13]", "Let us begin this analysis by determining which standard of review this Court, as a superior court sitting in judicial review of any decision made under the IRPA (sections 3, 18 and 18.1 of the", "Federal Courts Act", ", RSC 1985, c F-7; section 72 of the IRPA), must apply to various determinations of the RAD ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras 27", "et seq.", ").

In contrast, on a correctness standard there can only be one right answer.

To begin with, in this case, no constitutional question has been raised by the parties. In addition, I would doubt that any veritable \"question of jurisdiction\" in its narrow sense is at play here, which is the case \"where the tribunal must explicitly determine whether its statutory grant of power gives it the authority to decide a particular matter\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 59). It should be recalled that the Supreme Court of Canada warned that federal courts \"should not be alert to brand as jurisdictional, and therefore subject to broader curial review, that which may be doubtfully so\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 35, citing", "Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 963 v New Brunswick Liquor Corp.", ", [1979] 2 SCR 227 at p. 233)."], ["[20]", "According to subsections 110(1) and (2) of the IRPA, an appeal before the RAD involves \"a question of law, of fact or mixed law and fact\" raised by the refugee claimant or by the Minister in his or her notice of appeal.

The RAD has the express power to overturn any RPD decision that is \"wrong in law, in fact, or in mixed law and fact\" (paragraph 111(2)(", ") of the IRPA). The scope of the appeal is therefore not in issue. Nor is it a matter of interpreting the scope of the exclusions set out in subsection 110(2) - which restrict the RAD's capacity to hear certain types of appeal. Rather, the issue is to determine whether the member committed a reviewable error in choosing to apply a reasonableness standard when considering questions of fact or of mixed law and fact raised by the applicant in her notice of appeal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above), and did so on the basis of a questionable interpretation or application of the judgment issued by the Alberta Court of Appeal in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  AR 89 [", "Newton", "]."], ["[21]", "Indeed, for Member Bissonnette, only a pure question of law or a breach of natural justice are reviewable on a correctness standard on appeal before the RAD (impugned decision at para 38).

Such is therefore the case where the RAD is interpreting its enabling statute, in this case the IRPA. In practice, deference is largely an incidental issue to the RAD's perception of its appellate role. In the absence of an explicit statutory provision, one might say it is a question of \"judicial or institutional policy\" - for lack of a better description. It must be noted here that neither section 110 nor section 111 of the IRPA make any specific reference to the \"degree of deference\" the RAD may or may not afford to a finding of fact, of law, or of mixed law and fact made by the RPD. In passing, the concept of deference that we associate with \"standards of review\" should not be confused with the particular grounds for appeal or for review of an appealable or reviewable decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paras 14-15). Therefore, if it is not a true question of jurisdiction, does the issue fall under another category to which a correctness standard applies?"], ["[24]", "Up to this point, the Supreme Court has given a very narrow reading of the last exception, that of a question of law of central importance.

At first glance, given the experience of its members and institutional expertise, the RAD is very well placed to determine whether the new statutory provisions create a \"true appeal\", an \"appeal", "de novo", "\", or another type of administrative appeal.

Another limit relevant to this case is that no appeal lies to the RAD from any RPD decision that states that the claim has no credible basis or is considered manifestly unfounded (paragraph 111(2)(c) of the IRPA). As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the threshold for a no credible basis finding is very high because the RPD is required to \"examine all the evidence and to conclude that the claim has no credible basis only when there is no trustworthy or credible evidence that could support a recognition of the claim\" (at para 51). The underpinning for a determination that a claim has no credible basis is therefore a finding on the applicant's credibility made by the RPD. While section 111 of the IRPA provides that these determinations cannot be appealed to the RAD, section 111 does not restrict the right of appeal on other credibility findings made by the RPD."], ["[85]", "Moreover, despite the new restrictions to section 111 set out in Bill C-31, the possibility of access to a fact-based appeal is always mentioned.

For his part, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (above at paras 32-38), Justice Roy also cites numerous excerpts of the same type. In light of the passages cited in his decision, it appears clear that the creation of the RAD had a dual purpose: (1) on the one hand, to enable the RAD to efficiently correct errors made by the RPD by conducting a complete review of questions of fact, law and mixed law and fact and (2) on the other hand, to enable the RAD to ensure consistency in the decision-making process by establishing uniform jurisprudence on refugee law issues. I agree completely with the opinion of my colleague Justice Roy that [translation] \"nothing in 2010 would suggest that appeals would have the appearance of quasi-judicial review\", while [translation] \"[t]he same generous appeal theme was addressed by the Minister when he introduced Bill C-31, which became the", "Protecting Canada's Immigration System Act", ", SC 2012, c 17, for second reading in the House of Commons\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paras 36-37)."], ["[87]", "We paraphrase by saying that the RAD was created to ensure that the RPD makes [translation] \"correct decisions\" and that it applies [translation] \"correct law\" to the facts of the case.

The goal appears to be to discourage appeals on questions of fact or mixed law and fact by introducing a concept of deference directly copied from the judicial model. The RAD's current reasoning fails to take into account the factors that are relevant in the particular context of the Act, one being [translation] \"that the legislative scheme, viewed as a whole, does not at all suggest deference within the meaning of the reasonableness standard\" and the other that [translation] \"[j]udicial review, with its inherent deference, stems from a very different logic than an appeal\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paras 20-21).", "Conclusion"], ["[88]", "I have concluded for the above-noted reasons that Member Bissonnette's reasoning in this case is not an acceptable outcome in law.

We note that section 18.1 of the", "Federal Courts Act", "\"generally sets out threshold grounds which permit but do not require the court to grant relief\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 36).

The RAD is a specialized appeal tribunal, and the Court is not constituted to reassess the evidence. Unlike the RAD, the Court does not sit on appeal from decisions of the RPD. The court is therefore not well positioned to substitute itself for the RAD to assess the merits of the parties' arguments in favour of or against the RPD's decision, and even less, to review the evidence in the tribunal record in light of a standard of deference that the RAD never applied before - even assuming that there should be some deference with respect to questions of fact or mixed law and fact."], ["[90]", "On the other hand, I am not convinced in this case that the result of the applicant's appeal will be the same if the RAD applies a different standard than the one it has applied until now ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).

In the interim, unless the Court or the RAD orders a stay of proceedings, the onus will be on the RAD to review the Act and to adopt a new test based on an analysis that will, this time, take all the relevant factors into account. That being said, I do not believe that the two alternative approaches (the so-called \"palpable and overriding error\" appellate standard of review; a composite and variable standard of review) discussed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, are the only options to consider - the absence of deference in the case of any error of law, fact or law and fact being also a possible option."], ["[92]", "The application for judicial review will therefore be allowed, and the case will be referred back to the RAD for a reconsideration of the applicant's appeal that takes into account the jurisprudence of the Court and these reasons.

It sells the logs harvested from its lands in the B.C. market as well as to buyers in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China. Logs command a higher price in the international markets than in the domestic market. TimberWest and other log producers therefore have a significant financial interest in the export of logs."], ["[6]", "The cost of moving logs over land between B.C. and other provinces is prohibitively expensive due to the mountain ranges in B.C. Logs from B.C. are thus seldom shipped to other provinces. However, the province's access to salt water ports and the lower cost of shipping over water provide for easier access to international markets, particularly, the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Asia. B.C. is the largest provincial exporter of logs by volume and number of shipments. Log exports from B.C. generated $527 million in revenues in 2005. Ontario, the second largest provincial exporter of logs, generated log export revenues of $55 million in 2005."], ["[7]", "That said, only a small percentage of raw logs are actually exported out of Canada. Statistics Canada estimates that in 2003, 6.2% of the logs harvested in B.C. were exported, and 1.2% of the logs harvested in Ontario were exported. (At trial it was pointed out by David Gyton, a consulting forester, that this estimate is not reliable because Statistics Canada relies on data obtained from U.S. Customs. Nevertheless, this is the best available information.) The logs that are not exported are used in the domestic log processing industry. They are processed into wood products such as softwood and hardwood lumber, pulp and paper products, panels, and value added products, for example, moulding and furniture. B.C. is the largest provincial exporter of lumber products. B.C. lumber exports generated $6.4 billion in revenues in 2005, 12 times more than those for B.C. log exports."], ["[8]", "This case concerns export controls for logs, as opposed to wood products.

Log processors support the banning of log exports, since the processing of logs within the province creates employment and adds value to local industry. Environmentalists also support the banning of log exports, arguing that increasing exports results in greater deforestation and unnecessary environmental destruction. By contrast, log producers, which benefit from the higher prices in the international market, are opposed to log export controls."], ["[10]", "The federal government and the B.C. government have co-operated in the field of export controls over B.C. logs, by adopting a restrictive log export policy so as to ensure an adequate supply of logs for log processors in B.C. Generally, logs proposed for export must be offered first to domestic log processors by way of advertisement for sale on a bi-weekly list. If no fair offers are received in response to the advertisement, the logs are considered to be surplus to domestic needs and an export permit is issued by the Minister. Conversely, if fair offers are received, the logs are not considered to be surplus and an export permit is normally refused."], ["[11]", "A consequence of this export scheme is that it pits log producers against log processors in a strategic game in which deals are struck to ensure that proposed log exports are not blocked from export. Log producers are of the view that log processors should always approach log producers directly to purchase logs, rather than submit offers on logs that are advertised on the bi-weekly list. Log producers refer to any offers made on proposed log exports as \"blocking\" offers because they prevent the log exports from reaching their intended customer in the international market. Log processors, however, view the process of making an offer on logs advertised on a bi-weekly list as simply a means to obtain a supply of logs if the log producer is unwilling to supply the logs. TimberWest's strategy to reduce the number of blocking offers is to negotiate with sawmills to give them supplies of logs in exchange for an agreement not to block the log exports. This strategy is also followed by a number of other B.C. log producers, including Darkwoods Forestry, Merrill & Ring, and Island Timberlands."], ["[12]", "TimberWest and other log producers claim that the export scheme in B.C. favours the log processing sector at the expense of the log producing sector. They claim that it has the effect of artificially lowering the price of logs in the domestic market because log producers are ensured an adequate supply of cheap logs. Also, international buyers discount the price they are willing to pay for a parcel of logs given that shipments of logs are not guaranteed, as export of logs may be blocked by an offer from a domestic purchaser."], ["[13]", "The provincial log export restrictions are set out in Part 10 of the", "Forest Act", ", R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 157 (The", "B.C.

The vast majority of TimberWest's private timberlands were originally granted by the Crown before March 12, 1906 and therefore is subject to the federal policy."], ["[17]", "To put the export restrictions in context, it should be noted that in B.C., provincial Crown lands comprise 95% of the land holdings, federal Crown lands comprise 1%, and private lands comprise the remaining 4%. Almost two-thirds of the B.C. softwood log exports in 2005 came from private lands. TimberWest and Island Timberlands together own 75% of the private lands on the B.C. coast."], ["[18]", "The federal export policy came about because the B.C. government had approached the federal government for assistance in managing their forest industry and protecting local jobs and industry by restricting the export of logs from B.C. To formalize the co-operation in the field of export controls over logs, the two governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on March 30, 1998. It is stated in the MOU that its purpose is to \"recognize the importance of export controls in ensuring an adequate supply of logs for domestic manufacture\".

With respect to such logs, the practice stated in Notice 102 is as follows:", "(1) An exporter of logs obtained from private lands in B.C. must first submit to the Export Controls Division (ECD) of the DFAIT an application to advertise the logs for domestic sale. A copy of this application must be sent to the regional office of the B.C. Ministry of Forests (BCMOF) where the logs will be advertised.

(See paragraph 2.2 of Notice 102.)", "(3) If offers are made within the required time period, the offers are forwarded by the ECD/DFAIT and/or the BCMOF to the Federal Timber Export Advisory Committee (FTEAC) (see paragraph 2.4 of Notice 102). The FTEAC considers whether any offers made are fair and makes a recommendation to the ECD/DFAIT, which will then review the FTEAC recommendation and any other relevant factors in determining whether or not an adequate supply of logs exists. The Minister then decides on whether to issue an export permit. In making this decision, the Minister considers whether the logs are surplus. (See paragraph 4.4 of Notice 102.)", "(4) If no offers are received within the required time period, the ECD/DFAIT will consider this and any other factors in determining whether the logs are surplus to domestic requirements. If the logs are determined to be surplus, the exporter is asked to submit an application form for an export permit, and the ECD/DFAIT will undertake to process the application.

There is no mention of needs of a federal nature."], ["[97]", "Although Justice Reed in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) stated, in obiter, that \"other needs\" would be needs of a national or federal character, she appeared to be basing this conclusion on the ejusdem generis rule of construction.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal stated the following at pages 167 to 168:", "\"With respect to the question whether the making of the Order in Council was authorized by paragraph 3(c) of the", "Act", ", the Judge of first instance, in addition to finding that the Governor in Council had possibly acted on the basis of erroneous information, expressed the view that the Governor in Council had possibly misconstrued that paragraph of the statute and, for that reason, failed to form the required belief. Indeed, the Judge expressed the opinion that the words 'other needs' in that paragraph were to be interpreted by applying the 'ejusdem generis' rule as referring only to needs related to defence. As we are not in a state of war, and as red cedar is clearly not necessary for the defence of the country, it would follow, if I understand the Judge's reasons, that the Governor in Council acted on the basis of a wrong interpretation of the statute as well as of misleading information.", "\"I may say immediately that this interpretation of paragraph 3(c) of the", "Act", "appears to me to be wrong. The words 'other needs' in that paragraph clearly mean what they say, namely, needs other than those related to defence. I do not see any reason to restrict the normal meaning of those words in the manner suggested. I am of the opinion, therefore, that it cannot be seriously argued that the Governor in Council, in making the order in council in question, acted on a wrong interpretation of the statute.\""], ["[98]", "The same conclusion was reached by Justice Pitfield in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  BCSC 1709. Justice Pitfield stated at paragraphs 37 and 38:", "\"37. An interpretation of the meaning of the phrase 'defence or other needs' was not required in order to compel reconsideration of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> applications by the Minister. While stating her inclination in relation to the meaning of the phrase, Reed, J., was careful to say she did not have to decide the point. It follows that I am not constrained by the Federal Court of Canada Trial Division decision on the meaning of the phrase. With respect, it is my opinion that the phrase should not be given the narrow meaning proposed by Reed, J.", "\"38. In my opinion, the use of the word 'defence' in conjunction with 'other needs' does not readily permit the application of the ejusdem generis doctrine of construction. The rule of construction was described by LaForest, J., in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.C.), at 203:", "'Whatever the particular document one is construing, when one finds a clause that sets out a list of specific words followed by a general term, it will normally be appropriate to limit the general term to the genus of the narrow enumeration that precedes it.'\"", "Justice Pitfield also stated the following at paragraphs 41 to 50:", "\"41. The word 'defence' stands on its own. It is not a word in a list. It is not described as having a federal or national character although it is of such a character. In my opinion, it is not appropriate to rely on the ejusdem generis doctrine to say that 'other needs' may only be those that possess one attribute of a single word and therefore must mean needs with a national or federal character. The meaning of 'other needs' is not restricted in any manner by its disjunctive juxtaposition with the word 'defence'. Had Parliament intended a need to have a federal or national character, it could easily have said so.", "\"42. Furthermore, nothing in the text of s. 3 suggests that the", "Export Control List", "was created to support matters of federal or national character without reference to provincial need.", "\"43. Section 3(a) is directed to a matter of federal concern namely, arms, ammunition, implements and munitions of war. Paragraph (b) is directed to the promotion of further processing in Canada of a natural resource that is produced in Canada. That phrase embodies provincial needs or purposes.", "\"44. Section 3(c) is directed to the control of the export of raw or processed material produced in Canada in circumstances of surplus supply and depressed prices. There is nothing to suggest that a federal or national, as opposed to provincial, need is paramount in that context.", "\"45. Section 3(c. 1) was directed to the support or enforcement of the", "Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act", ". While that is federal legislation concerned with international trade and commerce, it does not exist for a federal or national purpose but for the purpose of counter-acting alleged shortcomings in provincial policy.", "\"46. Section 3(d) refers to the addition of items to the", "Export Control List", "in order to implement an intergovernmental arrangement or commitment. By their very nature, such arrangements must take into account matters of federal or national character and those of a provincial nature as well.", "\"47. With respect, there is nothing in paragraph 3(e) which should compel the addition of an article to the", "Export Control List", ", or restrict the exercise of discretion, by reference to matters of national or federal, as opposed to provincial, importance.", "\"48. It is in the discretion of the Minister to decide whether or not there is any need to restrict the export of any article in order to ensure adequate supply and distribution of that article in Canada. Provided adequate supply and distribution are the bases of the concern, the cause of the concern, whether provincial, national or federal, is not material. In sum, the restriction of the words 'other needs' to a need of a national or federal character would have the effect of amending the statute.", "\"49. In my opinion, the claim in respect of abuse of public office must fail. Because the words 'other needs' are broad enough to encompass a provincial supply and distribution concern, the Minister did not act unlawfully by taking that need into account. The Minister cannot be said to have acted with targeted malice toward <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , nor can he be said to have been reckless in acting as he did, given the nature of the discretion conferred upon him. An essential element of the tort has not been proved on the balance of probabilities.", "\"50. If a contrary view should prevail with respect to the interpretation of s. 3(e) so that it does not encompass provincial needs, then nothing would have prevented the Minister from resorting to s. 3(b) in the course of exercising his discretion. Provincial need is relevant in that context. That being the case, the Minister cannot be said to have exercised his discretion with malice or in reckless disregard of the nature and extent of his discretion.\""], ["[99]", "I would adopt the reasoning of Justice Pitfield for the present case."], ["[100]", "In conclusion, I am of the opinion that Notice 102 is authorized by the", "EIPA", "Is the Notice 102 regime constitutionally valid under subsection 91(2) of the Constitution", "Act", ", 1867 (trade and commerce) or invalid because it is under subsection 92(13) of the Constitution", "Act", ", 1867 (property and civil rights) or under subsection 92(16) of the Constitution", "Act", ", 1867, (matters of a purely local and private nature)?"], ["[101]", "The defendant submitted that a constitutional argument is not applicable to policy instruments such as Notice 102 and cited the Supreme Court of Canada decision in", "Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium", ", above.

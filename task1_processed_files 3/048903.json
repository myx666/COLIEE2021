A distinction must be noted between an interlocutory order or judgment, on the one hand and an interlocutory application on the other. By rule 336(1)(g), what the Chief Justice or Associate Chief Justice may assign to a prothonotary to hear and dispose of, is an interlocutory application. An interlocutory application is one that arises in the course of an action. That is to say, in the usual case, between the institution of the action and judgment after trial. A final order or judgment is one that finally determines an issue between the parties (the existence of a right of appeal does not affect the finality of the order or judgment)."], ["[8]", "It can be seen that it is possible for an interlocutory application to result in a final judgment or order.

By s. 12(1) of the Federal Court Act, the Governor-in-Council is empowered to appoint prothonotaries. By s. 12(3) of that Act, it is provided that the powers, duties and functions of prothonotaries shall be determined by the Rules. As noted previously, rule 336 provides for certain powers of prothonotaries. I am therefore of the opinion that the Chief Justice or the Associate Chief Justice may give the power to hear and dispose of an application to strike a Statement of Claim under rule 419 to a prothonotary and the Associate Chief Justice has done so."], ["[12]", "I also note that several orders in which applications to strike Statements of Claim have been considered by prothonotaries, have been appealed to judges of the Trial Division of this court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  decided those appeals, it does not appear that the question of jurisdiction was argued.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Rouleau.

I expressed the view from the Bench that a successful motion to strike should be followed after the expiry of the appeal period by a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution, analogizing to the situation which existed when actions were commenced by issuing a writ followed by a Statement of Claim. From the foregoing reasoning, it is apparent that the two stage procedure I suggested from the bench is not necessary. This is so even in a case where a Statement of Claim is struck in its entirety without any provision that the claim is struck without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to file a fresh Statement of Claim."], ["[14]", "At an earlier stage in this action, the defendant moved for a stay on the grounds that Bill C60 was before the House of Commons and would, if passed, remove any right the plaintiff might have in this action. Neither side argued the matter of retroactivity or retrospectivity, nevertheless in my view, which I expressed in written reasons, the legislation if passed, as then worded would not apply to this action. I refused a stay on that ground. My decision was appealed to the Associate Chief Justice who did not disapprove my reasoning but expressed a different reason for refusing a stay. The different reason was the uncertainty of any bill preceding to proclamation [see 18 F.T.R. 264]."], ["[15]", "Counsel for the respondent/plaintiff argued issue estoppel on the grounds I had found that the plaintiffs' alleged rights would not be fatally affected by the passage of the legislation. Counsel for the defendant, correctly in my view, argued that the issue which might have been estopped was the issue of the stay, which was the subject of the motion before me on the former occasion. My reasons, in counsel's view, did not by the doctrine of issue estoppel, apply to the motion now in issue. I have no doubt that counsels' contention was correct. Nevertheless, I had reviewed the possibility of relation back of this legislation. I therefore suggested to counsel for the defendant/applicant that he might wish the motion to be heard by someone else.

I understand that to mean that the act whenever done does not at the moment of proclamation of the section or thereafter constitute an infringement. One cannot construe the wording to mean that such an act whenever done did not at the time it was done constitute an infringement. There are cases decided before the enactment of s. 46.1 in which apparently similar acts have been held to be infringements. It is therefore possible that a trial judge when evidence is presented, would find that at the time the acts complained of were done, they constituted infringements. It therefore is necessary to determine the effect of this legislation on this action so far as it seeks relief for acts done before proclamation. Where as in this case the effect of the legislation is to remove property rights, there is a presumption that the legislation does not apply to actions in progress. This principle was expressed by Sir George Jessel, the Master of the Rolls, in the case of In re Joseph Suche & Co. Limited, 1 Ch. D. 48, where he said at page 50:", "\".... it is a general rule that when the Legislature alters the rights of parties by taking away or conferring any right of action, its enactments, unless in express terms they apply to pending actions, do not affect them. It is said that there is one exception to that rule, namely, that, when enactments merely affect procedure and do not extend to rights of action, they have been held to apply to existing rights ...\""], ["[20]", "However, the reasons for judgment of Sir George Jessel still the Master of the Rolls in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  legislation should apply to actions in progress when the legislation came into force.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  statute repealed an earlier statute, 22 & 23 Vict., c. 35, in which relief from forfeiture was provided and enacted new legislation containing different provisions for relief from forfeiture. The Master of the Rolls pointed out, that were the new provisions for relief from forfeiture not to apply to prior breaches, the legislation, intended to allow greater scope for the power to relieve from forfeiture, would result in a tenant being denied a right to relief which he had previously had, as well as the somewhat different right to relief which the new legislation was intended to provide. The Master of the Rolls therefore concluded that to further the intention of the new legislation, it must be held to apply to pending proceedings.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  legislation were not applied to pending litigation, it would have the opposite effect to that intended. Interpreting the Copyright Act amendments not to apply to pending litigation does not result in the removal of pre-existing rights which it was intended the plaintiff should continue to have."], ["[21]", "I have reviewed the cases and texts cited by counsel at the hearing and those cited in my Reasons of November 3rd, 1987, and find none which would impair the applicability of the rule expressed in In re Suche. There is no need for me to comment on the submissions of plaintiff's counsel with respect to the Canadian Bill of Rights 8 and 9 Elizabeth 2, c. 44 and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Constitution Act, 1982."], ["[22]", "It remains to be considered whether a cause of action existed before the 1988 legislation came into force. The fact situation here may not be dissimilar to that in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R. (3d) 289 (F.C.A.), in that the protection of the Copyright Act is claimed for something which may overlap the protection available under the Industrial Design Act."], ["[23]", "The fact situation may also be one in which the protection available under the Copyright Act overlaps the protection available under the Patent Act. It may be that the fact situation is such that no part of the work for which copyright protection is claimed is not either within the protection available under the Industrial Design Act or the Patent Act and that therefore, pursuant to the reasoning  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Boats and the English case,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Copyright Act provides no protection. It may be that there is a gap in which the Copyright Act can be applicable. It was argued that there could in theory be no such gap and that therefore factual evidence was not necessary for me to determine that there was no cause of action. That is to say, that to a drawing of an object that is useful there are only two aspects, the design aspect and the functional aspect. These aspects would at some time in history have been registerable as industrial designs or been patentable had legislation for that purpose been in existence. This, of course, is to deny to a painting of a sail boat any protection in copyright. I am not prepared to find that there can be no such gap in theory. There was no evidence before me on which I could find there is not in fact a gap.

Academic commentators and practitioners have raised some serious questions as to whether the conceptual basis for each of the existing standards has been delineated with sufficient clarity by this Court, with much of the criticism directed at what has been described as 'epistemological' confusion over the relationship between patent unreasonableness and reasonableness simpliciter ... Reviewing courts too, have occasionally expressed frustration over a perceived lack of clarity in this area, as the comments of Barry, J., in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  illustrate:", "'In attempting to follow the court's distinctions between \"patently unreasonable\", \"reasonable\" and \"correct\", one feels at times as though one is watching a juggler juggle three transparent objects. Depending on the way the light falls, sometimes one thinks one can see the objects. Other times one cannot and, indeed, wonders whether there are really three distinct objects there at all.'", "\"The Court cannot remain unresponsive to sustained concerns or criticism coming from the legal community in relation to the state of Canadian jurisprudence in this important part of the law. ...

Because patent unreasonableness, as a posture of curial deference, was conceived in opposition only to a correctness standard of review, it was sufficient for the Court to emphasize in defining its scope the principle that there will often be no one interpretation that can be said to be correct in interpreting a statute or otherwise resolving a legal dispute, and that specialized administrative adjudicators may, in many circumstances, be better equipped than courts to choose between the possible interpretations. Where this is the case, provided that the adjudicator's decision is one that can be 'rationally supported on a construction which the relevant legislation may reasonable be considered to bear', the reviewing court should not intervene.", "\"Upon the advent of reasonableness simpliciter, however, the validity of multiple interpretations became the underlying premise for this new variant of reasonableness review as well.

In the case of reasonableness simpliciter, 'a decision may satisfy the ... standard if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing courts find compelling' (", "Ryan", ", supra, at para. 55). There seems to me to be no qualitative basis on which to differentiate effectively between these various characterizations of a rationality analysis; how, for instance, would a decision that is not 'tenably supported' (and is thus 'merely' unreasonable ) differ from a decision that is not 'rationally supported' (and is thus patently unreasonable)?", "In the end, the essential question remains the same under both standards: was the decision of the adjudicator taken in accordance with reason? Where the answer is no, for instance because the legislation in question cannot rationally support the adjudicator's interpretation, the error will invalidate the decision, regardless of whether the standard applied is reasonableness simpliciter or patent unreasonableness ... Because the two variants of reasonableness are united at their theoretical source, the imperative for the reviewing court to intervene will turn on the conclusion that the adjudicator's decision deviates from what falls within the ambit of reasonable, not on 'fine distinctions' between the test for patent unreasonableness and reasonableness simpliciter ...", "The existence of these two variants of reasonableness review forces reviewing courts to continue to grapple with the significant practical problems inherent in distinguishing meaningfully between the two standards. To the extent that a distinction is advanced on the basis of the relative severity of the defect, this poses not only practical difficulties but also difficulties in principle, as this approach implies that patent unreasonableness, in requiring 'clear' rather than 'mere' irrationality, allows for a margin of appreciation for decisions that are not in accordance with reasons. In this respect, I would echo Mullan's comments that there would 'have to be concerns with a regime of judicial review which would allow any irrational decision to escape rebuke even under the most deferential standard of scrutiny' (Mullan,", "Recent Development in Standard of Review", ", supra, at p. 25)", "\" (emphasis added)"], ["[13]", "In any event, whatever standard of review I apply in this case, be it patent unreasonableness or reasonableness simpliciter, I am satisfied that there is nothing about the impugned decision of the Minister to issue the water permit to the Chateau Lake Louise Corporation which would warrant this Court's interference."], ["[14]", "The applicant maintains that the water permit impairs the park's ecological integrity through the Chateau's withdrawal of huge amounts of water on an annual basis and through the introduction of ecological stresses such as the drying up of the upper reaches of Louise Creek, the reduction of natural stream flows in Louise Creek, the introduction of increased amounts of treated sewage into the Bow River and the alteration of the aquatic invertebrate community.

It is submitted that the 525,653 cubic metres of water which the permit allows and the use of the average annual water withdrawal from the period of 1995 to 1998 to arrive at that figure, is unreasonable and is not in accordance with subsection 8(2) of the", "Canada National Parks Act", "which provides that \"the maintenance or restoration of ecological integrity, through the protection of natural resources and natural processes, shall be the first priority of the Minister when considering all aspects of the management of parks\"."], ["[15]", "However, the vast majority of the applicant's submissions are simply an attack on the evidence that was before the decision-maker and the correctness of the conclusions drawn from that evidence.

No information about the probable future effects of a project can ever be complete or exclude all possible future outcomes. The appreciation of the adequacy of such evidence is a matter properly left to the judgment of the panel which may be expected to have, as this one in fact did, a high degree of expertise in environmental matters. In addition, the principal criterion set by the statute is the 'significance' of the environmental effects of the project: that is not a fixed or wholly objective standard and contains a large measure of opinion and judgment. Reasonable people can and do disagree about the adequacy and completeness of evidence which forecasts future results and about the significance of such results without thereby raising questions of law.\""], ["[16]", "The Court of Appeal has made it clear that in cases of this nature, a reviewing court should decline to allow itself to become an academy of science called upon to weigh conflicting statements about the maintenance or restoration of ecological integrity so as to determine which statement is correct.

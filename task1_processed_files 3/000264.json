In addition, he has a post-doctorate degree in physics from the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi. He has also attained a doctorate degree from the University of Bris in France. In 1981, Dr. Grover accepted a position with the National Research Council (\"NRC\") as an Associate Research Professor in the field of optics. Dr. Grover's optics research has earned him an international reputation as a highly respected scientist."], ["[3]", "In September 1987, Dr. Grover filed a complaint with the Tribunal which alleged that from September 1986 to August 1987 his employer, the NRC, had engaged in discriminatory practices against him contrary to s. 7 of the", "Canadian Human Rights Act", ", R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the \"", "Act", "\") on the grounds of his race, colour and national origin. Dr. Grover claimed that the actions of two NRC directors denied him managerial and promotional opportunities as well as research responsibilities. A further amended complaint was filed in August 1989 alleging further incidents of discrimination. A second amended complaint was filed during the course of the inquiry. On August 21, 1992, after hearing 26 days of evidence and testimony, the Tribunal found that Dr. Grover's complaint of racial discrimination against the NRC was substantiated and a remedial order was issued. The NRC was ordered to given Dr. Grover a written apology, to cease and desist its discriminatory practices, to pay damages for hurt feelings, to compensate Dr. Grover for denied salary progression and to appoint him to an appropriate position.

It is argued that this breach vitiates the entire proceedings. Third, even if the Tribunal is found not to be \"functus officio\", it is argued that the March 18, 1994 decision that Dr. Grover was appointed to an inappropriate position is void as it is based on an error of law and/or fact.", "(a) Was The Tribunal \"Functus Officio\"?"], ["[14]", "The applicant takes the position that the Tribunal, after hearing 26 days of evidence, spoke its final mind regarding the issue of an appropriate appointment for Dr. Grover, an issue which was central to the proceedings, and set out all the indicia of such a position in its August 21, 1992, decision at pages 13-14:", "\"There is little doubt that Dr. Grover aspired to a position of management with the Division of Physics, and specifically that of a Section Head. The responsibilities of a section head within the Division of Physics would have called for added responsibility including the evaluation of the performance of staff, allocation of funds including travel funds, involvement with research planning and promotions. It should be noted that prior to Dr. Grover's return from NOI, he had been acting in the capacity of assistant director and acting scientific director, and in the mission statement of NOI was slated for a section head position along with other of the transferred members from the Division of Physics, namely Dr. Cowan and Dr. Powell. The initial promotion assessments from 1981 through to 1984, coupled with the evidence of Dr. Major and Dr. Cowan, clearly lead this tribunal Board to conclude that Dr. Grover was qualified to assume the position of Section Head and was quite capable of fulfilling the responsibilities relating to such a position.\""], ["[15]", "The applicant argues that there is no express provision in the", "Act", "which allows the Tribunal to revisit its final decisions.

The applicant also relies upon the proposition that settlement discussions are generally privileged from disclosure during the trial of an action.

In the alternative, if the consent is found to be relevant, the applicant points to the record, and particularly to the correspondence between counsel for the NRC and the Tribunal, which indicates that the NRC consistently maintained its objection to the Tribunal taking jurisdiction over the issue of the appointment. Therefore, a finding that the parties consented to its jurisdiction is a finding contrary to the material before the Tribunal.

At the opening of the inquiry, it is argued that the Chairman, Mr. Fleck, testified as to his version of the events which had occurred in the interim period between the two hearings and that the Tribunal made a finding of fact on the basis of this testimony that Mr. Saunders had given his undertaking not to raise the question of \"functus officio\".

I requested as Chairman, that all parties represented by counsel submit a brief of the issues, as defined. They did that. We agreed that we would meet informally to ascertain how we could best resolve the outstanding issues. We had a meeting in November, I believe the 27th, at the Human Rights Building, where we are seated today, and at that time it appeared that the question of costs was outstanding. That was a part of our judgment. We resolved the issue on that date, on the consent of all parties. The question of the years of relevant experience, the Y.R.E., and the appointment of an arbitrator to facilitate that calculation, which was a part of our judgment, was outstanding on that day. We again, on consent of all counsel, facilitated a resolution. I arranged to have an arbitrator available for the parties. I am uncertain at this date how that aspect of things has gone, but at least, the facilitating of an arbitrator to deal with that part of the judgment was arranged on consent of all parties and at their encouragement, which left one and the only remaining issue, as I ascertain it from our meetings: the question of an appropriate promotion and the placing of Dr. Grover within the work environment of the National Research Council. It is that issue that, after our November 27th meeting, remained outstanding and we again agreed with the consent of all counsel and their principals, to continue to meet to see if we could resolve that issue, informally, without the necessity of the expense of calling of witnesses and the involvement of further lengthy hearings.

If the respondent -- and I don't mean this as any form of admonishment, warning or otherwise -- but, if the respondent wishes to take the position today, at these formal hearings, with a record being taken, that there is a position of this Board, as such, which may be described legally as 'functus', then so be it.

I don't know what further we could do. We have had some five or six meetings informally, again on consent of all parties, without a record being taken, to try to take the adversarial aspect out of the matter, to see if the hearings could be done informally so that we could resolve this as good-thinking human beings, with an effort to getting both parties on with life, in general; the complainant back to work productively and the respondent with their other concerns.

The applicant takes the position that the September 10, 1992 appointment complied fully with the Order of the Tribunal.

Justice may require the reopening of administrative proceedings in order to provide relief which would otherwise be available on appeal.", "\"Accordingly, the principle should not be strictly applied where there are indications in the enabling legislation that a decision can be reopened in order to enable the tribunal to discharge the function committed to it by enabling legislation.\""], ["[31]", "While there is no express provision in the", "Act", "which allows for reopening of an inquiry, s. 53(2) of the", "Act", "gives wide remedial powers to the Tribunal. The portion of the Tribunal's order at issue in this application was made pursuant to s. 53(2)(b) which reads as follows:", "\"53(2) If, at the conclusion of its inquiry, a Tribunal finds that the complaint to which the inquiry relates is substantiated, it may, subject to subsection (4) and section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in that order any of the following terms that it considers appropriate:", "(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion such rights, opportunities or privileges as, in the opinion of the Tribunal, are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\"", "The Supreme Court of Canada has mandated that Human Rights legislation should be liberally interpreted in a manner which accords full recognition and effect to the rights protected by such legislation:", "Action Travail des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 193, at p. 1134  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 89-90 S.C.R. The words of La Forest, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> are particularly helpful in underscoring the importance of the rights protected by the", "Act", ". He states at pp. 89-90 S.C.R.:", "\"The purpose of the", "Act", "is set forth in s. 2 as being to extend the laws of Canada to give effect to the principle that every individual should have an equal opportunity with other individuals to live his or her own life without being hindered by discriminatory practices based on certain prohibited grounds of discrimination, including discrimination based on sex. As McIntyre, J., speaking for this court, recently explained in", "Ontario Human Rights Commission and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the", "Act", "must be interpreted so as to advance the broad policy considerations underlying it. That task should not be approached in a niggardly fashion but in a manner befitting the special nature of the legislation, which is described as 'not quote constitutional'; see also", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Lamer, J., at pp. 157-158. By this expression, it is not suggested, of course, that the", "Act", "is somehow entrenched but rather that it incorporates certain basic goals of our society. More recently still, Dickson, C.J., in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , emphasized that the rights enunciated in the", "Act", "must be given full recognition and effect consistent with the dictates of the", "Interpretation Act", "that statutes must be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of their objects.\""], ["[32]", "The aim of the", "Act", "is remedial and it is not intended to punish those responsible for the discriminatory treatment. Rather, the primary focus of the legislation is the eradication of discriminatory practices. In light of this, s. 53(2) should be interpreted in a manner which best facilitates the compensation of those subject to discrimination. The redress of discrimination, however, is not always fully achievable simply by the payment of monetary awards. This is reflected by the wide variety of remedial options open to a Tribunal in s. 53(2), of which compensation for monetary losses is only one. The integration into the workplace of an employee who has been subjected to discrimination at the hands of his or her employer to a position which he or she would have occupied had the discriminatory practice not taken place is a remedy which is inherently difficult to implement and therefore, may require some supervision. The implementation of the remedy in this case is further complicated by the long-standing nature of the complaint, the ongoing changes in the management structure of the NRC and the highly complex work of Dr. Grover. Often it may be more desirable for the Tribunal to provide guidelines in order to allow the parties to work out between themselves the details of the reintegration into the workplace, rather than to have an unworkable order forced upon them by the Tribunal."], ["[33]", "It is clear that the", "Act", "compels the award of effective remedies and therefore, in certain circumstances the Tribunal must be given the ability to ensure that their remedial orders are effectively implemented. Therefore, the remedial powers in s. 53(2) should be interpreted as including the power to reserve jurisdiction on certain matters in order to ensure that the remedies ordered by the Tribunal are forthcoming to complainants. The denial of such a power would be overly formalistic and would defeat the remedial purpose of the legislation. In the context of a rather complex remedial order, it makes sense for the Tribunal to remained seized of jurisdiction with respect to remedial issues in order to facilitate the implementation of the remedy. This is consistent with the overall purpose of the legislation and with the flexible approach advocated by Sopinka, J., in", "Chandler", ", supra. It would frustrate the mandate of the legislation to require the complainant to seek the enforcement of an unambiguous order in the Federal Court or to file a new complaint in order to obtain the full remedy awarded by the Tribunal."], ["[34]", "The Federal Court of Appeal has recently held in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that an adjudicator under the", "Canada Labour Code", "has the power to retain jurisdiction regarding remedial issues. MacGuigan, J.A., writing for the court held at p. 157 N.R. that the only test for applying the principle of \"functus officio\" is \"whether the Adjudicator could be said to have finally determined the complaint before him\". Having found that the", "Act", "contemplates the reopening of a decision, in my view, the test in", "Murphy", "is consistent with the criteria laid down in", "Chandler", ", supra and is the proper test to determine whether the Tribunal was \"functus\" with respect to the issue of the appointment when it reopened the hearing on July 6, 1993."], ["[35]", "In my view, it is clear that the Tribunal did not finally dispose of the appointment issue as they explicitly anticipated that the NRC might resist the implementation of the Order and specifically retained jurisdiction in this regard. The reasons of March 18, 1994 indicate that the Tribunal was aware at the time they issued the August 21, 1992 Order that the NRC was undergoing organizational changes which could possibly impact on the appointment of Dr. Grover. The Tribunal states at page 2:", "\"It is vital for an understanding of this matter to appreciate that the substantial portion of the first hearing related to the discriminatory treatment of the Complainant, particularly in the area of peer promotion to the upper management level of N.R.C. As set out on p. 86 of a decision of August 21st, 1992, this Tribunal was fully aware that the respondent N.R.C. was undergoing a substantial restructuring including promotional policy. The Tribunal accordingly retained jurisdiction to hear further evidence to assist with the implementation in the event that difficulties arose with this aspect of the decision.\""], ["[36]", "Given that Dr. Grover is a highly qualified scientist engaged in highly technical research, the August 21, 1992 order regarding the appointment is conspicuously lacking in detail. This suggests that the Tribunal intended that the particulars of the position would be worked out by the parties who, in light of the organizational changes taking place at the NRC, would be best equipped to specify the exact position and responsibilities which would be commensurate with Dr. Grover's expertise."], ["[37]", "I am not persuaded that the Tribunal came to a final decision on August 21, 1992 and then changed its mind in the face of new circumstances when rendering its second decision on March 18, 1994. In the August 21, 1992 decision, the Tribunal found at p. 10 that in 1986 Dr. Grover was \"an outstanding scientist with high peer recognition internationally who was conducting on behalf of the NRC important work in several fields of optics\". Further, at pp. 13 and 14, it was concluded that a position of group leader or section head in the Division of Physics would have been a reasonable career expectation for Dr. Grover in 1986. The Tribunal went on to find that Dr. Grover had been restricted in his research activities by the systematic denial of budget and resources for his work and by his assignment to insignificant roles in projects which were under the control of other scientists. All of these findings provide the basis for the three essential components of an appropriate position which the Tribunal included in their decision dated March 18, 1994 which simply supplement and clarify the original order."], ["[38]", "Given that the Tribunal did not finally dispose of the matters in issue, the continued objections of the NRC to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to deal with the appointment after the August 21, 1992 order also are of little consequence in coming to the conclusion that the Tribunal was not \"functus officio\". It is not the consent of the parties which confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal. While the Tribunal comments on the actions of the NRC in dealing with their objections and states that all counsel involved agreed not to raise the issue of \"functus\" and may have erred in so doing, this is not the basis for their conclusion that they had validly retained jurisdiction. Erroneous findings of fact must be the basis for the impugned decision in order to be considered a sufficient basis to set aside the decision;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). An examination of the record reveals that the Tribunal thoroughly canvassed the law regarding the application of \"functus officio\" and concluded that the principle did not apply primarily on the basis of this legal analysis. The alleged undertaking by counsel for the NRC was only one factor in dealing with this issue."], ["[39]", "I do not see the participation of the Tribunal as a conciliator in the interim period between August 21, 1992 and July 6, 1993 as supporting the view that the Tribunal was \"functus\" upon rendering the August 21, 1992 order. The events during this period are of no relevance to the question of \"functus officio\" as once it is determined that the enabling legislation contemplates the power to retain jurisdiction, the only test to be applied is that articulated by MacGuigan, J.A., in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Tribunal's participation in private settlement negotiations upon their ability to return to a quasi-judicial capacity deserves consideration."], ["[40]", "The Tribunal met privately with both parties in an effort to bring a resolution to the outstanding appointment issue. While such a procedure would be highly unorthodox and would likely invalidate a judicial proceeding before this court, it is inappropriate to apply the same standard to proceedings before the Tribunal under the", "Act", ". The nature of a Human Rights Tribunal is that of a quasi-judicial body charged with the difficult statutory task of resolving often complex and emotional disputes between parties in a manner which emphasizes the compensation of victims of discrimination. Such a task demands innovation and flexibility on the part of the Tribunal in fashioning effective remedies and the", "Act", "is structured so as to encourage this flexibility. That the Tribunal is subject to a less rigorous standard of procedure is illustrated by the less formal rules of evidence applicable to hearings before the Tribunal as mandated in s. 50(2)(c) of the", "Act"], ["[41]", "While the procedure chosen by the Tribunal is certainly unusual and could in some cases be susceptible to legitimate charges of bias, I am not satisfied that the Tribunal's efforts at conciliation in this case justify quashing the decision of the Tribunal. Each party met with the Tribunal and each party had every opportunity to refuse to proceed in this manner. However, no objection was voiced by either party at that time. After the NRC's preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on July 7, 1993 was dismissed, the Tribunal heard five more days of evidence regarding the suitability of the September 10, 1992 appointment to Dr. Grover's area and level of expertise and the management structure of the NRC. Both parties called witnesses and were given every opportunity to present their positions. Therefore, looking at the matter practically, I am not persuaded that the fairness of the proceedings were unduly compromised by the participation of the Tribunal as a conciliator. Some flexibility must be granted to the Tribunal as they have a difficult statutory mandate to fulfil. They should not be held to the same strict procedural standards as a court of law where to do so would result in a grave injustice."], ["[42]", "Likewise, I am not persuaded that the Tribunal committed a breach of natural justice as contended by the applicant in offering an explanation of the events between August 21, 1992 and the reopening of the hearing on July 6, 1993. The applicant seems to take issue with the comments of the Chairman that an undertaking not to challenge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal was given by counsel for the NRC. He refers to these comments as testimony as to converted facts. As stated above, the alleged undertaking was only one minor factor in the Tribunal's conclusion that it was not \"functus officio\". While, the Tribunal may not have been pleased that questions regarding its jurisdiction were being raised, counsel for the NRC was given every opportunity to present its position on this issue. After hearing the parties, the Tribunal set out in great detail an analysis of the law regarding \"functus\" and in my opinion, committed no error of law in concluding that the principle had no application. Therefore, any inaccuracy as to the undertaking is not a sufficient basis to quash the decision."], ["[43]", "As to the comments of the Chairman regarding the conduct of counsel for the NRC, it is understandable that after having heard over 28 days of evidence and making an order which had not been implemented, the Tribunal would be feeling some frustration at the failure of the parties to resolve the outstanding matters. The objection of the NRC to the Tribunal's jurisdiction was simply one further obstacle to the completion of their remedial mandate. Regard should be had to the test for bias set out by Grandpré, J., in", "Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 9 N.R. 115. Would a reasonable and informed person viewing the matter practically and realistically conclude that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Tribunal? I cannot conclude that the Chairman's comments were such to interfere with a full and fair examination of the legal question of \"functus officio\". In my view, the comments did not result in the denial of the applicant's right to a fair hearing."], ["[44]", "The applicant also attacked the March 18, 1994 decision on its merits. Even if the Tribunal did not speak its final mind and validly retained jurisdiction, it was argued that this decision was made without jurisdiction as the NRC complied with the order by appointing Dr. Grover to an appropriate position on September 10, 1992. To accept that this appointment on its face complies with the order without an examination of the quality of the position and its suitability to Dr. Grover, requires an overly narrow reading of the Tribunal's reasons and would divest the order of any meaningful remedial value. In my opinion, the appointment of Dr. Grover to an inappropriate position constitutes a resistance to the implementation of the remedial order and the Tribunal validly reconvened to hear further evidence. Given the problems encountered in the implementation of Dr. Grover's appointment, the Tribunal validly exercised its power in again reserving jurisdiction in the event that further clarification was required after March 18, 1994."], ["[45]", "For all the above reasons, the applications are dismissed.", "Applications dismissed.", "Editor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/sms", "[End of document]"]]}

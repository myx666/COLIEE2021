He has provided me with no evidence as to the costs or other factors involved in such a move. The only evidence he provided in his affidavit was as to the difficulties of him moving to the reserve. I have concluded, however, on the evidence I have, that the last kind of discriminatory characteristic mentioned above is involved here, namely that the Band has no legitimate interest in expecting the Applicant to change his residence from Vancouver to someplace in the CTST.

In its consideration of historical disadvantage, stereotyping, etc. of off-reserve aboriginals generally across Canada, a matter on which there had been no evidence (apart from the circumstances of the Batchewana Band) before the trial or lower Appeal Court, it found there to be generally such stereotyping and historical disadvantage.

One must apply by analogy the historical disadvantage found by the Supreme Court to have been suffered by off-reserve members generally throughout Canada. In this context the group of members living outside the CTST must be regarded as a subset of the traditional category of off-reserve members.

As was found  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ", an off-reserve member has a real and legitimate interest in participating in the governance of his band and it is irrelevant for most purposes that he does not reside on the reserve or in a specifically designated traditional territory of his people.

It helps him maintain a connection with his people and gives him a voice in many matters directly affecting him.

The written submissions quoted above do not, in my view, define any important objective.

Similarly, no rational connection is shown between the right to vote and the obligation to live somewhere in the CTST. To the extent that there might be some logic, in respect to purely local matters, to require that voters be resident on the reserve, this regulation does not require that. It only requires that the voter live in any one of dozens of communities, or in rural areas, scattered throughout the CTST.

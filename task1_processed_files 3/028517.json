The same day, counsel for the Applicant wrote to the Embassy stating that in its view she would be awarded 64 points out of the required 67 (she was actually awarded 62 points) and asked that favourable discretion be exercised in her favour. This is known as a \"substituted evaluation\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[2]", "In her request, the Applicant asked that the following points be considered:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- she had been a visitor to Canada since March of 2003 and was in Canada when the application was filed,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- she studied English in Mexico and received high marks,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- she used her English skills to locate temporary housing,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- she sought out prospective employers and obtained an offer of employment that would take effect once she obtained permanent residence status and returned to Canada,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "- she is conversant in both French and English.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "The application was turned down as she only reached 62 of the required 67 points. The Designated Immigration Officer (the \"Officer\") considered the letter of Applicants counsel but declined to exercise her discretion. The Applicant now seeks judicial review of refusal to exercise her discretion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "It is well established the standard of review is patent unreasonableness. As Mackay, J. stated in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  para. 8:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "In my view the standard of review of a discretionary decision of a visa officer in assessing experience of an intended immigrant in relation to a particular occupation is well settled. In accord with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a court will not intervene in regard to the exercise of discretion vested by statute merely because the court might have exercised the discretion differently if it had been charged with the responsibility. Where it has been exercised in good faith, without reliance on irrelevant or extraneous considerations the courts should not interfere. ...Where the decision in question is one of fact this Court will intervene only if it concludes the decision is patently unreasonable or in other words, as provided in s-s. 18.1(4)(d) of the", "Federal Court Act", ", R.S.C. 1985, c.

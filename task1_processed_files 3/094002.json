In my view, Molson's applied for mark \"Molson Club Ale & Design\" is simply an updated version of its earlier registered trademark \"Club Ale & Design\", which reflects the change in ownership of the brewery from Formosa to Molson. The earlier mark, \"Club Ale & Design\", incorporated the name Formosa, whereas the applied for mark replaces this with the name Molson. In addition, there are stylistic differences between the two marks."], ["[20]", "In my view, Molson being precluded from registering an updated version of its registered trademark \"Club Ale & Design\", by Labatt's applied for mark, \"Manitoba's Club & Design\", is somewhat anomalous. The reason being that Molson opposed Labatt's application for \"Manitoba's Club & Design\", on the basis it was confusing with Molson's trademark \"Club Ale & Design\". Furthermore, Labatt's application never matured to registration and was abandoned nearly ten years ago. The Registrar was sympathetic to the plight of Molson, however he felt constrained by the wording of s. 16(3)(b) of the", "Act", ". This provision reads as follows:", "\"16(3) Any applicant who has filed an application in accordance with s. 30 for registration of a proposed trademark that is registrable is entitled, subject to ss. 38 and 40, to secure its registration in respect of the wares or services specified in the application,", "unless at the date of filing of the application it was confusing with", ". . . . .", "(b)", "a trademark in respect of which an application for registration had been previously filed in Canada by any other person;", "or\" (emphasis added)"], ["[21]", "Thus, pursuant to s. 16(3)(b), the date Molson filed its application (November 17, 1975) is the material date to determine its confusion with trademarks for which applications for registration have been filed. On November 17, 1975, Labatt's application for the trademark \"Manitoba's Club & Design\" was pending, as it had been filed on December 15, 1971 and was not abandoned until November 30, 1987. Accordingly, the Registrar made a determination as to the likelihood of confusion between the two trademarks, even though by the time he made his decision in January of 1995, Labatt's application had been long since abandoned."], ["[22]", "Labatt's application for the mark had been opposed by Molson, on the basis it was confusing with Molson's registered trademark \"Club Ale & Design\". The validity of this ground of opposition was never determined, as Labatt withdrew its application. However, to illustrate the anomaly created by s. 16(3) above, I shall assume for a moment that Molson's opposition was successful, and that Labatt had been unable to register \"Manitoba's Club & Design\", due to confusion with Molson's mark. Even if this had been the outcome of Labatt's application, in my view the Registrar in this case would not have decided any differently, as he only had regard to the date of Molson's application, being November 17, 1975. Thus, Molson's updated trademark \"Molson Club Ale & Design\" could conceivably have been precluded from registration due to confusion with an applied for mark, \"Manitoba's Club & Design\", which never matured to registration due to its confusion with Molson's previously registered trademark."], ["[23]", "I have only discussed this scenario, which in fact never materialized, to illustrate the absurdity of a result which could be reached pursuant to s. 16(3) of the", "Act", ".

Both marks are dominated by the word \"Club\" and a stylized representation of a clover leaf. The non-distinctive word 'Ale' in the applicant's mark does nothing to distinguish it from the opponent's registered mark. In fact, it would seem likely that both marks could be phonetically referred to as 'Club' thereby increasing the likelihood of confusion.\" (Registrar's Decision, January 31, 1995 at p. 4.)"], ["[27]", "In my view, the fact that Molson owns the trademark \"Club\" only adds to the irony of this decision. However, I am also of the view, that this fact does not make the two marks any less confusing. It is not a surrounding circumstance that is relevant to the issue of confusion. It makes no difference, in terms of assessing the confusion between these two trademarks, who owns the trademark \"Club\".

The difficulty encountered by Molson with respect to this submission, is that Molson is asking the court to consider a surrounding circumstance that arose following the material date set out in s. 16(3), being the date of the application. In my view, the circumstance of Labatt having abandoned its trademark application, although it arose after the material date, is intrinsically connected to a circumstance which existed at the material date. In view of this inherent connection and the anomalous circumstances of this case, I find this is an appropriate case to take into consideration the fact that Labatt's application for registration of \"Manitoba's Club & Design\" was abandoned.

On April 7, 2002, the applicant married his wife Ms. Priscila P. Pascual, who is a Canadian citizen."], ["[3]", "In 2003, and subsequently in July 2004, the applicant applied for permanent residence in Canada based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds (H & C), with his wife acting as sponsor."], ["[4]", "Despite his marriage and applications for permanent residence, the applicant had yet to obtain an extension of his original six-month visitor status, resulting in a section 44 report being written in March 2004, which determined that the applicant was inadmissible because he had remained in Canada beyond the period authorized by his visitor's visa contrary to subsection 29(2) of the Act."], ["[5]", "In a letter dated May 11, 2004, the applicant was required to attend at a proceeding on May 26, 2004, to confirm the facts in the section 44 report. The applicant failed to attend at this interview."], ["[6]", "In a further letter dated January 27, 2005, the applicant was again requested to attend at a proceeding pursuant to the same section 44 report. The applicant attended before Immigration Officer Moira McCulloch and was represented at the proceeding by his counsel, Mr. Daniel Kwong."], ["[7]", "Upon completing the interview, Ms. McCulloch confirmed that the information contained in the section 44 report was accurate and thus issued an exclusion order pursuant to Regulation 228 of the Act.", "ISSUE"], ["[8]", "Did the immigration officer breach the applicant's right to procedural fairness leading up to and during the proceeding?", "ANALYSIS"], ["[9]", "The applicant claims that he did not receive proper notice regarding the nature and consequences of the proceedings under subsection 44(2) of the Act, and that this corresponds to a breach of procedural fairness on the part of the immigration officer."], ["[10]", "In reply to this accusation, the respondent states that on two occasions, May 11, 2004 and January 27, 2005, packages were mailed to the applicant containing a notice to appear which listed the contents and purpose of the proceeding under subsection 44(2) of the Act. Further, as previously mentioned, the applicant was represented by counsel at the proceeding. I therefore conclude that the applicant received proper notice of the nature and consequences of the proceeding."], ["[11]", "The applicant also claims that the failure on the part of the immigration officer to provide him with notice of the right to a qualified interpreter during the proceeding was a breach of procedural fairness. I agree with the respondent's submissions that there does not exist a positive obligation on the immigration officer to inform the applicant of his right to an interpreter in the present matter, particularly when taking into consideration that the immigration officer illustrated that the applicant comprehended the proceedings. In support of this position, the respondent mentions the findings of Justice Blanchard in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] F.C.J. No. 870 at paragraph 19:", "As to the argument that the senior immigration officer had a duty to inform the plaintiff of his right to an interpreter and the possible consequences of the interview before the latter began, I have concluded after thinking about the matter that the plaintiffs simply cannot advance such arguments. A review of the notes taken by the immigration officer on May 9, 2000 indicates that the plaintiffs fully understood all the events and did not show any sign that they did not understand."], ["[12]", "In the immigration officer's affidavit, it is clearly noted that the applicant understood the questions being asked and gave coherent answers. Further, the applicant did not request an interpreter, had previously requested that immigration proceedings be held in English and was represented by counsel at the proceeding who did not raise any issue regarding the need for interpretation. The evidence illustrates that the applicant comprehended the proceeding and as such no breach of procedural fairness occurred for the failure on the part of the immigration officer to mention the right to an interpreter."], ["[13]", "The applicant claims that the immigration officer fettered her discretion by issuing an exclusion order rather than referring the case to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) for an admissibility hearing. I find however, that pursuant to Regulation 228, the officer was not authorized to refer the case to an admissibility hearing of the IAD, but rather she was mandated to issue an exclusion order.", "44(2) If the Minister is of the opinion that the report is well-founded, the Minister may refer the report to the Immigration Division for an admissibility hearing, except in the case of a permanent resident who is inadmissible solely on the grounds that they have failed to comply with the residency obligation under section 28 and except, in the circumstances prescribed by the regulations,", "in the case of a foreign national.

Il ne peut y rentrer que si l'autorisation le prévoit."], ["[14]", "Upon being satisfied that the applicant was an inadmissible person pursuant to subsection 29(2) of the Act, Regulation 228 states that the immigration officer may issue an exclusion order, which is what happened in the present case."], ["[15]", "Finally, the failure of the immigration officer to provide a reasonable opportunity for the applicant to present evidence on mitigating factors over the course of the subsection 44(2) proceeding, such as his two-year marriage to a Canadian citizen and his outstanding H & C application does not constitute a breach of procedural fairness."], ["[16]", "Justice von Finckenstein in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , states at paragraph 21:", "[...] decisions under ss. 44(1) and 44(2) are routine administrative decisions. Issues relating to humanitarian and compassionate considerations or the safety of the Applicant are obviously vital to the Applicant. They have no place in these routine administrative proceedings.

The only question before the immigration officer in determining whether to issue the order, was whether the information regarding the applicant's inadmissibility was accurate."], ["[19]", "The immigration officer only had to conclude, based on the facts that the applicant did not have the proper status in order to remain in Canada. The standard of review for this type of administrative fact finding decision is that of patently unreasonable.

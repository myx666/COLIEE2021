The Applicant's submissions and her affidavit described the dire situation she would face in the Philippines, including the scarcity of work and the precarious nature of living arrangements in her country of origin. The documentary evidence submitted by the Applicant in support of her H&C application confirmed the devastating effect that Typhoon Haiyan had on her home town, and also substantiated her description of the abject poverty that continues to prevail in that region. Her submissions were not oblique, cursory, or obscure, and they therefore imposed a positive obligation on the Officer to inquire further into the BIOC (", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED).

The reasoning provided for the refusal of Mr. Chen's application is cogent, comprehensive and manifests a detailed consideration and application of the factors articulated in", "Re Koo", ", [1993] 1 F.C. 286 (T.D.). There is nothing in the judge's reasons to suggest that she considered, relied upon, or even turned her mind to the assault charge in determining whether Mr. Chen had satisfied the centralized mode of existence test. In the absence of any indication that the assault charge was a factor in her decision, and in the face of thorough reasons that signify otherwise, I conclude that the assault was not a factor. Accordingly, this argument fails."], ["[12]", "The second argument -- that the judge improperly applied the centralized mode of existence test -- is similarly without merit.

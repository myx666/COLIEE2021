In some parts of the country, unregistered house churches with hundreds of members meet openly with the full knowledge of local authorities who characterize the meetings as informal gatherings to pray, sing and study the Bible. In other areas, house church meetings of more than a handful of family members and friends are not permitted. House churches often encounter difficulties when there membership grows, when they arrange for the regular use of facilities for the specific purposes of conducting religious activities or when they forge links with other unregistered groups or with coreligionists overseas. Meetings of unregistered Protestants in small cities and rural areas may number in the hundreds (Exhibit R/A-1, item 2.3, p. 65). Documentation (Ibid) also highlights, \"Protestant Christians who worshiped outside of government-approved venues or in their homes continue to face detention and abuse, especially for attempting to meet in large groups, traveling within and outside of the country for religious meetings, and otherwise holding peaceful religious assemblies in unregistered venues.\" The documentation (Exhibit R/A-1, item 2.3, p. 66) also reported that unregistered religious groups experienced the most abuses and harassment in Anhui, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Xinjiang provinces."], ["[11] With respect to the situation of religious persecution within the claimant's province of Fujian, there is no persuasive information suggesting that religious persecution is occurring for groups that are as small as the claimant's. Although a number of different commentators have reported on the issue of religious persecution in China, one in particular, China Aid Association (CAA), stands out as being a significant source of up-to-date reporting and detailed accounts of harassment and repression of Protestant house churches in China (Exhibit R/A-1, item 12.4, Information Request CHN102491.E, item 12.5, Information Request CHN102492.E and item 12.7, Information Request CHN102494.E). The report identifies four main targets of persecution: House church leaders, house churches in urban areas, Christian publications and foreign Christians and missionaries living and working in China. With respect to the claimant's particular circumstances, she testified that 22 members were arrested and long term prison sentences were imposed on the pastor and four others. Fifteen received re-education through labour for two and a half years and two had to pay fines. This is an example of an egregious situation where persons were arrested and would reasonably be expected to appear in reports dealing with religious persecution, not only from CAA but amongst the multitude of different resources which strive to inform the world of religious repression in China. Commentators have stated that the Chinese government has a \"less antagonistic\" attitude towards unregistered Protestants than it does towards unregistered Catholics, though it fears \"house\" churches may act as a cover for dissidents (Exhibit R/A-1, item 12.9, Information Request CHN100387.E). What is clear to the panel is that in China, religious persecution of Protestant \"house churches\" does occur, however, it is not general in nature. Such factors as whether there are close links with the West, evangelisation, membership growth to become large-scale congregations, arrangements for regular use of facilities, whether an individual is a leader, rural or urban areas and location within China are all factors to consider."], ["[12] The panel is mindful of the caveat that the number of persecution incidents is likely to be much higher because of censorship in communications (Exhibit R/A-1, item 12.10) and even considered the possibility that not all information is available to commentators. It concludes that since there is a significant amount of information detailing very specific examples from areas much more remote and difficult to access than Fujian, that it is reasonable for the panel to expect to see persuasive evidence that groups such as the claimant's, which are small and not required to register, are being raided and individuals being jailed in Fujian province."], ["[13] Counsel provided documentation (Exhibit C-4, item 133, p. 445) from a determination made by an Australian Tribunal where a citizen from Fujian was found to have protection rights. The panel is not bound by the decision of the Australian panel."], ["[22]", "Thus, it was", "unreasonable", "for the Board to rely on the size of the Applicant's group to find that she does not have good grounds to fear persecution should she return to China and practice in an underground church.", "It is clear that the Chinese authorities continue to raid churches regardless of their size", "VI.", "Conclusion"], ["[23]", "Therefore, for all the above reasons, the application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is remitted for re-determination by a differently constituted panel.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[24]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "the application for judicial review be allowed and the matter be remitted for re-determination by a differently constituted panel.

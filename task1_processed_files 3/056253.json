She married a Canadian citizen in 1988 and became a Canadian permanent resident in 1989. She lived with her husband in Lethbridge, Alberta until 1996. They had two sons there. In 1996, the family moved to Great Falls, Montana so that Mrs Purvis could establish a chiropractic clinic. That was the last year that Mrs Purvis filed a Canadian tax return. In her citizenship application, she explained that she moved back to Lethbridge with her family in 2005 with the intent of selling her clinic in Great Falls."], ["[4]", "However, Mrs Purvis has found it difficult to sell the clinic. Therefore, despite living in Lethbridge, she regularly commutes to Great Falls to keep the business running so that it may retain value and eventually be sold."], ["[5]", "In her citizenship application, Mrs Purvis stated that she usually leaves for Great Falls every Monday morning and returns on Wednesday afternoon. She spends the remaining days of the week in Lethbridge."], ["[6]", "Mrs Purvis applied for Canadian citizenship on February 4, 2012. Accordingly, the four year period for assessing the residence requirement under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act runs from February 4, 2008 to February 4, 2012."], ["[7]", "In her citizenship application, Mrs Purvis declared that she was absent from Canada for 288 days due to her travels to Great Falls. On March 20, 2013, Citizenship and Immigration Canada [CIC] sent her a letter requesting a more detailed accounting of her absences. Mrs Purvis completed and returned a form stating that she had been absent for a total of 304 days. Yet in an attached letter, she explained that she had been absent for 294 days, calculating this number by multiplying 147 trips to the United States by a duration of two days per trip. She also attached her ICES Traveller History report from the Canada Border Services Agency, which shows her recorded border crossings from August 1, 2000 to April 15, 2013."], ["[8]", "On June 18, 2013, Mrs Purvis submitted a Residence Questionnaire and several supporting documents. In the \"Absences from Canada\" section, she referred to the documents she had already sent to CIC."], ["[9]", "On January 18, 2014, CIC invited Mrs Purvis to attend an interview for the purpose of verifying her identity and documents. On February 18, 2014, she was interviewed by a Citizenship Officer, who informed her that she would have to attend an interview with a Citizenship Judge."], ["[10]", "Three days later, the Officer prepared a File Preparation and Analysis Template [FPAT] and placed it on the file for consideration by the Citizenship Judge. The FPAT is a protected document that is not disclosed as part of the certified tribunal record. The Officer swore an affidavit in these proceedings claiming that she wrote in the FPAT that she was unable to assess the respondent's residence in Canada, since she had not provided a detailed list of absences and the ICES report showed that her estimated calculation was inaccurate - because she sometimes returns from the United States on Thursdays, Fridays or even the weekend."], ["[11]", "Mrs Purvis attended a hearing with a Citizenship Judge on April 16, 2014. By decision dated May 27, 2014, the Citizenship Judge approved her citizenship application."], ["[12]", "In his decision, the Citizenship Judge begins by noting that there were 304 days of absence listed in the FPAT. He observes that this leads to 1,156 days of physical presence, which leaves no shortfall because the minimum requirement is 1,095 days."], ["[13]", "The Citizenship Judge then describes Mrs Purvis's oral testimony. She stated that she \"had no life in Great Falls\" and worked there just like someone who works at an oil patch work camp. The reason she filed no taxes in Canada is because all the proceeds of her chiropractic practice remain in the United States. The Citizenship Judge notes that Mrs Purvis is not claimed as a dependent on her husband's tax returns."], ["[14]", "The Citizenship Judge then states that there are \"no apparent grounds for doubting the Claimant's credibility\". He frames the two issues as \"her physical days, and then her (\"Koo-able\") place of residence\"."], ["[15]", "With regard to physical presence, the Citizenship Judge notes that her maximum runs at 1,176 days, on the assumption that the 2008 entries on the IECS report are complete, \"which they cannot be\". If she worked roughly 36 weeks in 2008, which reflects her work year, then her likely physical presence runs to 1,146 days. The Citizenship Judge notes that, when the IECS report becomes regular, she returns early from the United States almost as often as she returns late. In 2010, her longer and shorter stays cancelled each other out."], ["[16]", "The Citizenship Judge admits that he is trying to \"make up for CBSA's failure to record land-border crossings\". It is apparent that Mrs Purvis is inside Canada more often that she is out. The Citizenship Judge affirms that she \"has certainly more than 900 days, almost certainly has more than 1,000 days, and quite possibly has more than 1,095\". Taking her 2/7 days absence ratio as the norm and assuming that she worked \"perhaps 44 weeks a year\", the Citizenship Judge finds that she would have a physical presence of 1,008 days."], ["[17]", "For the \"sake of argument\", the Citizenship Judge proceeds to ask whether Mrs Purvis is \"Koo-able\". She argued credibly that she has no social life in Great Falls. All she does there is work and sleep. However, she never filed income taxes in Canada and was not claimed as a dependent by her husband. The Citizenship Judge explains that \"people normally file their taxes where they consider themselves to be residing\". He says that perhaps her business is taxed in the United States anyway, so \"it may be surmised that she is keeping most of the earnings in the business, against the day she sells or retires\"."], ["[18]", "The Citizenship Judge continues: \"It may be remembered that the family returned to Canada in 2005 for the sake of the kids' hockey (documented), so it might be thought that no other tie to Canada is necessary.\""], ["[19]", "The Citizenship Judge renders the following decision: \"As the physical presence test is the strictest of the residence tests, it must be decided first whether the Claimant probably meets the residence requirement simply in terms of physical presence, and on balance of probability, it seems likely that she does.

In this context, this requirement, in my view, is vital in order to allow this Court to understand why a Citizenship judge made his or her finding on the residence requirement."], ["[31]", "On the facts before him, Justice LeBlanc found a reviewable error.

She offered three estimates of her absences, in good faith, at various stages of the citizenship proceedings: 288, 294 and 304."], ["[38]", "The Citizenship Judge found that even the highest estimate was probably too low. Upon considering the ICES report and Mrs Purvis's explanations, which he deemed credible, the Citizenship Judge adjusted the incomplete ICES entries for 2008 to account for 36 work weeks. He came up with 346 absences, for a physical presence of 1,146 days. The Citizenship Judge observed that the ICES report shows nearly as many early entries as late entries, so that these cancel each other out and render reasonable Mrs Purvis's estimate of 2 absences for every 7 days."], ["[39]", "In the Court's view, it was open to the Citizenship Judge to reach the above conclusion.

There is no merit to this suggestion. The mandate of a Citizenship Judge is to assess residence on the balance of probabilities. The law has never required certainty.

The RPD's single mention of \"heightened risk\" does not render the whole decision unreasonable. When reading the decision, it is apparent that the RPD considered the Applicant's testimony, counsel's submissions and the documentary evidence presented in its assessment of the facts of the case and whether there is a serious possibility of persecution if the Applicant were to return to Sri Lanka. It is thus based on the proper test that the RPD concluded that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee. As for the reference to the requirement of personalized targeting at the end of paragraph 19 of the decision, my reading of the whole paragraph indicates that, in essence, the RPD really applied the test of \"serious possibility\""], ["[23]", "I now turn to the RPD's assessment of the Applicant's well-founded fear of persecution.

This is the profile discussed in the documentary evidence said to have been ignored by the RPD.

Only then did the RPD conclude that:", "The claimant did not indicate any further contact with the paramilitaries or the authorities, and testified that no one in his family, including his siblings, have experienced any problems. The panel finds that the claimant does not possess any of the risk profiles identified by the UNHCR and that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that he would be targeted upon his return. The panel therefore finds that he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution (AR page 11 at para 19)."], ["[25]", "Moreover, in coming to its conclusion that the Applicant lacked a well-founded fear of persecution, the RPD also considered that the Applicant did not mention the STF as an agent of persecution without being prompted by his counsel. The RPD also took into account the Applicant's reason for abandoning his refugee claim in the USA, namely because the house he was staying in was very small and that Canada could help with housing. The case law cited by the Applicant also does not support his argument that refugee claimants do not have to seek asylum in the first country they reach. Contrary to the decision", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Applicant, in the case at bar, did claim refugee protection in the USA. The Applicant also cites the non-published order in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Applicant's explanation that he had no intention of residing in the USA because he had family in Canada and was forced to make a refugee claim while in detention. Also in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , as soon as the Applicant was released from detention, he made his way in Canada to claim refugee protection. The facts of the present case are different. The Applicant never claimed to have family in Canada or said that he wanted to be reunited with his family in Canada. He only discussed his family and friends in Canada when questioned by the RPD as to why the Applicant answered that he did not have family or friends that could assist him financially in Canada when questioned by the Canadian authorities (CTR page 100). The Applicant explained that his family and friends in Canada could help him in \"other ways\" than financially (CTR page 391 at line 30 and following). However, he later stated that he only has distant relatives, but no \"blood relatives\" in Canada (CTR page 396 at line 45). Considering that the Applicant was already staying with a friend in the USA and that he abandoned the refugee claim for better housing in Canada, it was open to the RPD to determine that the Applicant lacks both a subjective fear and a well-founded fear of persecution.

On the second matter, I note that there is a difference between the army and the STF and that it was open to the RPD to draw a negative reference on this point.

En matière de preuve documentaire, la SPR est présumée avoir pris tous les éléments de preuve en considération et elle n'est pas tenue de faire référence à chaque document présenté (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> citant", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  147 NR 317, et", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[24]", "En l'espèce, la lecture de la décision démontre que la SPR a bel et bien tenu compte de la preuve documentaire présentée. Elle a examiné le profil du demandeur en tant que « jeune Tamoul de l'Est et de rapatrié » dans les « conditions sociopolitiques qui changent au Sri Lanka depuis la fin de la guerre en mai 2009 » (dossier du demandeur, page 11, au paragraphe 19; page 10, au paragraphe 17). Il s'agit du profil évoqué dans la preuve documentaire dont on dit qu'il n'a pas été pris en considération par la SPR. Ainsi, celle-ci-ci a bel et bien tenu compte de la preuve documentaire et apprécié la demande d'asile du demandeur en fonction des lignes directrices du HCNUR qui vise les demandeurs d'asile en provenance du Sri Lanka. Ce n'est qu'après l'avoir fait qu'elle a conclu:", "Le demandeur d'asile n'a parlé d'aucun autre contact avec les paramilitaires ou les autorités et a dit lors de son témoignage que personne dans sa famille, y compris les membres de sa fratrie, n'avait eu le moindre problème. Le tribunal estime que le demandeur d'asile n'a pas l'un des profils établis par le HCR et qu'il n'y a pas suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour conclure qu'il serait visé à son retour. Le tribunal conclut donc que le demandeur d'asile ne craint pas avec raison d'être persécuté (dossier du demandeur, page 11, au paragraphe 19)."], ["[25]", "De plus, dans sa conclusion sur l'absence de crainte fondée de persécution, la SPR a aussi considéré que le demandeur n'avait pas mentionné les STF comme agent de persécution avant que son conseil ne fasse une suggestion en ce sens. Elle a également tenu compte du motif invoqué par le demandeur pour avoir renoncé à sa demande d'asile aux États-Unis, à savoir que la maison qu'il habitait était très petite et que le Canada pourrait l'aider à se loger. La jurisprudence citée par le demandeur n'étaie pas non plus son argument selon lequel les demandeurs d'asile n'ont pas à solliciter asile dans le premier pays qu'ils gagnent. Contrairement à l'affaire", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le demandeur en l'espèce a bel et bien demandé l'asile aux États-Unis. Celui-ci cite également l'ordonnance non publiée dans", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  tenu compte de l'explication du demandeur selon laquelle il n'avait pas l'intention de résider aux États-Unis, parce qu'il avait de la famille au Canada, et qu'il avait été forcé de faire une demande d'asile pendant sa détention. Aussi, dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le demandeur s'est rendu au Canada pour faire une demande d'asile dès que sa détention a pris fin. Les faits sont différents dans la présente affaire. Le demandeur n'a jamais prétendu avoir de la famille au Canada, ni affirmé qu'il voulait y être réuni avec sa famille. Il n'a parlé de parents et d'amis au Canada que lorsque la SPR lui a demandé pourquoi il avait répondu n'avoir ni parents ni amis susceptibles de l'aider financièrement au Canada quand la question lui avait été posée par les autorités canadiennes (dossier certifié du tribunal, à la page 100). Le demandeur a expliqué que parents et amis au Canada pouvaient l'aider [traduction] « autrement » que financièrement (dossier certifié du tribunal, page 391, aux lignes 30 et suivantes). Il a toutefois affirmé par la suite qu'il avait des parents éloignés, mais hors liens du sang au Canada (dossier certifié du tribunal, page 396, à la ligne 45). Si on considère que le demandeur séjournait déjà avec un ami aux États-Unis et qu'il y a renoncé à sa demande d'asile pour chercher à mieux se loger au Canada, il était loisible à la SPR d'établir qu'il n'avait ni crainte subjective ni crainte fondée de persécution. Vu tout ce qui précède, l'analyse faite par la SPR de la demande d'asile présentée par le demandeur à titre de réfugié au sens de la Convention est raisonnable. L'intervention de la Cour n'est pas justifiée.", "B.", "La SPR a-t-elle tiré une conclusion appropriée quant à la crédibilité?"], ["[26]", "Le demandeur conteste l'appréciation de sa crédibilité par la SPR en disant que celle-ci n'a pas précisé ce qu'elle croyait ou ne croyait pas comme éléments de crédibilité. Je ne suis pas d'accord. La SPR a effectivement précisé ce qu'elle avait de la difficulté à croire, c'est-à-dire le fait que le demandeur n'ait pas indiqué les STF comme agent de persécution sans une suggestion en ce sens de son conseil. La conclusion tirée par la SPR quant à la crédibilité sur cette question est donc raisonnable. Pour ce qui est de l'autre point, je note qu'il existe une différence entre l'armée du pays et les STF et qu'il était loisible à la SPR de se prononcer défavorablement là-dessus. En ce qui concerne le groupe du renseignement du Secrétariat de la défense, son rôle est important à l'égard de la demande du demandeur et, là encore, il était loisible à la SPR de dire qu'elle aurait eu besoin de plus d'éléments de preuve objectifs sur ce point important.", "C.", "L'analyse de la SPR relative à une PRI à Colombo est-elle raisonnable?"], ["[27]", "La SPR a dit au début de l'audience qu'elle apprécierait la PRI au Sri Lanka, et elle avait interrogé le demandeur sur la possibilité de déménager à Colombo (dossier certifié du tribunal, aux pages 394 et 395). Il revient au demandeur de démontrer qu'il n'existe pas de PRI à Colombo (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La SPR a jugé que rien ne prouvait que les autorités ou les paramilitaires continuaient à s'intéresser au demandeur et a ajouté que celui-ci ne serait pas exposé à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution s'il retournait dans une ville du Sud du Sri Lanka, comme Colombo. Il s'agissait d'une conclusion raisonnable que pouvait tirer la SPR.", "D.", "L'appréciation par la SPR selon laquelle l'extorsion constitue un risque généralisé est-elle raisonnable?"], ["[28]", "Dans la présente affaire, la SPR a évalué la menace d'extorsion pour le demandeur en cas de retour au Sri Lanka et conclu qu'il s'agissait d'un risque généralisé. À l'audience, elle a interrogé le demandeur pour savoir si d'autres gens d'affaires comme lui étaient victimes d'extorsion. Le demandeur a répondu par l'affirmative. La SPR a expliqué dans sa décision que le demandeur avait mentionné que les Tamouls étaient les gens ciblés, et non d'autres personnes. Pour tirer sa conclusion quant à l'existence d'un risque généralisé, la SPR a tenu compte de la preuve présentée et a jugé que tous les membres des collectivités tamoules au Sri Lanka s'exposaient à cette menace d'extorsion. Elle a en outre fait référence, pour tirer cette conclusion, à la preuve documentaire selon laquelle les groupes paramilitaires ciblent les gens d'affaires à rançonner (dossier certifié du tribunal, à la page 214), ce qui semblerait devoir être le cas pour le demandeur, à en juger par son récit à l'appui de la présente demande d'asile. La SPR est donc parvenue à une conclusion raisonnable quant à l'existence de ce risque généralisé.", "VIII.", "Conclusion"], ["[29]", "La décision de la SPR est raisonnable lorsqu'elle est examinée dans son ensemble. La SPR a appliqué le bon critère pour décider si le demandeur était un réfugié au sens de la Convention, elle a tiré une conclusion appropriée quant à la crédibilité et elle a tiré une conclusion adéquate relativement à la PRI. Elle a aussi conclu de manière raisonnable que le demandeur était exposé à un risque généralisé d'extorsion au Sri Lanka."], ["[30]", "Les parties ont été invitées à soumettre des questions en vue de la certification, mais aucune n'a été proposée.", "JUGEMENT"], ["[31]", "LA COUR STATUE que:", "1.

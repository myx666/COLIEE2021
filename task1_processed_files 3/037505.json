Whatever the period of delay between the issuance of a danger opinion and the scheduled removal,", "the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that there has been a material change in circumstances warranting a re-assessment of his risk upon removal", ". If an enforcement officer declines to exercise the discretion to defer the removal of a deportee pending re-assessment, a judicial stay of the removal order will only be granted where the deportee can satisfy the well-established tri-partite test. The requirements of a serious issue, irreparable harm and the balance of convenience are, in my view, appropriate safeguards to ensure that vexatious attempts to forestall removal are dealt with accordingly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[40]", "In any event, the applicant is entitled to an updated risk assessment in light of the considerable passage of time since the issuance of the Danger Opinion and this Court hearing. Accordingly, the Minister must update the risk assessment contained in the Danger Opinion. If the Minister decides that the applicant would not be subject to a risk of torture, risk to his life or of cruel and unusual punishment or persecution, then the applicant can be removed without delay. Only a stay of the execution of the removal order from this Court would prevent the applicant from being removed as soon as reasonably practicable. Such a stay would require that the applicant establish irreparable harm, which is clear, non-speculative evidence that he would suffer personal injury if removed to Sri Lanka. A motion for a stay can be heard by this Court on two days notice and disposed of immediately.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[41]", "For the foregoing reasons, this application for judicial review is allowed in part. The Enforcement Officer was correct in determining that the applicant is not eligible for a PRRA under subsection 112(1) of the", "Act", ". However, the Enforcement Officer erred in declining to suspend the applicant's removal pending a re-assessment of the risk faced by him on removal to Sri Lanka in light of the significant change of circumstances alleged by the applicant.

In light of evidence that there has been a change in country conditions, is a removal officer under a duty to assess whether an applicant has established a \"prima facie\" risk, and to defer removal pending an updated risk assessment to take account of the change of country conditions?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[43]", "The respondent opposes the certification of the first question because the law is clear. A protected person under subsection 115(1) of the", "Act", "cannot make an application for a PRRA under subsection 112(1) of the", "Act", ". I agree that the law is clear.

I also agree that the statutory language is clear.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[44]", "The respondent opposes the certification of the second question because it turns on the facts. I agree that this question is not a question warranting certification. The answer is obvious.

Under the pre-October 1, 1989 system all patent applications were confidential and not available to the public. That remains the case with the applications at issue here. The Patent Office would select claims from the applications that appeared best to cover the subject matter common to all applications, or even draft such claims. These common claims would be presented to each of the applicants who could choose to remain in the conflict proceedings by including some or all of these claims in their application if they were not there already. The applicants were then invited to submit affidavits setting out facts that would establish the date of invention by their named inventors. Some would choose to rely only on the filing date of the application in Canada or a foreign country if the Canadian application claimed priority from such application. When all evidence was in, the Commissioner of Patents would review the evidence and make a determination as to which inventors had first made the invention as described in the subject matter of the conflict claims. Sometimes some inventors were first in respect of some of the claims and other inventors in respect of other claims. The claims would be awarded by the Commissioner to the application of the first inventor of each claim at issue and all the applications would proceed to final examination. However any party to the conflict could, after receipt of the Commissioner's decision, if dissatisfied, commence an action in the Federal Court for a re-determination as to first to invent and consequent award of claims. This is not an appeal nor a judicial review but an action in which a fresh determination is made. In such an action redrafted claims (so-called substitute claims) could be proposed for resolution in the conflict. The Federal Court action would proceed as any other action and would be subject to appeal in the usual way."], ["[6]", "Conflict applications are not available to the public and details of the prosecution of each conflicting application are not discussed with, or divulged to other parties to the conflict."], ["[7]", "The steps of a conflict proceeding are set out in section 43 of the", "Act", "- s. 43(1): identification of a conflict between two or more pending applications, i.e. each of the applications contains one or more claims defining substantially the same invention, or one of the applications contains one or more claims defining the invention disclosed in one of the other applications;", "- s. 43(2): notification of the conflict to the applicants together with a copy of the conflicting claims, and giving them an opportunity to add the conflicting claims or similar claims to their applications;", "- s. 43(3): sending a preliminary notice of conflict to the applicants who have completed their applications according to subsection (2);", "- s. 43(4): invitation to the applicants to avoid the conflict by amending or cancelling conflicting claim(s), or by submitting prior art to the Commissioner, whereupon the Commissioner will re-examine the applications and decide if the subject matter of the conflicting claims is patentable;", "- s. 43(5): sending a formal declaration of conflict once the subject matter has been found to be patentable and applicants have elected to keep the conflicting claims in their applications.

The Applicant suggests that since the Commissioner is aware of the priority date for a given conflict claim in a given patent application, he can presume that the date of invention is at least as early as the priority date, until an applicant asserts an earlier date of invention. The Commissioner is therefore capable of citing such \"less than two year\" references at this time."], ["[23]", "The Applicant suggests that section 41 of the", "Act", "can be applied to allow the applicant to \"swear back\" to establish a date of invention for the purposes of section 27(1)(a) (see para 105, Applicant's Memorandum of Fact and Law)."], ["[24]", "The Applicant further submits that the Commissioner erred when he ruled that disclosure issues would not be assessed at this time, but could be determined at a later stage in the conflict proceeding. While the Commissioner alleges that the remaining issues raised in the Applicant's submissions can be reviewed at a later stage of the conflict, no such provision is found in the", "Act", ", the Manual of Patent Office Procedure, or the Handbook of Patent Examination. This results in the unfair situation where if an applicant loses the conflict to another applicant who is subsequently determined not to be entitled to a patent, for the reasons raised in the submissions, the deserving applicant will not have any opportunity to correct the error, other than asking the Federal Court to start the conflict proceeding all over again."], ["[25]", "The Commissioner's refusal to complete a full patentability analysis as required by section 43(5) of the", "Act", "creates unnecessary procedural and substantive problems as the conflict proceeding will progress, thereby frustrating the Applicant's desire to bring an end to what is already a 30-year patent application process. The Applicant argues that performing a more complete patentability analysis has the potential to greatly simplify and streamline the conflict proceedings and provides examples to that effect."], ["[26]", "The Applicant also alleges that the Commissioner's erroneous refusal to fully review the Applicant's submissions violates their rights of procedural fairness. Under the", "Act", "there is a duty of procedural fairness imposed on the Commissioner to decide if the subject matter of the conflict claims is patentable before requiring that the patent applicant submit evidence to show when he invented the subject matter. At the section 43(4) stage of a conflict proceeding the Commissioner is required to invite submissions on patentability, to evaluate those submissions, and to decide if the subject matter of the conflict claims is patentable. The section 43(5) stage will only begin once the Commissioner has completed his section 43(4) analysis and has decided that the subject matter is patentable (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).

Contrary to the Applicant's submission, the Commissioner cannot \"presume the date of invention\"; the basis of conflict proceedings is to determine the inventorship of claims.

Identifying the date of invention is at the very core of conflict proceedings. As observed by Justice Snider in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in the context of a conflict proceeding, the Commissioner's \"very job was to identify the date of invention ...\" and the \"question of the invention date is not a minor detail\"."], ["[37]", "The cases cited by the Applicant, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,", "General Tire", "and", "Dow Chemical", ", support a finding that the Commissioner's decision was reasonable and that the procedure provided for under the", "Act", "was properly followed."], ["[38]", "The Commissioner does not yet have information by which he would be satisfied, based on \"less than two year\" citations, that any of the subject matter would be unpatentable, since the date of invention has not been assessed. By asking for affidavits attesting to the date of invention, the Commissioner wants to gather all of the information that he needs in order to complete the patentability analysis and therefore satisfy his obligations under sections 43(4) and 43(5) of the", "Act"], ["[39]", "The Court also agrees with the Respondent that the Applicant's allegation that conducting the patentability analysis in the way suggested by the Applicant will result in simplification and expediency is not sufficiently grounded in the facts. Since the conflict proceedings and materials submitted in support of conflict claims are kept confidential, there is no way of predicting the Commissioner's conclusions on patentability with any certainty."], ["[40]", "The Commissioner has not improperly taken away any of the Applicant's rights in the conflict proceedings process.

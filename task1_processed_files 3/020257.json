He has provided proof of relationship and also Canadian passport of stated brother. However, though specifically requested on our IRPA letter, applicant failed to provide any proof of family relation's residency in Canada.

Neither the Act nor the Regulations stipulate the method by which such a fact may be established. Consequently, the visa officers must decide these facts based on the documentation submitted to them by applicants. In this case, the Applicant argued that he submitted pertinent documentation, including a declaration from his brother received before a commissioner in Toronto, as well as Canadian and Indian passport documentation. The Applicant argued that such documentation must be presumed to be true. Yet the visa officer reviewing the matter declined to consider the brother's declaration on the basis that such a declaration was not sufficient proof of the brother actually living in Canada as per the May 15, 2008 notice sent to the Applicant indicating the type of information to supply with his application. This, it was argued, constitutes an unreasonable fettering of discretion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "Second, if the visa officer was of the mind to refuse the statutory declaration of the Applicant's brother, it was argued that he was then under a duty of fairness to inform the Applicant of the matter and give him an opportunity to respond.

Moreover, it is open for visa officers to seek documentation other than statutory declarations to establish such facts. In this case, the Applicant was notified in writing that a statutory declaration would not suffice, and he either neglected or chose not to follow these instructions. In these circumstances, it was reasonable for the visa officer not to consider the statutory declaration as sufficient proof.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "If any duty of fairness applied here, it had been met by the clear notice of May 15, 2008 informing the Applicant of the type of documentation which would be considered for establishing his brother's residence in Canada. The Applicant was thus treated fairly and the visa officer was under no supplemental duty to send the Applicant a second notice when he had disregarded the first.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "In any event, the visa officer was in no position to reconsider his decision concerning the Applicant even if additional information had been provided since the officer was functus officio after reaching his initial decision. The Respondent does not deny that visa officers have discretion to reconsider their decisions in certain limited circumstances where there has been a breach of natural justice or obvious errors or omissions such as an incorrect tally or addition of points, but this is not the situation here.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "The Respondent adds that though this approach may appear at first glance harsh on visa applicants, it is necessary to ensure the administrative efficiency of a burdened system and to ensure finality of the decision-making process related to visa applications. To proceed otherwise would simply add delays to a processing system which is already very long.

The Applicant essentially submits that both the Board and the Appeal Division misconstrued his parole condition and the evidence, and failed to provide adequate reasons for the decision to revoke his day parole. For the reasons that follow, I have come to the conclusion that the application ought to be dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "BACKGROUND  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[2]", "On May 29, 2005, the Applicant was sentenced to 3 years and 6 months imprisonment for three counts of fraud over $5,000 and two counts of failure to comply with recognizance. He was held in custody at the Beaver Creek minimum security institution in Gravenhurst, Ontario.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "As a first time offender serving a sentence for a non-violent crime, the Applicant's case was reviewed by the Board on October 20, 2009, for accelerated parole release pursuant to what was then section 126 (now repealed) of the", "CCRA", ". The Board decided he should be released on day parole subject to the following condition of release (the \"employment condition\"):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "You are not to be employed, paid or unpaid, in a position which provides you with access to the financial records of others or puts you in a position of knowledge, or responsibility, for the management of finances for any other person, business or charity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Applicant's Application Record, Tab 3, Exhibit \"A\", p 15.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "As a result, the Applicant was released on December 13, 2009, to the St. Leonard's House (Peel) on day parole.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "In February 2010, the Applicant accepted a job offer with a company named D-Bor without the approval of his parole officer. This company was in the business of recruiting athletes, connecting them with sports agents, offering them lucrative endorsement contracts, and advertising. After discussion with his employer, the Applicant's supervision team permitted him to continue his employment, with the understanding that the job was an information technology position. During the first supervision appointment, the Applicant informed his parole officer about the possibility of traveling for business. At the second supervision appointment, the Applicant revealed that he had been negotiating with Apple for the supply of computers, iPods and iPads, but assured his parole officer that he had no involvement in financial transactions. Regardless, the parole officer raised concerns that the Applicant was in danger of stepping into the area of finances, contrary to his employment condition.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "Subsequently, the parole officer approved a business trip to London for the Applicant to meet a young golfer. This trip was approved on the premise that the Applicant was the only one available for this appointment and, as an avid golfer, would be able to assess the golfer's skills and future prospects with the company.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "A short while later, the Applicant requested another permit, this time for travel to Vancouver. Initially, the Applicant had planned to leave on April 12, 2010, and to return on April 14, 2010. These travel arrangements changed a number of times. Ultimately, his parole officer believed that the Applicant had decided to shorten his trip to Vancouver to depart on April 13, 2010, but had yet to approve the plan. While the travelling dates were still unresolved, the Applicant presented himself at the 21 Division Peel Regional Police in an attempt to switch his appointed reporting date and time from April 14, 2010 to April 15, 2010 to accommodate his travel plans. During the course of the conversation, the police officer came to believe that the Applicant had breached his employment condition and obtained access to and acquired knowledge of the financial information of another person, namely information about the golfer and his father. He further suspected that the Applicant's employer, Mr. Wells Davis, may have become a victim of fraud. The police opened an investigation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The investigation was inconclusive as the police were unable to contact the golfer or his father. After an interview with the Applicant's employer, the investigating officer was also satisfied that the employer had not been defrauded and, as such, no charges were laid against the Applicant. Nevertheless, the police found that Mr. Davis was not fully aware of the Applicant's criminal history and had entrusted the Applicant with the sole responsibility of running the company - apart from any actual financial transactions - as Mr. Davis had rather limited business acumen and was employed on a full-time basis elsewhere. On May 10, 2010, on the basis of the police investigation, the Applicant's area parole officer recommended that his parole be revoked.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "On July 28, 2010, the Board conducted a hearing and decided to revoke the Applicant's parole on the same day. The Board concluded:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "... there are significant discrepancies between your [the Applicant's] version of events and the information provided by your supervision team. After careful consideration of all of the file information and the interview with you today, the Board is satisfied that you not only breached your employment condition as outlined above, but also, you were deceptive and manipulative by providing a less than truthful description of the scope of your employment duties and your activities to your supervision team. The Board accepts your case management team's statements about the permission given for you to accept only an IT position with the company. Your assertion that your case management team was fully aware of your employment activities is not consistent with your parole officer's expressed concerns about your negotiations with Apple and her reservations about giving you permission to go to London to play golf with a prospective client of the company. Your criminal history involves convictions for fraud and failures to abide by release conditions. The deception evident in your interactions with your case management team is similar to the behaviour involved in your criminal activities. Having found that you breached your employment condition and were deceptive and manipulative with your case management team, the Board has concluded that risk is not manageable for community release. Therefore, your day parole is revoked. ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Applicant's Application Record, Tab 3, Exhibit \"D\", Board Post Release Decision Sheet, p 130.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "On September 27, 2010, the Applicant appealed the Board's decision. On March 4, 2011, the Appeal Division considered the Applicant's appeal and affirmed the revocation decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "THE IMPUGNED DECISION  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The Appeal Division first addressed the Applicant's argument that the Board acted unfairly as it disclosed only one day prior to the hearing, a copy of the police summary of the April 12, 2010 video-taped statement, and then refused to postpone the hearing to give him a sufficient opportunity to prepare, contrary to subsection 141(3) of the", "CCRA", ". The Appeal Division noted that the Board itself had received the police summary on the morning of the hearing and advised the Applicant accordingly. In those circumstances, the document was shared with the Applicant \"as soon as practicable\", as mandated by subsection 141(2) of the", "CCRA", ". As for the argument that the Applicant had not waived his right to receive information 15 days in advance of his hearing, the Appeal Division rejected it since subsection 141(3) refers back to subsection 141(1) and is limited to a situation where an offender has waived the sharing timeframe, which is not the Applicant's situation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "Relying on the audio-recording of the hearing, the Appeal Division further remarked that neither the Applicant nor his counsel requested a postponement of the hearing. In fact, counsel for the Applicant specifically stated that it was not in the Applicant's interest to postpone the hearing. She simply suggested that the Board consider an adjournment at the end of the hearing to obtain the full text of the Applicant's video-taped statement to the police, which the Board declined to do.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "The Appeal Division summed up its decision with respect to the fairness of the hearing before the Board in the following paragraph of its reasons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "In light of the above facts, the Appeal Division is satisfied that the Board acted fairly. You did not request a postponement. In fact, your legal assistant stated that you wished to proceed. She also suggested the option of an adjournment at the end of the hearing if the Board felt it was necessary in order to obtain further information. The audio-recording reveals that you were given a full opportunity to respond to the information contained in the Police Summary. You were well aware of the information and were able to place your video-taped statements in context. Moreover, after the Board had finished questioning you on the Police Summary, it confirmed with you that you had been given the opportunity to appropriately respond to the issues raised in that document. In our view, the Board respected the duty to act fairly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Applicant's Application Record, Tab 3, Exhibit \"F\", National Parole Board Appeal Division Decision, pp 144-145.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "The Appeal Division then dealt with the Applicant's contention that the Board had misunderstood and misinterpreted the exact nature of the employment condition, basing its decision on erroneous and incomplete information. In its decision, the Board had reformulated the employment condition as follows: \"You are not to be employed, paid or unpaid, in a position which puts you in a position of knowledge of finances for any other person.\" According to the Applicant, this is considerably broader than the condition imposed upon him at the time of his release, according to which he was not to be employed in a position that would put him in a position of knowledge or responsibility", "for the management", "of finances for any other person, business or charity. The Appeal Division rejected that argument, and opined that the Board was fully aware of the nature of the Applicant's condition for release. In the Appeal Division's view, the incomplete reference by the Board to the employment-related special condition must be read in the context of its previous finding that the Applicant had breached his condition of release by obtaining knowledge of the finances of the golfer and his father.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "Finally, the Appeal Division did not agree that the Board based its decision on information of questionable accuracy and reliability. The Appeal Division found that the Board had asked fair and pertinent questions regarding the Applicant's behaviour since his release on day parole, had further clarified the file information with his two Parole Officers, and had provided the Applicant with a full opportunity to respond to and rebut any file information that he believed was inaccurate or erroneous. In weighing the information gathered at the hearing, the Board decided to favour the Applicant's file information over his account of the events. This conclusion was open to the Board, according to the Appeal Division, and the Appeal Division was ultimately satisfied that the Board's decision was fair and reasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "ISSUES  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "Counsel for the Applicant and for the Respondent disagree as to the relevant issues raised by this application for judicial review.

In light of those findings, this Court ought to exercise its discretion to review the decision that the Applicant failed to comply with his condition of release and constituted an unmanageable risk to the community even if it is moot.

First of all, the interpretation of the employment condition is a mixed question of fact and law and ought not to be cast as an issue of procedural fairness in an attempt to benefit from a more stringent standard of review.

According to the Applicant, the employment condition comprised two parts: one prohibiting access to financial records and the other prohibiting knowledge or responsibility for the management of finances. He claims that the Appeal Division made the same mistake as the Board when it stated that the condition prohibited the Applicant from placing himself in the position of having knowledge of a person's finances.

In that context, the Board could reasonably be concerned about the Applicant serving in a position where he was essentially running a company geared towards recruiting young athletes, connecting them with sports agents, and offering them lucrative contracts and advertising. Considering the obvious financial ramifications of the Applicant's position, both as related to the company and to its clients, the Board was justified in not accepting the Applicant's statement that his position did not permit him to have knowledge of the clients' finances.

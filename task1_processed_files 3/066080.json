Another key factor in both the deferral decision and the H&C application is the best interests of the Applicants' three-year-old Canadian born child."], ["[3]", "Before determining the deferral request, the Officer went to the trouble to obtain further medical evidence, which was not supplied to Counsel for the Applicant prior to the decision under review being made. The further medical evidence conflicts with the Applicants' evidence and raises a contested issue with respect to the severity of the male Applicant's condition, and the availability of treatment options in Costa Rica. The Officer's statements which constitute the reasons for refusing a deferral are as follows:", "\"Mr. Jeffery feels that this couple should be given a stay on their deportation order until a decision is reached on their Humanitarian and Compassionate application (without sponsorship). The clients filed an H&C on 20DEC2005, which is still in process. It can take 12-18 months for the application to be processed. I do not feel that a deferral of the couple's removal on this basis is appropriate or reasonably practicable. Additionally, the H&C application is not an impediment to removal which is clearly stated in the application guide and should there [sic] not be utilized as a mechanism of impediment to removal. The couple's H&C application will continue without their presence in Canada and if their application is accepted, they may return to Canada.", "\"Medical reports and letters presented to GTEC were forwarded to medical doctors for review. They determined that there was no credible basis for the claim and that removal would not cause irreparable harm. The doctor report states that the 'diagnosis appears to be between post-traumatic stress disorder and pain disorder. The psychiatrist felt pain disorder with psychological features and adjustment disorder with depressed mood and anxiety should be excluded. The other axes for psychiatric diagnosis are all completed with minor L 4-5 degeneration (which is of no consequence).' In addition, subject can continue to receive treatment in Costa Rica as 'there are a number of psychiatrists that are recommended by our embassy or the U.S. embassy. I assume that all these qualified psychiatrists could provide treatment for post traumatic stress disorder. There is a National Pain and Palliative Care Centre in San Jose with a network of similar clinics in other centres as well.", "\"The clients' child is under 3 years of age and can easily integrate into any society her parents decide to relocate to. At the time of PRRA initiation on 21SEPT2005, clients were informed that they would be required to leave Canada within two to three weeks of a negative PRRA decision. The couple have had ample time to plan and make arrangements for their daughter since September in the event of their departure and therefore is not a justifiable reason for deferral.", "\"In my opinion, taking into consideration all of the submissions from the counsel and Mr. Cortes, I do not feel that there are exceptional circumstances in this case that warrant a deferral of removal.

To reach this result, it is clear that, on a pragmatic and functional analysis, strong weight is placed on the factor that a deferral decision is highly fact based, and, therefore, a removals officer is to be accorded deference. Consequently, on these authorities, an applicant has the burden to establish that the decision is \"clearly irrational\" or \"must almost border on the absurd\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 201; 320 W.A.C. 201, at para. 18)."], ["[6]", "With respect, on the basis of the pragmatic and functional analysis which follows, I find that the standard of review of a deferral decision is not patent unreasonableness, but is reasonableness simpliciter."], ["[7]", "The decision in", "Dr. Q., Re", ", [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226; 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170, sets out the factors to consider on a pragmatic and functional analysis to determine the degree of deference to be accorded to the decision-maker of the decision under review: whether a privative clause exists in the legislation in question; whether the reviewing judge can be said to have more expertise than the decision-maker; the purpose of the legislation and the provision; and whether the question being decided is one of law, fact, or mixed law and fact."], ["[8]", "It is agreed that no privative clause exists to limit judicial review of a deferral decision.

On practicability, there is no doubt that the removals officer has expertise, but this is relatively unimportant to the outcome of a deferral request. At the core of a deferral decision is the expertise used in determining the issue of reasonableness. I find that neither a removals officer, nor a reviewing judge, possesses dominant subjective judgment when it comes to weighing the human conditions which are, invariably, integral to a deferral application. Thus, having found three factors that are essentially neutral on the issue of deference, in my opinion, the outcome of the pragmatic and functional analysis depends on whether the deferral decision is one of law, fact, or mixed law and fact."], ["[9]", "In my opinion, a deferral decision is not a question of fact, but is a question of mixed law and fact."], ["[10]", "A question of mixed law and fact involves the application of general principles of the statutory provision concerned to specific circumstances (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.B.R.(2d) 207; 674 A.P.R. 207, at para. 41) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).

Thus, the deferral decision is essentially a complex finding of mixed law and fact.

The question is rather whether the reasons, taken as a whole, are tenable as support for the decision. At all times, a court applying a standard of reasonableness must assess the basic adequacy of a reasoned decision remembering that the issue under review does not compel one specific result.

The legal requirement is clear: the removal is to be immediate, but enforcement is based on practicability; that is, removal is to occur as soon as it is \"able to [be] put into practice\".

A decision on this factor only amounts to a conclusion being drawn on features such as: is the whereabouts of the failed refugee claimant known; is the claimant accessible; is there an available method whereby the claimant can be transported out of the country; and are there persons who can escort the claimant to the airport or drive the claimant to the border? These are not complex operational considerations."], ["[15]", "However, the factor of reasonability adds complexity to the decision making process being conducted. It is on this issue that failed claimants ask for deferral; they know that the removals officer might have the present operational capacity to remove, but argue that, on the factor of reasonableness, they ought not to be removed. It is on this factor that there is wide judicial agreement that a removals officer has discretion. However, there is disagreement on the scope of this discretion. That is, the question becomes: what circumstances will reasonably result in the deferral that the claimant is requesting?

The Applicants' main appeal to the Officer on the reasonableness factor was that their removal should be deferred until their H&C application is decided. The Officer struggled with this submission, and went to a great deal of trouble to analyse the health issues which are at the base of the request. On the one hand, the Officer can be complimented for the effort but, on the other hand, the effort exposed a body of seriously conflicted professional opinion which required careful analysis to determine where weight should be placed. Nevertheless, the deferral request was denied without conducting this analysis. This is not sensible."], ["[18]", "The fact that the Officer sought her own expert opinion on the health issue is some evidence of scepticism about the Applicants' evidence. Indeed, while it is not advanced as a due process issue in the present Application, the fact that the Officer did not provide this conflicting evidence to Counsel for the Applicant for a response, introduces a high level of unresolved controversy into the application to defer. In my opinion, under this condition, it was not possible for the Officer to credibly conclude on the true state of the male Applicant's health. For this reason, I find the Officer's explanation for refusing to defer is untenable. Therefore, I find that the Officer's decision is made in reviewable error."], ["[19]", "In the decision under review, the Officer attempted to conduct an H&C analysis; this is understandable because the Applicants' plea for humanitarian understanding compels this consideration.

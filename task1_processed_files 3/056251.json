The related issue of whether an applicant was a member of an organization referred to in paragraph 34(1)(f) has also been reviewed on a standard of reasonableness, as it is a question of mixed fact and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J.

The FCA has found, and we agree, that the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard requires something more than mere suspicion, but less that the standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the balance of probabilities:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at p. 445;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at para. 60. In essence, reasonable grounds will exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  should also be noted that, in its decision, the Board found the applicant to be complicit in the actions of the MQM. Counsel for each party also made submissions to this Court with regards to the issue of complicity, which it will not be necessary for this Court to address, since the issue of complicity is irrelevant to a determination under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Act, which refers strictly to the notion of membership in the organization. The question of inadmissibility under paragraph 34(1)(f) should thus be distinguished from inadmissibility as a Convention refugee under section 98 of the Act, which relies on article 1F of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, where the ground for inadmissibility is described as having “committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity” and, absent direct proof as to the involvement of the person in a specific crime, requires a finding of complicity with the organization who committed such crime."], ["[12]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J.

The Applicant further submits that \"member\" should be interpreted to mean current and actual or formal membership, including only those who are subject to party discipline and not entitled to act in accordance with independent belief and action.", "¶ 22 To adopt such an interpretation would, I think, be contrary to the spirit of the legislation as well as to prior jurisprudence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  22), rev'd in part (on different grounds), 47 Imm.

However, I note that s. 34(2) effectively exempts them from exclusion. This section provides that those who would otherwise be deemed inadmissible because of certain associations or activities not be so deemed where they can satisfy the Minister that they are not a danger to the security of Canada. This interpretation of the statute was also found to be the case in Suresh (S.C.C.), supra.

No evidence was provided to the effect that he was coerced into joining, or that he was prevented from leaving the organization. In fact, upon arriving in Canada, the applicant joined the Canadian chapter of the organization and is now the head of MQM Quebec.

Furthermore, the “civilians” or the “persons not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of harmed conflicts”, in the definition of terrorism provided by Suresh, above, are meant to refer to random targets, not an identifiable opposition."], ["[19]", "The respondent for his part submits that the applicant’s contention does not resist a careful reading of the Board’s reasons in light of the definition of terrorism as provided in Suresh, above. Indeed, the Board refers to “entire population or even mere political opponents who are not personally involved in the hostilities”, who are clearly blind targets of the acts committed by the MQM. This must also be read in contrast with the Board’s rejection of violence in the context of urban guerrillas, “where people on both sides participated directly in the hostilities”, as evidence of terrorism."], ["[20]", "Since “political opponents” could theoretically be anyone in Pakistan who supports a political organization other than the MQM, and thus a very large segment of the population, I believe that such opponents who are not personally involved in the hostilities would be considered civilians or other persons not taking an active part in the hostilities, as per the Suresh definition of terrorism. Therefore, I agree with the respondent that the definition adopted by the Board was proper and does not justify the intervention of this Court."], ["[21]", "Turning now to the finding of the Board that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the MQM is an organization that engages, has engaged or will engage in terrorism, I reproduce the following excerpt from the Board’s reasons:", "I agree with Me Bertrand’s assertion that, when we look at the reported acts of violence, we must look at them in the context of the climate of political violence that has characterized Pakistan for decades. However, we must also remember that this violence reached endemic proportions in the years during which Mr. Omer was working for the MQM-A.", "The direct actions against identifiable opposition members would not be associated with terrorism in cases of [Translation] “urban guerrilla” battles where people from both sides participated directly in the hostilities. Of the 13 elements – excerpts from the documentary evidence – listed by Mr. Beaupré in the section describing the nature of the group (page 2 of his submissions), number 5 – abduction and counter-abduction of P.P.P. and Mohajir Quaumi Movement student’s activist – and 7 – people were killed almost daily in fighting among factions of the MQM, and between the MQM and sindhi nationalists – can therefore be set aside. However, many of the actions (listed by Mr. Beaupré in his submissions or mentioned in the documentary evidence) in which the MQM, the MQM-A or some of its members were allegedly involved could be considered terrorist acts. It is perfectly clear that intimidation, when supported by violence, torture, assassinations, the use of secret detention centres and bomb attacks, figures among the acts that fall within the scope of the definition of terrorism when they blindly target the entire population or even mere political opponents who are not personally involved in the hostilities.", "Is the documentary evidence that reports these events so lacking in credibility, as Mr. Omer claims, that all of it must be dismissed? I do not think so. Although the organizations that reported the events use terms such as “imputed”, “alleged” or “are suspected of …”, the number of witnesses, some corroboration, and the consistency of the information from these various sources are sufficient to conclude that this specific exhibits are credible and trustworthy. We are talking about intimidation, often accompanied by violence (M-2, p. 38; M-3, p. 1596; M-5, p. 3; M-5, p. 17; M-8, para. 76, M-12, p. 1), rapes (M-2, p. 38), torture, assassinations, the use of secret detention centres (M-2, pp. 37, 38, 39 and 40; M-3, pp. 1588 and 1593; M-4, p. 5, M-5, p. 2; M-8, paras. 76, 78, 81 and 82; M-10, p. 1085; M-11, pp. 2 and 3), bomb attacks (M-10, p. 1088), and terrorist acts in general (M-9, p. 1; M-10; M-12, p. 1).

In particular, there is no analysis of the IRB report, and no identification of which activities on the part of the MQM-A the officer considers to be terrorist in nature. In my view, in light of the seriousness of the finding in issue and its consequences for Mr. Ali, it was incumbent on the officer to provide some explanation for her finding that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the MQM-A is a terrorist organization.

While the Report does state that Amnesty International was unable to independently verify the reports of torture, it goes on to state the information was gathered a variety of sources being members of other political parties, the media, the army, and \"observers\". I find no error in the Member's willingness to give the Report weight for the stated reason that the \"reappearance of similar information and incidents in diverse publications contribute to the trustworthiness of the documents\" (AR, p. 19, para. 31).", "¶ 15 As a result, I have no hesitation in agreeing with Counsel for the Respondent's argument that the evidence contained in Tab 5, while it might be less than proof on a balance of probabilities, is more than a flimsy suspicion.

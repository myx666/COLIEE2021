After all, it was the RPD who heard the witnesses and assessed the probative value of documentary evidence submitted by the parties.

Some deference is also owed, regardless of whether the court has had the advantage of either receiving or not receiving a statutory direction, explicit or by necessary implication.

Deference given to findings of fact or mixed fact and law by a reviewing Court is well known. The following warning again applies: judicial review is not an appeal and is conducted exclusively by superior courts. It is, above all, a review of the lawfulness of the administrative tribunal's decision, whereas the appeal relates to the merit and opportunity to make a different decision from that of the tribunal of first instance. Characterizing a decision as \"unreasonable\", thus allows a court of law, in the absence of a statutory appeal, to ensure that administrative tribunal respects the law and that a palpable injustice will not be committed, so that the legal remedy is to return the matter to the administrative decision-maker and not to make the decision that should have been made."], ["[18]", "The role of a reviewing court is by definition limited. It is well settled by case law. Its analysis will be concerned with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process, and also with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 47). It even goes so far as affording great deference to the interpretation that the administrative tribunal may make of its home statute when it does not concern jurisdiction or a question of law of central importance for the system. This does not refer to a decision that another decision-maker with knowledge of the same facts and the applicable law may have made, but only to a \"reasonable\" decision-even if it is not the best decision in the circumstances and it opens itself to criticism. Further, this is the test that this Court applies to findings of fact, and mixed fact and law, of the RPD in cases where there was no appeal to the RAD (see for example", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It is also the standard of review applied by Member Gallagher in this file and by other members of the RAD up to now. This first approach was rejected by the Court as we will see below, but before examining my colleagues' decisions, let us examine the second approach, which is also applied throughout Canada by the general courts of appeal."], ["[19]", "Indeed, given that the appeal is not a new trial, it must be asked what is the standard of review applicable on appeals with respect to the trial judge's findings. The standard of review applicable to pure questions of law is that of correctness, while following the standard of review applicable to findings of fact, these findings can only be overturned if it is established that the trial judge committed a palpable and overriding error:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Therefore, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada clearly indicated that, in principle, it is not the role of appellate courts to second-guess the weight assigned by a trial judge to the various items of evidence and it is only when the inference-drawing process itself is palpably in error that an appellate court can interfere with the trial judge's finding of fact. In passing, the same high degree of deference should apply to the trial judge's assessment of the credibility of a witness and the other findings of fact ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paras 23 and 24)."], ["[20]", "More specific information as to the scope of the standard of palpable and overriding error was later provided by the Supreme Court of Canada in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (", "HL", ").

In this decision, Justice Shore indicated that the role of the RAD is not that of judicial review, but rather of appeal and that the RAD had to consider all the evidence and make its own assessment (at paras 30-38). However, on questions of fact, Justice Shore indicates that a certain degree of deference is required, which corresponds to the standard of \"reasonableness\" (at paras 2 and 40). It is also a question of \"palpable and overriding error\" (at paras 1 and 39)."], ["[27]", "This is how Justice Shore summarizes his thinking on the subject:"], ["[39] The Court recognizes that it would be absurd, and contrary to subsection 110(3), to task the RAD with re-examining, for every instance, whether the claimants are in fact refugees or persons in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.", "It is clear from the case law that an appellate body cannot substitute its own reasoning for that of a specialized tribunal of first instance, the tribunal of fact, having the advantage of having heard viva voce testimony and with its authority conferred by the", "Inquiries Act", ", unless the trial judge made a \"palpable and overriding error\" that led to an erroneous result", "..."], ["[40] In this case, the Court is entirely in agreement with the RAD that the standard of review to be applied to findings of fact made by the RPD is reasonableness. It is well established that an appellate body must review the findings of a tribunal of first instance by applying a correctness standard to findings that involve questions of law, and applying a reasonableness standard to those involving questions of mixed fact and law ..."], ["[41] That said, the Court finds that in assessing the reasonableness of the decision, the RAD should, at the very least, have reviewed the evidence that was presented before the RPD and conducted an independent assessment of all of the evidence in order to determine whether the RPD, on the basis of the facts and the conditions of the country in question, had properly considered the evidence and reasonably justified its conclusion (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "; Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union,", "above", "; Alberta Teachers' Association,", "above). According to this trio of judgments by the Supreme Court of Canada, the RAD cannot exempt itself from considering the evidence as a whole. [Emphasis added]"], ["[28]", "In this first decision, Justice Shore avoided characterizing the new action before the RAD as an \"appeal", "de novo", "\", such as for appeals brought before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) under section 67 of the IRPA. That said, he nevertheless finds that \"this limitation in no way diminishes the jurisdiction conferred upon the RAD to review the evidence that was before the RPD\" (at para 35). It follows that to determine whether the RPD's decision is \"reasonable\", the RAD must consider the evidence presented to the RPD and conduct \"an independent assessment of all of the evidence\" (at paras 3 and 41). In this regard, it is a variation of the third approach proposing a composite and variable standard of review ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). I will return to this vital point below, given that it is a finding of law that is not shared by certain members of the Court, including Justice Roy, who wanted to avoid the problem resulting from any [translation] \"blurring of lines\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 21)."], ["[29]", "In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and", "Garcia  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , decided at the same time on July 17, 2014, Justice Shore returned to his analysis of the law and this time he breathed new life into the standard of palpable and overriding error that had only been raised in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, as we have seen before. Basing himself on what the Court of Appeal of Quebec wrote in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, and by analogy in the scheme of the IAD, Justice Shore reiterated that the RAD cannot be assimilated to a judicial review body and therefore must not apply the standard of judicial review ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paras 23 to 28;", "Garcia  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 22 to 27). While acknowledging that \"an appeal before the RAD is not an appeal", "de novo\"", "Garcia  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 25; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 26), Justice Shore explains further:"], ["[29] ... When analyzing a decision of the RPD, the RAD must not merely determine whether it was made in a reasonable manner, but, rather, analyze whether the RPD relied on a wrong principle of law or misassessed the facts to the point of making a palpable and overriding error ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above)."], ["[30] \"Palpable and overriding error\" is often used interchangeably with the \"clearly wrong\" or \"unreasonable\" decision test. However, this is the appellate-level standard of intervention that a specialized appeal tribunal such as the RAD must apply when reviewing a decision and not the judicial review standard of reasonableness. Even though there are similarities, these standards are different.

The result is that the RAD had committed a reviewable error by using the standard of review of reasonableness rather than that of palpable and overriding error. In summary, according to Justice Shore, the RAD must conduct its own assessment of all the evidence, but in doing so, it still owes some deference to the RPD's findings of fact, because it is the tribunal of first instance and it has the advantage hearing testimony", "viva voce", "( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 34;", "Garcia  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 33).

Where its assessment departs from that of the RPD, the RAD must substitute its own decision."], ["[55] In conducting its assessment, it can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion but it is not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on facts only where there is a \"palpable and overriding error\".

Therefore, the use of the standard of reasonableness was not determinative; Justice Locke dismissed the application for judicial review. However, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Locke determined that, since some findings of the RPD on the credibility of the applicant were not based only on her testimony, but also on evidence in the record, the RPD enjoyed no advantage over the RAD when it made its findings and the RAD had to reconsider the evidence on this topic ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paras 21-25).

That was also the case with Justice Phelan, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, when he decided that the RAD was required to hear the matter as a \"hybrid appeal\". In the alternative, counsel for the respondent argued that the standard of \"palpable and overriding error\" should be applied, if the first approach, i.e. the reasonableness standard of judicial review, is not used."], ["[42]", "As we said above, standards of review are judicial creations. Nonetheless, once established, they must be respected by the courts just as any other rule of law. And what gives the rule of law its precedence is its universality: It applies equally to all; there is no place for judicial or administrative discretion. Further, following the principle of judicial comity and, unless certain exceptions apply, a judge of this Court should not deviate from decisions made by his or her colleagues to avoid creating a situation of uncertainty in the law. It would be expected that the principle of judicial comity is particularly important in immigration matters, since under the IRPA, decisions of this Court may uniquely be subject to an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal if a question of general importance is certified. Therefore, it is desirable to have some consistency in the Court's decisions. Yes, the judge can make the law, but when each judge makes his or her own law, the rule law that is no longer applied withers. To use descriptive language, the law loses weight and this unbearable lightness of being makes it irrelevant, leaving more room than is needed for administrative or legal discretion."], ["[43]", "Today, I feel as though I face an Olympic dilemma: I am asked to choose between two contradictory approaches (the first approach having been eliminated) adopted by colleagues of the Court. As Justice Wilson stated in", "Re Hansard Spruce Mills Ltd", ", [1954] 4 DLR 590 (BCSC), the statements of which were recalled by this Court in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :", "I have no power to overrule a brother Judge, I can only differ from him, and the effect of my doing so is not to settle but rather to unsettle the law, because, following such a difference of opinion, the unhappy litigant is confronted with conflicting opinions emanating from the same Court and therefore of the same legal weight."], ["[44]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Lemieux summarized the possible exceptions to the principle of judicial comity:"], ["[61] The principle of judicial comity is well-recognized by the judiciary in Canada. Applied to decisions rendered by judges of the Federal Court, the principle is to the effect that a substantially similar decision rendered by a judge of this Court should be followed in the interest of advancing certainty in the law ..."], ["[62] There are a number of exceptions to the principle of judicial comity as expressed above they are:", "1. The existence of a different factual matrix or evidentiary basis between the two cases;", "2. Where the issue to be decided is different;", "3. Where the previous condition failed to consider legislation or binding authorities that would have produced a different result, i.e., was manifestly wrong; and;", "4. The decision it followed would create an injustice."], ["[45]", "I repeat: the principle of judicial comity aims therefore to prevent the creation of conflicting lines of jurisprudence and to encourage certainty in the law. Generally, a judge should follow a decision on the same question of one of his or her colleagues, unless the previous decision differs in the facts, a different question is asked, the decision is clearly wrong or the application of the decision would create an injustice. Judicial comity requires much humility and mutual respect. If the rule of law does not tolerate arbitrariness, judicial comity, its loyal companion, relies on reason and the good judgement of each person. Failing a final judgment from the highest court, respect for the other's opinion can speak volumes. In short, judicial comity is elegance incarnate in the person of the magistrate who respects the value of precedents."], ["[46]", "From the point of view of the facts, this case does not call for a reconsideration of the principles of law applicable or for a new interpretation of sections 110 and 111 of the IRPA. The issue is always the same question of law or of jurisdiction relating to scope of the appellate review conducted by the RAD. Further, it cannot be said that Justices Shore, Phelan or Roy did not thoroughly canvas the relevant law or case law. However, they seemed to interpret the law differently and contradictorily, as we saw above. Let us begin with the simplest. The learned counsel for the respondent did not succeed in persuading me that the exclusion by my colleagues of the first approach discussed above is clearly wrong in law. For the same reasons as my colleagues, I conclude that in applying the standard of judicial review of reasonableness, Member Gallagher committed a reviewable error in law: the RAD is an appellate body, not a judicial review body and it must not assess its role based on criteria of judicial review. The matter must be returned to the RAD. Now, let us discuss the rest. I chose the middle path, that of wisdom: allow the RAD to apply the second or third approach as long as the question of the scope of the appellate review of the RPD's decisions has not been settled by a final judgment by the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada. Quite simply."], ["[47]", "In his appeal before the RAD, I note that the applicant disputes the findings of generalized risk and implausibility. Counsel have taken before me contradictory positions regarding the qualification and treatment to be given to these two findings of fact. There is no agreement on either side of the very notion of credibility, or on the applicable test for the inferences that may be drawn by the RPD from the documentary evidence. The difficulty today is that neither counsel was really able to explain to the Court how the application of the test of palpable and overriding error or of hearing the matter as a hybrid appeal translate in practice in this case. Because of its expertise, as a specialized appeal tribunal, I feel that it is the kind of question that the RAD can easily settle and should have the chance to decide, preferably before the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada do (without having perhaps the benefit of knowing the RAD's point of view)."], ["[48]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FC) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), the Court stated that even if it had the jurisdiction to refer the case back for determination in accordance with such directions as it considers to be appropriate, the Court should leave the specialized tribunals the right to exercise their jurisdiction and make decisions on merit based on the evidence before them (at para 18). Therefore, it is only in exceptional cases that the Court will give directions equivalent to a directed verdict and this power will only be rarely used when the issue is of a factual nature ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 18;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[49]", "Moreover, the RAD has the power to standardize the law by decisions that have the value of precedent. In this regard, section 163 of the IRPA provides that before all divisions of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), matters are heard by a single member unless the Chairperson considers it necessary to designate a three-member panel. According to the IRB Web site, when it concerns the RAD, the Chairperson will constitute a three-member panel if at least one of the following criteria is met:", "- The appeal raises unusually complex or emerging legal issues.", "- The appeal raises an issue in an area in which there is significant divergence or inconsistency in decision-making at either the RAD or the RPD.", "- The appeal raises a serious question of general importance.", "- The appeal raises an issue that may have a significant impact on practice and procedure at either the RAD or the RPD.", "- Any other relevant circumstances exist that make it appropriate that a three-member panel be designated."], ["[50]", "Member Gallagher, who made the impugned decision in January 2014, cannot be criticized for not considering the case law of the Court cited above. It simply did not exist. However, in this file and in the future the RAD should reassess the scope of the review that it conducts on appeal in light of the precedents of the Court, which propose two different approaches. That said, nothing prevents the Chairperson of the IRB to constitute a three-member panel of the RAD to hear the case, which could confer the value of precedent on the RAD decision under paragraph 171(", ") of the IRPA, and on the approach used."], ["[51]", "For practical reasons, if we wish to be pragmatic, our Court may have to resolve-so long as the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada have not ruled on the issue-not to intervene in judicial review when the RAD applies the second or third approach. That is what the Court had resolved to do in the citizenship appeals while the citizenship judges could opt for either of the three approaches developed by Justices Muldoon and Reed, and Associate Chief Justice Thurlow (as he then was) (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 432). In this case, since it is impossible for the RAD to simultaneously follow both approaches, there would be chaos if each judge of this Court adopted one of the two approaches and referred back to the RAD the decisions that applied the other approach instead."], ["[52]", "In our hierarchical justice system, the RAD must give effect to the judgments of this Court and it should wait for the", "urbi et orbi", "benediction of the Federal Court of Appeal or of the Supreme Court of Canada itself, before imposing any desire to apply the reasonableness standard of judicial review in any appeal of an RPD decision. Prudence is required, I do not believe that it would be wise on my part to speculate on this topic, or to express a final opinion regarding the scope of the RAD's appellate review. If it can be said that the first approach became moot (the standard of judicial review of reasonableness was rejected by the Court), the person who could predict today which of the other two approaches would finally prevail would be quite clever; especially since the situation could again change as other judges choose to rule on the issue."], ["[53]", "In conclusion, whether it is a question of jurisdiction or a question of interpretation falling within the RAD's specialized expertise, in this case, the applicant did not have the appeal that he is allowed under the IRPA since the RAD chose to apply a standard of review of reasonableness corresponding to an application for judicial review, such that this application for judicial review must be allowed and the matter returned to the RAD for redetermination of the appeal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at paras 2, 3 and 47)."], ["[54]", "Counsel for the respondent proposes that the Court certify the following question: [translation] \"Considering the legislative framework of the RAD, what is the scope of the review conducted by the RAD on appeal when it considers an appeal of an RPD decision? Specifically, in what circumstances must the RAD show deference to the RPD's findings?\""], ["[55]", "Counsel for the applicant objects to the certification of a question. Indeed, the question of the scope of the review conducted by the RAD on appeal is essentially a question of jurisdiction or of law and we must avoid a multiplicity of appeals raising the same questions."], ["[56]", "In this case, the same question was proposed by the respondent to Justice Phelan in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, and after the Court's verification, he certified it in the following words: [translation] \"What is the scope of the review conducted by the Refugee Appeal Division when it considers an appeal of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division?\" The certification of the question proposed by counsel for the respondent is thus redundant. Counsel for the respondent did not persuade me in this case that it would be in the interest of justice to certify the question proposed above or that the particular factual background of this case justifies the multiplicity of concurrent appeals that arise from substantially the same questions of law or of jurisdiction regarding the interpretation of the scope of the review conducted by the RAD on appeal."], ["[57]", "As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the provision preventing any appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal unless a question is certified \"fits within a larger scheme designed to ensure that a claimant's right to seek the intervention of the courts is not invoked lightly, and that such intervention, when justified, is timely\" (at para 23).

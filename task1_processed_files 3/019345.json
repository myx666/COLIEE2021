{"id_": "019345", "body_str": [["[1]", "Denault, J.", ": The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated September 27, 1993, wherein, pursuant to s. 77(3) of the", "Immigration Act", ", it allowed the respondent's appeal against the decision of a visa officer refusing the sponsored application for permanent residence from outside of Canada made by the respondent's wife. The visa officer concluded that the sponsored applicant (the wife) entered into marriage primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada and did not have the intention of residing permanently with her spouse pursuant to s. 4(3) of the", "Immigration Regulations"], ["[2]", "The respondent (the husband) was a citizen of India. In 1983, he obtained permanent resident status in Canada. He testified that his parents were pressuring him to remarry, especially for the purpose of having a son to carry on the family name. He decided to get married for that purpose."], ["[3]", "The respondent married the sponsored applicant on August 19, 1992 in India. This marriage came about when the sponsored applicant's cousin met the respondent in 1989. The cousin initiated the arrangements between the two families for this marriage. The cousin testified that prearranged marriages of this kind were not unusual in the Indian culture."], ["[4]", "Shortly thereafter, the respondent sponsored an application for landing for his wife to Canada. The visa officer refused to approve the application on the grounds that the sponsored applicant is a member of an inadmissible class described in paragraph 19(2)(d) of the", "Immigration Act", ". In a letter dated March 1, 1993, he concluded that the sponsored applicant did not disprove both elements in s. 4(3) of the", "Immigration Regulations", ". Section 4(3) reads as follows:", "\"4(3) The family class does not include a spouse who entered into the marriage primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada as a member of the family class and not with the intention of residing permanently with the other spouse.\""], ["[5]", "According to the visa officer, the sponsored applicant entered into a spousal relationship with the respondent for the primary purpose of gaining admission to Canada and she failed to demonstrate her intention to reside permanently with her husband. The respondent appealed the visa officer's decision pursuant to s. 77(3) of the", "Immigration Act"], ["[6]", "The Appeal Division concluded that in order to disqualify a spouse under s. 4(3) of the", "Regulations", ", the full test must be applied by the visa officer. First, a marriage must be found to have been entered into primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada and second, there must be no intention on the part of the prospective immigrant to reside permanently with the sponsoring spouse, the husband in this case. The Board, in applying the test set out in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), stated the following:", "\"In my opinion, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that the Visa Officer, other than the interview with the applicant in what appears to be a leading manner, turned his mind to the second prong of the test. In other words, the test is very simple. In order for an appellant to succeed in an appeal of this kind, all that he or she has to prove is one of the prongs of the test, while a refusal can stand only if both prongs are supported.\" [See Footnote 1]", "The Board member further stated:", "He", "[the respondent] intends to live with his wife. It is", "his", "concrete opinion", "that she intends to do so as well, once she is allowed to come to Canada.\" (emphasis mine) [See Footnote 2]"], ["[7]", "The Board found that the answers provided by the sponsored applicant during her interview with the visa officer do not reveal an intention not to reside permanently with the respondent in Canada. The Board therefore determined that the sponsored applicant intended to reside permanently with her husband once she was admitted to Canada. The appeal was allowed."], ["[8]", "Counsel for the applicant argued that the Appeal Division has erroneously placed the burden of proof on the visa officer rather than on the sponsored applicant to prove that she had the intention of permanently residing with her husband in Canada. It was submitted that the onus lay on the sponsored applicant to demonstrate that she was eligible for landing under ss. 2 and 4 of the", "Immigration Regulations", ". It was not the visa officer's responsibility to demonstrate ineligibility."], ["[9]", "Furthermore, counsel for the applicant submitted that the Appeal Board member erroneously focused on the", "respondent's", "belief that his spouse had the intention of residing with him rather than the", "sponsored applicant's", "intentions. Counsel referred to the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, the facts being similar to the case at bar in which Justice Noel stated the following:", "\"Furthermore, the Appeal Division misconstructed its statutory mandate in holding that the respondent's belief that her sponsored husband intended to live with her permanently in Canada was determinative of the issue before it. Its prime task was to test that assertion against the relevant facts and ascertain whether it could be supported objectively.\" [See Footnote 3]"], ["[10]", "I agree with this reasoning. Although the Appeal Board member properly placed the onus on the sponsored applicant to prove the two factors set out in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test with respect to s. 4(3) of the", "Immigration Regulations", ", he misapprehended the evidence before him. In deciding whether the sponsored applicant had the intention of permanently residing with her husband in Canada, the Board must look at the sponsored applicant's intentions, not the husband's beliefs or intentions. The Appeal Division failed to consider the clear and uncontradicted evidence of the sponsored applicant. Instead it based its decision on the opinions and beliefs of the respondent and the sponsored applicant's cousin. The Appeal Board therefore failed to consider the proper evidence in deciding whether the sponsored applicant had the intention of residing permanently with her husband."], ["[11]", "Counsel for the applicant also maintained that s. 4(3) of the", "Immigration Regulations", "must be read in its entire context. That is, the two elements contained in s. 4(3) do not represent distinct and separate tests. Evidence which is relevant to the first element can be relevant to the second element of the test. Therefore, the sponsored spouse's motivation to marry can be relevant to the assessment of an intention to reside permanently with her husband."], ["[12]", "I agree. Even if the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case sets out a two prong test, it does not necessarily mean that the answers given in response to the first element of the test cannot be used to analyze the second element of the test. In other words, evidence relevant to the issue of entering a marriage primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada can be relevant to the assessment of the intention of residing permanently with the sponsoring spouse."], ["[13]", "In the present case, the husband and the sponsored applicant's cousin did not contradict the sponsored applicant's testimony with respect to her intentions of permanently residing with her husband. Instead they expressed their own opinion regarding the sponsored applicant's intentions of residing with her husband. The Appeal Board accepted their opinions without examining the actual intentions of the wife. It was the sponsored applicant's responsibility to prove that she really had the intention of residing permanently with her husband once in Canada."], ["[14]", "For these reasons, the application for judicial review is allowed and the Appeal Division decision of September 27, 1993 is set aside.

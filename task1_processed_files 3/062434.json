Is execution of the formal contract as step in carrying out an already enforceable agreement, like a conveyance under an agreement to buy land, or is it a prerequisite of any enforceable agreement at all? Again, the test must be the reasonableness of the parties' expectations. Has the promisor committed himself to a firm agreement or does he retain an element of discretion whether or not to execute the formal agreement? In the former case there is an enforceable agreement. In the later there is none. If the promisee's expectation of a firm commitment is a reasonable one it will be protected even though the formal document is never executed. Again, the courts seem particularly ready to protect such an expectation when it is manifested in conduct in reliance on the agreement."], ["[35]", "This is the approach that has been taken by the Supreme Court of Canada in", "Calvan Consolidated Oil and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Judson J. for the Court at page 261:", "...Whether the parties intend to hold themselves bound until the execution of a formal agreement is a question of construction and I have no doubt in this case.

In the former case there is no enforceable contract either because the condition is unfulfilled or because the law does not recognise a contract to enter into a contract. In the latter case there is a binding contact and the reference to the more formal document may be ignored."], ["[36]", "A similar approach has been taken by the Ontario Supreme Court in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Gauthier J. wrote at paragraphs 96 to 98:", "96 When parties have a mutual intention to create a legally binding agreement and have reached agreement on all of the essential terms of the agreement, they create a contract.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  As was stated at paragraph 44 of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : A determination as to whether a concluded agreement exists does not depend on an inquiry into the actual state of mind of one of the parties or on the parole evidence of one party's subjective intention."], ["[37]", "The Plaintiffs rely particularly on two decisions of Appellate Courts in Canada where it was held that the parties had reached an agreement notwithstanding the contemplation of further documents to be prepared and signed. One is the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in which Chief Justice McEachern for the Court wrote at pages 122 to 123:", "It should not be thought that every disagreement over documentation consequent upon a settlement, even if insisted upon, amounts to a repudiation of a settlement. Many such settlements are very complicated such as structured settlements, and the deal is usually struck before the documentation can be completed. In such cases the settlement will be binding if there is agreement on the essential terms. When disputes arise in this connection the question will seldom be one of repudiation as the test cited above is a strict one, but rather whether a final agreement has been reached which the parties intend to record in formal documentation, or whether the parties have only reached a tentative agreement which will not be binding upon them until the documentation is complete. Generally speaking, litigation is settled on the former rather than on the latter basis and, parties who reach a settlement should usually be held to their bargains. Subsequent disputes should be resolved by application to the court or by common sense within the framework of the settlement to which the parties have agreed and in accordance with the common practices which prevail amongst members of the bar. It will be rare for conduct subsequent to a settlement agreement to amount to repudiation."], ["[38]", "The other is a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Robins J.A. for the Court wrote at pages 103 to 104:", "As a matter of normal business practice, parties planning to make a formal written document the expression of their agreement, necessarily discuss and negotiate the proposed terms of the agreement before they enter into it. They frequently agree upon all of the terms to be incorporated into the intended written document before it is prepared. Their agreement may be expressed orally or by way of memorandum, by exchange of correspondence, or other informal writings. The parties may \"contract to make a contract\", that is to say, they may bind themselves to execute at a future date a formal written agreement containing specific terms and conditions. When they agree on all of the essential provisions to be incorporated in a formal document with the intention that their agreement shall thereupon become binding, they will have fulfilled all the requisites for the formation of a contract. The fact that a formal written document to the same effect is to be thereafter prepared and signed does not alter the binding validity of the original contract.", "However, when the original contract is incomplete because essential provisions intended to govern the contractual relationship have not been settled or agreed upon; or the contract is too general or uncertain to be valid in itself and is dependent on the making of a formal contract; or the understanding or intention of the parties, even if there is no uncertainty as to the terms of their agreement, is that their legal obligations are to be deferred until a formal contract has been approved and executed, the original or preliminary agreement cannot constitute an enforceable contract. In other words, in such circumstances the \"contract to make a contract\" is not a contract at all. The execution of the contemplated formal document is not intended only as a solemn record or memorial of an already complete and binding contract but is essential to the formation of the contract itself."], ["[39]", "The Defendants argue that there was no contract. In particular, they say that there was never a meeting of the minds; no offer was ever matched in equal terms by acceptance. They cite Professor McCamus' book,", "The Law of Contracts", ", 2nd ed., Irwin Law, Chapter 2 at page 31:", "In the calculus of offer and acceptance, the communications of the parties must have created an \"offer\" that sets out the offeror's willingness to enter into an agreement on certain terms; this is then matched with a corresponding agreement or \"acceptance\" forthcoming from the other party, the offeree, which also communicates a willingness to enter into an agreement on the proffered terms. The acceptance must precisely match the terms of the offer, a proposition often referred to as \"the mirror image rule\". A purported acceptance that indicates different terms cannot create the required consensus. Under the orthodox analysis, the offeree must intend to accept the offer."], ["[40]", "As an illustration of a discussion concerning absolute and unequivocal offer and acceptance, the Defendants provide the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Justice Estey (as he then was) for the Court wrote at page 237:", "With great respect to the learned judges who hold a contrary opinion, there does not appear to be here present either in the letter of August 24 or in the conduct of the appellant that absolute and unequivocal acceptance of terms required by the authorities to conclude a contract.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and conversations are considered it is clear that the parties had not agreed upon the terms of a contract."], ["[41]", "From this jurisprudence, I draw the following principles:", "• for there to be a binding contract, there must be an offer and acceptance wherein the terms of the offer are matched by the terms of the acceptance;", "• the acceptance must be unequivocal;", "• there can be an offer and acceptance so as to create a binding contract even where the parties contemplate the execution of a more formal document;", "• negotiations as to the more formal document do not necessarily mean that an offer or acceptance has been repudiated."], ["[42]", "The Court must apply a subjective standard, not an objective one, as to whether there has been a binding contract.

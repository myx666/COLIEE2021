She required a score of 67 points to immigrate to Canada. On October 17, 2006, the application was screened by the Officer, and she was awarded a score of 68 points, including five points for adaptability based on the fact that the male applicant had a brother, Huang Hai, living in Canada. Additional documents were requested including updated proof of the brother's residency in Canada. Documents were received on January 17, 2007."], ["[6]", "The processing of the file was delayed due to a concern about the genuine nature of the principal applicant's employment.

She noted that no points were awarded for the male applicant's brother, Huang Hai, living in Canada. She determined that the evidence provided by the applicants in support of this allegation was insufficient to establish that the brother resided in Canada at the time of the decision, based on the fact that the majority of the documentation provided related to the brother's wife and not him.

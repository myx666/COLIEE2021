The female applicant is a cousin of one of his father's former students, Sun Li. Because of this relationship, the male applicant's father had invited the female applicant to visit them in the summer of 2008. The male applicant's sister provided a letter of invitation in support of the female applicant's visitor's visa application. Included in the application was a letter that said that the female applicant was going to be married to a boyfriend in China. The female applicant testified that at the time that she completed that application, her English was not good and she relied upon a friend to help with documentation. She stated that she had simply signed her name to the documents prepared for her. This first visa application was refused.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "In October of 2008, the male applicant accompanied his parents on a trip to China. The applicants first met on October 12, 2008, when the female applicant picked the male applicant and his parents up from the train station in Tianjin. The male applicant's parents had arranged to stay at Sun Li's house. Because Sun Li did not have enough space for the entire family in her apartment, she arranged for, the female applicant, her cousin, to host the male applicant in a spare bedroom in the apartment that she shared with her mother.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The family arrived in Tianjin on a Sunday. The female applicant had arranged to take the Monday and Tuesday off work to show the male applicant around Tianjin while his parents were elsewhere. The male applicant testified that once they met and realized how much fun they had together, she arranged to take the rest of the week off work. Although she wanted to take the second week off, too, she was unable to get the time, but she was able to come home early every day so that they could spend the afternoons and evenings together. Moreover, because the family had arranged to spend the weekend prior to their return to Canada in Beijing, the applicants arranged for the female applicant to join the male applicant's family on the trip, so that they could spend more time together.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "In the male applicant's words, during the two weeks that he spent in China the applicants' relationship evolved tremendously:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "It happened gradually. I mean, the first few days it was I like you, then it was more, then it was I care about you and I want to see you more.

In those emails, the female applicant suggests that if she is unsuccessful in obtaining a visitor's visa to come to Canada, she and the male applicant should marry in China and then re-apply for a visa for her. She then asks the male applicant what he thinks, and whether he would like to marry her. In his responding email, the male applicant states that he agrees that if he is unable to get the visitor's visa arranged, then they should marry in China. He goes on to state that he wants to marry her and did not realize that it was still a question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "In March of 2009, the female applicant submitted a second application for a visitor's visa. On that application, the female applicant had to list the names, addresses, and relationships of the people or institutions that she will visit. She lists the male applicant's father and his sister, both of whom she listed as \"friend\", but not the male applicant. The male applicant testified that he did not know why she did not include the male applicant's name. He stated that \"as far as I can see it's because I was a travelling companion rather than a destination of a visit.\" The male applicant testified that the purpose of her visit was to be for the applicants to travel around Canada and see how his family lived [*4,33*] therefore to stay with his sister and her family for several days, and to visit his parents. When asked why he had not been listed as her fiancé, the male applicant testified that his Member of Parliament had advised against it, stating that the application was more likely to be successful if it identified his sister as the female applicant's friend. This second visa application, too, was refused.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "The male applicant subsequently made two trips to China to visit the female applicant. On the first trip, they had a civil marriage in China, which was registered on June 10, 2009. Following the civil ceremony, they had a dinner with about 12 members of the female applicant's family.

The testimony of the appellant and the applicant is substantially consistent; however, there are a number of aspects of the evidence before me that raise credibility concerns, both in relation to the genuineness of the marriage and the primary purpose component of the above referenced test.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "In particular, the Board was concerned about elements of the evidence regarding (1) the female applicant's visitor visa applications in May 2008 and March 2009; (2) the consummation of the applicants' marriage; and (3) the focus of the applicants' emails to one another.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[22]", "With regard to the temporary visa applications, the Board found that they revealed the following \"significant discrepancies\" between the evidence as presented at the hearing and as presented in the applications:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "1. The May 2008 temporary visa application described the female applicant as having worked in the United Arab Emirates for about 6 months (from November 2003 to April 2004) as a \"statistician\" for an \"accounting\" business, but both applicants testified to the Board that she had worked in a restaurant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "2. The May 2008 temporary visa application states that the applicant intended to visit the male applicant's sister, while the applicants' testimony revealed that the intention was to visit the male applicant's father, but they felt that the visa would be more likely to be granted if they said otherwise.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "3. The May 2008 temporary visa application includes a letter signed by the female applicant that appears to refer to the female applicant's intention to marry a former boyfriend. At paragraph 7, the Board found that the female applicant's explanation for this letter[*4,34*] that her friend helped her to write it and that she did not look at it before signing[*4,34*] was not credible, because (1) the female applicant's language training, which was sufficient to allow her to communicate with the male applicant, had all been completed by that time, and (2) the numerous references to a wedding and a boyfriend in the letter would allow even a \"cursory\" review by someone with \"a limited knowledge of English\" to discover its alleged inaccuracies. The Board concluded as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "On all of the evidence before me, I conclude that the applicant was aware of the contents of this letter and signed it in an effort to obtain a temporary visitor visa to Canada, through false representations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "4. The applicants both testified that they had decided to marry at least by November 2008. But in the female applicant's March 2009 visa application, she did not mention the male applicant. Moreover, the male applicant's sister was the only person who submitted a letter in support of the visa. The Board concluded that the applicants had not provided the real reason for this omission in their testimony before it:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[*4,5*] 11. ... On the whole of the evidence before me, I conclude that the appellant and the applicant made a conscious decision not to mention the appellant, in the temporary visitor application in March 2009 and not to mention any intention to get married. The appellant has, in essence, acknowledged that omitting this pertinent information was designed to induce immigration authorities to issue a visa, without having the opportunity to consider the withheld information.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "5. Overall, the Board concluded that the applicants' credibility was severely tarnished by these facts:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[*4,5*] 12. The manner in which the appellant, the applicant and the appellant's sister conducted themselves in relation to these temporary visa applications undermines their credibility, specifically in relation to attempts to obtain a visa for the applicant and each person was willing to falsify, withhold and \"nuance\" the information provided to the visa office to achieve this objective.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "With regard to the consummation of the marriage, the Board found that the fact that the applicants had not consummated their marriage was a relevant consideration, and found that the explanations for the lack of consummation were not credible.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "The applicants testified that in the area where the female applicant lives, and based on her family attitudes, the female applicant would be stigmatized if she married someone and then he left her to return to Canada. They stated that they were waiting to have their traditional wedding for the time when the two could live together continually. The male applicant's father, who had spent more time in the region than the male applicant, testified to confirm this understanding of attitudes to marriage. The Board noted, however, that there was no expert evidence tendered regarding marriage traditions of the female applicant's home region.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "The Board found that even if traditions in the female applicants' region were as described, that did not explain why the applicants' own relationship had followed such a traditional trajectory. The Board found that the female applicant's life was not traditional in many ways:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[*4,5*] 23. There is no expert evidence before me regarding marriage customs in the Tianjin region of China. I accept that the applicant is from a village and that the village is likely more traditional than a city setting. The applicant's life has been far from a traditional, village one. She studied English in Malta and has had two trips to UAE, one to work in a restaurant, the second just as a holiday visit to friends, which is far from what a traditional village person would have experienced. She has had considerable contact with the appellant and his father and communicates frequently with the appellant by email and in English and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the visa applicant process, in relation to Canada. The applicant testified that \"on average\" married couples in her area will live together continually after the marriage. Yet, the experession \"on average\" affords the possibility fo the exception to the average situation and certainly her circumstance is exceptional. The appellant has not shown that she would be substantially stigmatized by following through with the traditional marriage to a person from another country and thus being separated for a period of time from her husband while his sponsorship of her is being processed. ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "The Board recognized that the jurisprudence is clear that consummation of a marriage is not in itself an indication that the marriage is not genuine or was entered into primarily to acquire any status or privilege under the Act. At paragraphs 17 to 21, the Board considered many of the cases submitted by counsel for the applicant in favour of this position. The Board found, however, that none of those cases prevented the Board from considering the consummation of the applicants' marriage as one factor in its consideration of their marriage:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[*4,5*] 18. Sexual relations between husband and wife are but one indicator of the genuineness of a marriage, not a precondition to a finding of genuineness and like all other indicators, the degree or existence of one factor does not preclude the finding that a marriage is genuine.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[*4,5*] 20. I accept that how exactly a marriage will manifest itself, varies from culture to culture and even within one culture depending on the personalities of the individuals involved. However, the nature of interpersonal relations between spouses, including the existence or not of sexual relations is a factor to be considered in determining whether a marriage is genuine.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "In this case, the Board found that the applicants were, in fact, waiting for the female applicant to obtain a visa before they would truly be married.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[*4,5*] 22. It is unusual for a couple to marry and not consummate their marriage. Indeed, the applicant acknowledged that it is a rarity in her region for husbands and wives not to marry and then live together. It is evidence from what the appellant and the applicant told the visa officer that they only intended to have the traditional wedding ceremony after the applicant obtained her visa. According to the appellant, the applicant was the first person to tell him that she could not have sexual relations with him until there was both a traditional wedding ceremony and she could live with him, in essence until she was sponsored to Canada. ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "Moreover, the Board found that the applicants should not have been prevented from living together, because the male applicant could have moved to China. Indeed, the Board recognized that the male applicant had testified that he would do that should the female applicant fail to obtain a visa to Canada:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[*4,5*] 23. ...According to the testimony before me, the appellant intends to travel to China in March 2011, regardless of the outcome of these proceedings and if the applicant is not granted a visa he will live with her in China, while reapplying. According to the appellant he has clear title to his home, which is worth a substantial amount of money. Given that he has been unemployed for the past two years, the option of living for a significant time in China with the applicant, was available to him. ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[29]", "As a result of these factors, the Board held that it was not satisfied that the marriage had been entered into in good faith:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[*4,5*] 23. ... On the whole of the evidence before me, the fact that the appellant and the applicant have not celebrated their marriage in the traditional fashion and consummated their marriage undermines both the claim that the marriage is genuine and that it was not primarily entered into in order to acquire any status or privilege under the", "Act", ".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "Finally, the Board stated that the applicants' credibility was undermined by their history of \"false information presented to the visa office, in relation to the temporary visa applications\" and so the Board could not rely purely on their testimony of their love in order to find good faith:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[*4,5*] 24. ...Given the appellant's involvement with false information presented to the visa office, in relation to the temporary visa applications, the appellant has not exhibited a degree of credibility that permits a conclusion that he is genuinely committed to this marriage. I simply do not know if he is head over heals in love, believing everything the applicant tells him, or whether he is involved in yet another fraudulent visa application. The applicant is far from the shy, traditional village woman that she has been portrayed as. She has extensively studied, worked and travelled for pleasure abroad. She has over three years of post secondary education and works as a chemistry lab technician.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "In the result, the Board concluded that the applicants had failed to meet their burden of proof:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[*4,5*] 25.

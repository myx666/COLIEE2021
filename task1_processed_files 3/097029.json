It should only be where unreasonable omissions are made, for example where an investigator failed to investigate obviously crucial evidence, that judicial review is warranted.\"."], ["[28]", "In this case, the applicant casts doubt on the neutrality and thoroughness of the investigation conducted by the Commission's investigator. However, after reviewing the matter, the Court is not convinced that the applicant's arguments are well-founded and cannot accept her claims."], ["[29]", "First, with regard to the issue of procedural fairness, the Court feels that each of the parties had numerous opportunities to submit their observations and make their arguments regarding the allegations of discrimination and harassment put forth by the applicant. The Court notes that the applicant submitted her observations to the Commission on December 5, 2009 and on January 20, 2010. Similarly, the respondent submitted its comments on December 15, 2009 and on January 29, 2010. After receiving the investigation report, the applicant was given an opportunity to contact the Commission on May 11, 2011. She then submitted her comments with respect to the investigation report to the investigator. In addition, the applicant's witness, Ms. Bouchard, signed a letter with her comments which was sent to the Commission. All in all, the Court finds that the applicant was provided with several opportunities to participate in the decision-making process and, consequently, the Court cannot conclude that there was any lack of procedural fairness."], ["[30]", "Second, as for the issue of neutrality and thoroughness, the applicant's arguments must also be dismissed."], ["[31]", "The evidence in fact shows that the investigator interviewed the applicant and the witnesses proposed by her, specifically Murielle Bouchard and Joseph Sohmer.

Although the applicant criticizes the investigator for having preferred Ms. Ouellette's version of the events surrounding her grievance, the Court cannot conclude that this adversely affected the neutrality and thoroughness of the process. The Court reiterates that it is up to the investigator and the Commission to assess the probative value of the evidence and to draw conclusions from it. In this case, the applicant criticizes the Commission for having preferred some evidence over other evidence. In this context, the Court adopts the comments offered by Justice Harrington in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 56: \"[i]n any event, most of the commentary was argumentative and urged the investigator to prefer one body of evidence over the other. It is not the function of the investigator, or the Commission, to make credibility determinations, but rather only to determine whether or not there is evidence which, if believed, would justify the complaint.\"."], ["[32]", "Thus, the Court finds that the investigator did not selectively analyse the evidence and did not fail to investigate obviously crucial evidence. Most of the applicant's arguments were centred on the handling of her grievance by the union and the CIRB as well as the evidence submitted in this context, specifically the union sheets. However, the Court notes that it cannot re-examine this process in terms of the labour law and that the only issue before it is the judicial review of the Commission's decision. The Court further notes that the CIRB's decision was not challenged by the applicant and that it was therefore reasonable in the circumstances for the investigator to accept some of the related evidence and documentation."], ["[33]", "Lastly, it is important to emphasize that the Commission's mandate was to determine whether there was evidence that would allow it to conclude that the applicant had suffered harassment or discrimination in the course of her employment on account of her national or ethnic origin and whether her not having been rehired was the accumulation of this harassment and discrimination. Essentially, the investigator determined that the evidence adduced did not support the allegations of harassment and discrimination on the basis of the applicant's national or ethnic origin."], ["[34]", "The investigator made the observation that the applicant had been unable to provide names and/or specific details regarding the allegations. The investigator also concluded that Ms. Bouchard, one of the applicant's witnesses, had raised one single comment as evidence of harassment, but that Ms. Bouchard admitted that she did not know the context in which the comment was made. The investigator further observed that neither Ms. Bouchard nor Mr. Sohmer were able to show that the applicant had been the victim of harassment or discrimination on account of her national or ethnic origin. Rather, the investigator found that the applicant had shown that she had performance difficulties as an employee of the respondent. The applicant has not convinced the Court that the Commission's findings were unreasonable."], ["[35]", "The Court sympathises with the applicant's situation, but, in light of the arguments of the parties, the evidence in the record and the parameters established by the jurisprudence, the Court is of the view that the Commission's decision is reasonable. The investigation was conducted in a fair, neutral and impartial manner and the investigator drew reasonable conclusions. Consequently, the Court is of the view that it was reasonable for the Commission to have adopted the investigator's recommendations and to have dismissed the applicant's complaint ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 28;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2005] FCJ No 2056)."], ["[36]", "For all of these reasons, the application for judicial review will be dismissed.

Whatever be the meaning of the qualifying term 'beneficial', the word owner can only normally be used in reference to title in the res itself, a title characterized essentially by the right to dispose of the res. The French corresponding word 'propriétaire' is equally clear in that regard. These words are clearly inapt to describe the possession of a demise charterer. In my view, the expression 'beneficial owner' was chosen to serve as an instruction, in a system of registration of ownership rights, to look beyond the register in searching for the relevant person. But such search cannot go so far as to encompass a demise charterer who has no equitable or proprietary interest which could burden the title of the registered owner. As I see it, the expression 'beneficial owner' serves to include someone who stands behind the registered owner in situations where the latter functions merely as an intermediary, like a trustee, a legal representative or an agent.

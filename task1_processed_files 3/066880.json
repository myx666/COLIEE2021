On April 28, 2014, the Respondents advised Citizenship and Immigration Canada [CIC] that they wished to make refugee claims. CIC made an appointment with the Respondents to appear for an interview for that purpose on May 6, 2014. The CIC officer who took their applications for protection determined that they were eligible to make a claim for inland refugee status and transmitted their applications to the RPD where they were marked as received on May 9, 2014.

Mr. Chan conducted this interview at the request of Garett Toporowski, Minister's Representative, Inland Enforcement Section, Enforcement Intelligence Division, Pacific Region, Canada Border Services Agency. Both gentlemen worked within areas falling under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness - not the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration."], ["[4]", "After receiving the call, the Respondents attempted to contact the interpreter through whom they communicate with their lawyer, but were unable to do so. They attended the interview without their lawyer. They did not advise Mr. Chan that they wished to have their lawyer present and he did not ask them if they wished to have their lawyer present. Mr. Chan did not advise the Respondents' lawyer of the interview, although it is clear from the record that he was well aware that they had counsel."], ["[5]", "Mr. Chan questioned the Respondents on statements they made in their Basis of Claim forms regarding the factual basis on which they were seeking protection in Canada."], ["[6]", "On June 30, 2014, Mr. Toporowski filed a Notice of Intention to Intervene in the Respondents' refugee claims hearing on behalf of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. It was indicated that the intervention would be by filing documents only. In addition to two documents from third party sources, the documents filed were (i) the solemn declaration of Karl Chan setting out the questions asked and answers provided at the June 26th Interview, and (ii) a second solemn declaration of Karl Chan relating information he was given by the Spanish translator at the June 26th Interview regarding five email messages he had been shown by the Respondents, together with information he later obtained when following up on this."], ["[7]", "At the hearing on July 10, 2014, counsel for the Respondents applied to exclude from evidence the documents pertaining to the June 26th Interview. First, counsel submitted that Karl Chan lacked jurisdiction to conduct the interview.

Written submissions on the procedural challenges were provided by the Respondents and the Crown.

The hearing then proceeded on the merits."], ["[9]", "On October 31, 2014, the RPD issued its decision. The Panel found that Karl Chan had jurisdiction to conduct the June 26th Interview, and further found that Sections 15 and 16 of the", "Immigration and Refugee Protection Act", ", SC 2001, c 27 [the Act] gave Karl Chan, a CBSA Officer, jurisdiction to examine a refugee claimant at any time until their claim for protection has been determined by the RPD. The Panel further held that \"there was no obligation for the CBSA Officer to notify counsel that the interview was scheduled to occur, or to formally provide the claimants with their right to counsel.\""], ["[10]", "The RPD rejected the Respondents' refugee claims. The primary basis for the decision on the merits was credibility. In this respect the Panel noted: \"The most significant concern with the claimants' evidence on this issue was a contradiction between Ms. Paramo de Gutierrez's testimony and the answers the claimants provided during their interview with Officer Chan [i.e. the June 26th Interview].\""], ["[11]", "The Respondents appealed the RPD's decision to the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD]. The Respondents submitted that the RPD violated their rights to procedural fairness by admitting documents pertaining to the June 26th Interview which, they alleged, was unfairly and improperly conducted without notice to their counsel of record, and that, in any event, their rights to procedural fairness were breached because the officer had no jurisdiction to conduct that interview in the first place."], ["[12]", "The RAD granted the Respondents' appeal on the basis that the RPD ought to have excluded the June 26th Interview evidence because the officer had obtained that evidence in breach of the Respondents' rights to counsel.", "The Appellants had Counsel of Record from the time that the claims were submitted so any and all communications related to the claims, including to attend an interview at the CBSA, should have included the Appellants' counsel. It is well-established in law and reflected throughout the immigration-related rules, that when an individual has elected to have representation in a proceeding at the IRB and has provided contact information for that representative, all subsequent communications must be through and include that representative unless there are indications that the representation is for limited purposes, which was not the case in this claim. The requirement to communicate with Counsel was tacitly conceded by the Minister in his response to initial objection by the Appellant's Counsel by indicating that there was a general 'courtesy' of notifying counsel about CBSA interviews and that this courtesy would be extended in any similar future event. The Minister's representative attempted to distinguish between courtesy and legal requirements but that position is inconsistent with the legal principles regarding the nature of representation, which is that the representative stands in the place of the person being represented."], ["[13]", "Given its conclusion on the right to counsel, the RAD did not find it necessary to consider whether the officer had the jurisdiction to question the Respondents when he did, although it made some comments in", "obiter", "on that issue."], ["[14]", "The RAD set aside the RPD's decision and remitted the matter back to the RPD for re-determination by a different member of the Board. It further ordered that the documents pertaining to the June 26th Interview be excluded from evidence on the re-determination."], ["[15]", "Both parties agreed that the affidavit evidence filed on this application containing information not before the RAD, was not admissible. It has not been considered by the Court in rendering this decision.", "Issues"], ["[16]", "The decision under review was made on the right to counsel issue; however, the Applicant has also raised as an issue whether the RAD erred in refusing to decide whether the officer had authority to interview the Respondents after the eligibility decision had been made. At the hearing of this application, counsel for the Applicant did not reject (and in fact, accepted) the Court's suggestion that it might be appropriate to also deal with the merits of the jurisdiction issue. There is a practicality in so doing. If this review application is allowed and the RAD decision on right to counsel overturned, then it is likely that the Respondents will then ask the RAD to make a decision on the jurisdiction issue, which may then find its way to this Court. If this review is denied, the importance of the issue is such that an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal is likely, and there the jurisdiction issue will most likely be raised."], ["[17]", "In any event, the Court has had the benefit of full submissions on the jurisdiction issue and comity suggests that the RPD decision on jurisdiction will be followed by other Panels in future cases and this is very likely to lead again to future appeals to the RAD. It is also of some note that there may be others affected by the jurisdiction question and who will not have a right to appeal to the RAD. For all of these reasons, although the decision under review did not decide the jurisdiction question, I have concluded that it is important and necessary that the Court address it."], ["[18]", "In her written and oral submissions, counsel for the Respondents noted that \"the facts do not support any suggestion that the Minister had any security or criminality concerns.\" I accept that observation as accurate. Indeed, the line of questioning by Karl Chan during the June 26th interview appeared to be directed to the facts alleged by the Respondents as the basis of their claims for protection. This raises a question of why it was that CBSA officers and not CIC officers were doing the questioning in the first place."], ["[19]", "It is the Court's understanding, based on the roles of these two Ministers as set out in section 4 of the Act, that CIC intervenes in cases involving credibility or program integrity issues, while CBSA is responsible for cases involving criminality or security issues. Accordingly, one might ask whether these CBSA officers had any jurisdiction or authority to engage in the questioning or intervene at the RPD given the absence of any criminality or security concerns.

This is evident from the fact that neither of the objectives in paragraphs 3(2)(g) or (h) were engaged in the Respondents' applications for protection and not a single question was asked of them by Karl Chan that went to either objective. The RPD further notes \"the absence of any specific statutory provision outlining when the examination of a person making a refugee claim ends\" and says that it will give a \"plain reading\" to paragraph 28(d) of the Regulations, which is that a person is no longer under examination when he or she is no longer making a refugee claim, that is, when the claim is decided by the RPD."], ["[33]", "In my opinion, this is an unreasonable and frankly incorrect interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions. The Member has ignored or read out a relevant part of subsection 15(1), which gives an officer jurisdiction to conduct an examination \"if a person makes an application", "to the officer", "in accordance with this Act\" [emphasis added]. The Member correctly found that \"the Minister's jurisdiction to determine a refugee claim ends upon a determination of whether the claimant is eligible to appear before the Division for a hearing.\" On a purposive interpretation of subsection 15(1), according to which the scope of the legislative tools conferred by the Act is to be determined by reference to their ultimate function, an officer's jurisdiction to examine an individual ends once the claim has been referred to the RPD."], ["[34]", "The RPD and the Applicant suggest that an officer's jurisdiction to examine a person continues as long as that person is making a refugee claim.

It would severely impinge on the effectiveness of a refugee claimant's right to counsel if that right only allowed counsel to make submissions at a hearing itself, and provided him or her with no opportunity to participate in the fact-finding process upon which the hearing is based.

The right to retain counsel must include the right to have that counsel present during any material aspect of the proceeding and that must include any part of the proceeding that involves the gathering of information from the claimants for the purposes of the proceeding.

As a consequence, this Court will intervene only in those cases were the decision under review is patently unreasonable. This is most certainly the standard applicable with respect to the decision affecting Shirina.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "As for the decision to exclude Alamgir from the definition of \"dependant child\", it is entitled to a little less deference since the visa officer first had to conclude that the concept of \"attendance\" implies a physical presence in the classroom before determining that he was not in compliance with the definition. This is clearly a mixed question of fact and law, and as a result that decision should be assessed on the basis of the reasonableness simpliciter standard. This was indeed conceded by counsel for the defendant at the hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "After having reviewed the documentary record and a transcript of the interview, and having heard and considered the submissions, I am of the view that the decision of the visa officer should not be disturbed. Not only is her decision sound and in conformity with the legislation and the case law, but I have not been convinced that she breached a principle of natural justice in coming to her decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The Federal Court of Appeal, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 287 N.R. 97 (C.A.)), gave the following interpretation of the words \"enrolled and in attendance as a full-time student\" that were found in the definition of \"dependent son\" under the former regulations:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"In my view, the words 'enrolled and in attendance as a full-time student' require that the student, on a continuous basis, make a bona fide attempt to assimilate the material of the subjects in which the student is enrolled. This does not suggest that a student must be either successful in the examinations or that the student have acquired a mastery of the subject. What is required is a genuine effort on the part of the student to acquire the knowledge that the course seeks to impart. Thus a visa officer is required to consider more than mere physical attendance in determining whether the person has been 'in attendance as a full-time student' and must make sufficient inquiries in order to satisfy himself that the student meets the requirements of subparagraph 2(1)(b)(i). <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "Justice Sexton, speaking for the court in that case, then went on with a series of factors that can be considered in making such a determination. What clearly emerges from that decision is that as difficult as it may sometimes be to determine whether a person is a bona fide student, it will at the very least be essential to show a regular physical attendance to the various courses required by the academic program in which that person is enrolled. More may be required to demonstrate a real commitment to a course of studies, but going to classes will in all cases be the bare minimum.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "It is worth noting that the wording used in the definition of \"dependant child\" in the current", "Regulations", "appears to express the intent to codify the factors spelled out by the Court of Appeal in the", "Sandhu", "decision.

The officer could certainly come to the conclusion that Shirina was not continuously enrolled in and attending a post-secondary institution since she turned 22, considering the two periods during which she was not a full-time student. As for Alamgir, he certainly could not claim that he was \"attending\" school if he was studying from home (it is worth noting that he appears to have failed his final master degree exam; although this is not, in and of itself, a determining factor, it can certainly be taken into account in assessing the genuineness of his commitment).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "As for the alleged breach of the duty of fairness and the visa officer's failure to give the applicant and the dependants an opportunity to provide additional information with respect to their status as full-time students, I can find no merit with this argument. It is true that the visa officer took into consideration an email that was sent to her by a Migration Integrity Officer, who reported after having visited the institutions where the dependants were enrolled that Alamgir was a \"private student\" and did not attend classes, and that Shirina had indeed two gaps in her academic curriculum. But this did not amount to the breach of a principle of natural justice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "It is clearly established that it falls upon the Applicants to prove that the children were indeed \"dependant childs\" and satisfied the definition found in the Regulation. As such, it was the responsibility of the Applicants to provide the Visa Officer with all the information necessary to assess their application. There is no requirement for a visa officer to seek clarification, or to reach out and make the Applicant's case (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "Relying on", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 151 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.), the Applicant contended that they should have been given the opportunity to alleviate the Visa Officer's concerns stemming from the email. In that case, my colleague Justice Teitelbaum did mention that the visa officer should inform the applicant of his concerns when he has obtained extrinsic evidence. But he then goes on to add:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"In essence, where an interview is necessary to assess an applicant, the duty of fairness requires that the visa officer thoroughly interview the applicant on factors relevant to the claim and give the applicant an opportunity to respond to allegations or assumptions of which the applicant could not be reasonably aware. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "In the present case, the Visa Officer interviewed Shirina and Alamgir and reviewed their academic records. The documentary evidence before the Visa Officer did not show that they had continuous enrolment or attendance in school. Of course, the Visa Officer then asked for a verification of the documents that they had provided. But her decision was not based upon the discovery of any new facts; it is not as if she had received, subsequently to the interview, information that the diplomas or the records were false. All the information that she used to reach her conclusion was within the alleged defendants' knowledge. In the circumstances of this case, I find that a sufficient opportunity was given to Shirina and Alamgir during their interview to enable them to meet the onus they faced to demonstrate that they met the selection standards.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "In the result, the application for judicial review is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Application dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Editor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/gs  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[End of document]"]]}

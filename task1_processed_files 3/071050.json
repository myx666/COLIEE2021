The Rule quoted illustrates the conflict early recognized by the Courts before the subject-matter came under legislation, i.e., between the appropriation by a trader of a word within the range of language that would ordinarily be used by traders to describe particular goods, and the right of other traders in the normal carrying on of their business to employ the same or similar words.

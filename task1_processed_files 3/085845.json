On July 14, 2004, he pled guilty to fraud over $5,000 and failing to comply with recognizance. On December 9, 2005 he was convicted of personating with intent in a matter dealing with a mortgage application. On April 5, 2007, he pled guilty to uttering a false document, fraud under $5,000, breach of probation, unauthorized use of credit card data, possession over $5,000 and unlawfully possessing a counterfeit mark.

The Officer's conclusion on this point appears reasonable particularly given that Officer's discretion does not duplicate the role of the PRRA or H&C Officer. The fact that better care would be available in Canada is not a ground for deferral. The issue of discrimination or stigma that the applicant may face due to his HIV status in Zimbabwe is also not a ground for deferral and is outside the scope of an Enforcement Officer."], ["[15]", "The Officer noted that the applicant's children are under the care of their mother and the supervision of the Children's Aid Society by Order of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

Hence, removal of the applicant would essentially maintain the status quo as the children would continue to remain in Canada under the care of their mother with support, as held necessary, by the Children's Aid Society. Therefore the Officer made no error in concluding that the immediate interest of the children will continue to be looked after if the applicant were to be removed from Canada. The status quo would continue and the children would remain in Canada with their mother, or in the custody of the state until otherwise decided."], ["[17]", "The applicant raises concerns that his wife and three oldest children also have removal orders.

The applicant had claimed that he had not filed the forms and paid the fee as he was dealing with his criminal charges and the difficulty in saving the money to pay for the fee. But there is no merit to the argument that the applicant's criminal charges explain a two-year delay. The Court also notes that the record indicates that the Applicant was able to procure $2,500 on June 29, 2006 as a bond for his release after he was arrested on an immigration warrant two weeks earlier."], ["[20]", "A late filed H&C application does not warrant a deferral even if there is a backlog in processing those applications.

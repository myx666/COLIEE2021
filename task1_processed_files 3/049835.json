Contrary to the situation in", "Reference Re: Anti-Inflation Act", ", cited above, in the present instance, it is clear that the reference to provincial standards constitutes an exercise of federal jurisdiction to fund welfare on reserves on a basis that recipients will be treated on a comparable basis to welfare recipients living off reserve in the same province. While it imports eligibility standards and rates set by the provinces, it does not purport to abnegate the federal government's jurisdiction over Indians under the", "Constitution Act", ", 1867."], ["[89]", "Secondly, the Court also rejects the Applicants' argument that the Minister fettered his discretion because the National Manual (2012) did retain the reasonably comparable criteria."], ["[90]", "In order to narrow the issue, the Court also finds that, in terms of its eligibility for assistance requirements, the Etpiiteneoei Manual was not comparable with the eligibility requirements in New Brunswick. The National Manual (2012) attempts to realign the eligibility requirements with those of the provinces though it specifies that they must be \"reasonably comparable\" in one section and imposes strict adherence in another. The question is whether the mirroring of provincial rates and eligibility criteria will result in recipients on reserves receiving less financial assistance than individuals eligible under the provincial welfare systems."], ["[91]", "The Applicants argue that there will be significant discrepancies because, when setting assistance rates in their social assistance programs, the provinces have now taken a more comprehensive approach and take into account other subsidies, services and programs they are providing to social welfare recipients which are complementary to these schemes but do no qualify as social benefits. The only evidence before the Court as to the extent of these discrepancies, is the letter sent by the assembly of First Chiefs in New Brunswick to the Minister of AANDC in April 2011 identifying 29 programs in New Brunswick that supplement the basic rate (these programs were listed above in paragraph 46) and the findings of Dr Wien in paragraph 48 above."], ["[92]", "The Court notes that AANDC did, in fact, review the list and came to the conclusion that for: \"the majority of these programs [they] were able to clearly identify what the comparable benefit would be, so it either was something [they] could deliver through income assistance, such as the fuel supplement, or it was something clearly delivered through another program\" (see Cross-Examination of Barbara Robinson, JAR, volume 6, p 2271, lines 11 to 16). On the same topic, Ms. Robinson testified as follows:", "\"Well one of the things that we were certainly aware of when this letter was sent in to the minister is that there are a number of benefits listed on this list which either are eligible under income assistance- and the assumption was made they are not- or they're benefits that Canada delivers through another mechanism ... \"Health services\", there are a number of items here, so the dental program, the allergy serum, a hearing aid, these are all things that can be provided through Health Canada's non-insured health benefits.\"(see JAR, volume 6, p 2266, lines 18 to 25 and p 2267, lines 1 to 4)."], ["[93]", "On the basis of Ms. Robinson's testimony and the fact that AANDC's conclusion was communicated verbally at the May 19th, 2011 meeting with Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nations, the Court is satisfied that, for a majority of the programs listed, either they are delivered by the federal government through Canada's non-insured benefits, or are eligible under income assistance or, finally, they can be accessed directly by residents on reserves (vocational training etc.) In sum, a comparable level of benefits is offered though not necessarily an identical level."], ["[94]", "The evidence in the record indicates that while only 30% of the basic rate is designated for housing costs in New Brunswick, the province also provides a shelter subsidy covering 70% of the remaining shelter costs. As the Applicants explain:", "\"Most social assistance recipients on reserves live in Band-owned housing financed under loan agreements between the First Nation and Canada Mortgage and Housing (\"CMHC\"), pursuant to s. 95 of the", "National Housing Act", ", RSC 1985, c N-11. Pursuant to these agreements, the loans from CMHC to build each home are to be repaid through the occupiers' social assistance payments. CMHC loan repayments can be in the range of $500-600 per month on reserves in New Brunswick. . . . Therefore, if a person on reserve is receiving New Brunswick's basic Schedule B amount of $827, after paying their rent, the individual will be left with only $200-300 for utilities, food, transport, and personal need items for the entire month\" (Applicants' Memorandum, para 55)."], ["[95]", "As noted above, the majority of First Nations in the Maritime provinces have entered into AFAs with Aboriginal Affairs (currently 27 out of 30 bands). Previous AFAs allowed First Nations to move surplus funds from one program to another. The Applicants submit that this is no longer available to them:. \"If providing an additional shelter supplement beyond the basic rate is not permitted under the delivery standards for the social assistance program pursuant to the Decision, then doing so under a social housing scheme developed under the capital program would be similarly prohibited\" (Applicants' Memorandum, para 65)."], ["[96]", "Ms. Robinson, when questioned on that issue by Applicants' counsel, clearly stated (at p 2231, JAR, volume 6, lines 13 to 22) that:", "\". . . I believe that the mechanism to support that within the Funding Agreement is there because within the Block-Funding Agreement, of course, if you generate surpluses under one Block-Funded Program, you can transfer those to eligible expenditures under another. So if you're reducing the overall amount that you're paying out under income assistance, because you're not paying actuals for rent and utilities anymore, those surpluses can be transferred to the Capital Program to pay for subsidized housing or the service of mortgages.\""], ["[97]", "This being the case, the shelter expenses issue described above is not so crucial (at least for the vast majority of First Nations who are under AFAs). With respect to the New Brunswick First Nations under CFAs, the evidence in the record is to the effect that AANDC has made a commitment that, whatever difference in costs arises out of moving to provincial rates, the difference will be retained in a reserve for the use of that band (see Cross-Examination of Barbara Robinson, JAR, volume 6, p 2244, lines 10 to 18)."], ["[98]", "First Nations will be able to transfer the savings arising from the implementation of provincial rates to their social assistance program into newly developed housing assistance programs under which they could reduce an income recipient's housing costs. According to the Associate Regional Director General of the Atlantic Region of AANDC, Dougal MacDonald, the new funding agreements will require First Nations to seek pre-approval for any use of surplus funds. The wording of the new agreements mandates approval from AANDC for the transfer of surplus funds to a housing assistance program (see JAR, volume 6, tab 9, p 2147). There is no evidence that such approval will not be granted."], ["[99]", "The Applicants have also offered evidence showing a significant discrepancy between what recipients will be receiving in Nova Scotia versus what they are currently receiving as a result of the implementation of the change in policy. The Court finds that part of that significant difference relates to shelter and mortgage payments and can be addressed as indicated above. There is, nonetheless, a significant difference arising out of the child welfare supplement that current recipients on reserves would be losing according to Dr. Wien's evidence. Ms. Robinson testified that: \"However, families do continue to receive the full National Child Benefit and they also receive something called the Nova Scotia Child Benefit, and the amount of money that families would receive in those combined child benefits is greater than what would have been provided to meet children's basic needs under the old 1991 manual\" (see JAR, volume 6, p 2378, lines 8 to 13)."], ["[100]", "There are two other areas that were raised by the Applicants; these are the diet supplements and the funding for utilities. The Court acknowledges that the implementation of a mirroring of provincial rates will definitely impact the welfare recipients living on reserves who require a special diet. The data before the Court do not provide any evidence as to the number of recipients who will be affected, but the shortfall in the monthly allowance will be $16 a month in New Brunswick (see JAR, volume 6, Cross-Examination of Barbara Robinson, p 2255, lines 6 to 12). The Court also notes that the allowance for special pre- and post-natal diets and formulas will also be capped at $40 per month in New Brunswick (see JAR, volume 6, p 2257, lines 16 to 18). Ms. Robinson stated the following (see JAR, volume 6, p 2188, lines 6 to 15): \"And, in the Province of New Brunswick, they have a flat-rate special diet, now. So, in most cases, the special diet amount in the Province of New Brunswick would be less than what clients had been receiving, but not in all cases\"."], ["[101]", "As to the utilities, the evidence in the record points to the existence of measures in the New Brunswick provincial rates such as the one time $550 supplement on top of the basic rate of $250 payable from November to April and $100 for the rest of the year (see JAR, volume 6, p 2249, lines 8 to 16) that can partially offset the current practice of certain First Nations to pay actual costs."], ["[102]", "Finally with respect to the Applicants' contention that bands would not be able to access the provincial manuals online, Ms Barbara J. Robinson testified that it is, in fact, available online and that provincial officials had made a presentation to the First Nations attendees as to how to access the provincial manual online (see JAR, volume 6, Cross-Examination of Barbara Robinson at p 2297) and, more importantly, that funding is available as part of service delivery to purchase off -the-shelf case management software programs (see JAR, volume 6, Cross-Examination of Barbara Robinson, p 2309, lines 2 to 5)."], ["[103]", "Beyond the funding agreements, the evidence before the Court indicates that Aboriginal Affairs intend to direct most unexpended funds into active measures programs which would provide for services such as employment training (see JAR, volume 5, tab 62, p 1785). While it can be argued that directing the unexpended funds to employment training will also meet one of the objectives set by the MOU that is reduced dependency rates and greater self reliance, it is also important to underline that the priority set by the MOU is equal treatment with citizens living off reserves."], ["[104]", "When Barbara J. Robinson, the Manager of Social Programs, was questioned on the impact of moving to a mirroring of provincial rates, she explained that AANDC could not determine the impact of the move to strict adherence to provincial rates on every individual recipient but overall", "\". . . if you include all the benefits currently provided, so that would be shelter costs, including utilities, plus the personal allowances, in most cases the current Atlantic Regional Manual would provide a higher dollar amount of assistance per client than the provincial rate structure would, ... [N]ot to say in every case, but in the majority of cases\" (see Cross-Examination of Barbara Robinson, JAR, volume 6, p 2187, lines 11 to 19)."], ["[105]", "Providing rates identical to those offered in the reference provinces would, in our view, certainly comply with a literal reading of \"consistent\" used in the MOU, it would also be \"comparable\" because, as the evidence indicates, a majority of First Nations recipients will see decreases in the amount of revenues they will be receiving, but the overall amount of funding to their respective communities will remain constant. As First Nations have the flexibility to demise programs to lessen the impact of the strict application of provincial rates, the Court finds that the change in policy intended to be implemented through the National Manual (2012) conforms to the Treasury Board's MOU that specifies that First Nation social assistance recipients receive the same level of benefits as other provincial residents."], ["[106]", "It is the Court's opinion that the true significance of the change in policy will affect eligibility.

The only document of record was presented by the Applicants at para 68 of their memorandum.

It is not reasonable, however, because there is no data on the number of recipients who will loose their benefits as a result of the application of provincial eligibility criteria. The Minister failed to obtain data on the impact the strict application of provincial eligibility criteria would have on recipients, this omission renders his decision unreasonable (see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ])."], ["[114]", "The Court also notes that the language used in the Manual (2012) departs somewhat from the wording in the MOU as it relates to standards applicable to programs in that the concept of reasonable comparability has been retained.

In the Respondent's view, the additional evidence submitted by the Applicant confirmed rather than contradicted the Board's findings. The Respondent contends that the updated September 2008 audiogram is consistent with the earlier audiogram which established a disabling hearing loss as of December 2007. As for the letter from Dr. Longridge (page 132 of the Applicant's Record), the Respondent argues that it is consistent with the Board's finding that the Applicant's current hearing loss condition is not entirely attributable to military-related noise exposure."], ["[18]", "The Respondent highlights that the Policy acknowledges that for some physical acts such as hearing, there will be a range of what is considered to be normal. Where it is established that an applicant's hearing falls outside the defined range, the extent of the loss is rated as either disabling hearing loss or lesser degree of hearing. The Respondent holds that the question of whether an applicant has a hearing loss disability is governed by the definition of \"disability\" in section 3(1) of the", "Pension", "Act", ".

The Policy establishes normal hearing as being where there is a decibel loss of 25 dB or less at all frequencies between 250 and 8000 hertz (page 2). A disabling hearing loss is \"when there is a Decibel Sum Hearing Loss (DSHL) 100 dB or greater at frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz in either ear, or 50 dB or more in both ears at 4000 Hz\" (page 2). Whereas a lesser degree of hearing exists where the decibel loss is \"greater than 25 dB at frequencies between 250 and 8000 hertz, and this loss is not sufficient to meet VAC's definition of disabling hearing loss\" (page 2). Partial entitlement will be awarded where a disabling hearing loss is not entirely attributable to military service. The Policy provides that \"[a] disabling hearing loss can be considered to be partially caused by service factors, when there is decibel loss greater than 25 dB evident on the discharge audiogram in at least one of the frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz; and a disabling hearing loss is established after discharge\" (page 2). The presence of a hearing loss and the type of hearing loss may be determined from an audiogram. The Policy further provides the cause of the hearing loss cannot be determined from an audiogram alone. The history from the patient, the physical examination and relevant test results must be considered along with the audiogram findings (page 2)."], ["[25]", "In the case at bar, it is well accepted that the Applicant has a disability, the dispute arises from the assessment of the pension determined in accordance. The one-fifth entitlement stems from the fact that it has been determined that the Applicant did not have a disabling hearing loss at the time of discharge, as demonstrated by the 1992 audiogram, and the disabling hearing loss was only established in 2007 (Applicant's Record at page 71)."], ["[26]", "The Applicant submits that he provided new evidence to the Board which shows that his disabling hearing loss is directly linked to his military service and reasons that he is entitled to an increased pension. Each party has presented their own interpretation of this medical evidence, however, I would specify that it is not the role of this Court to interpret the evidence in relation to the claim, but rather to review whether or not the Board erred by not referring to it.

The letter contains the following statement:", "\"[...] Hearing is at a mild to moderate sensorineural loss in the high tones. He has a history of noise exposure in the military, had never done anything significant in the way of noise exposure since, so the changes are the progressive effect of his existing sensorineural damage. The beginning of aging hearing loss is probably compounded by the already existing noise damage from noise.\" (Applicant's Record, page 132)"], ["[29]", "As explained above, the Policy provides for a partial entitlement in cases where disabling hearing loss is not present at the time of discharge, but manifests itself later on. It also provides that the cause of hearing loss cannot be determined by audiogram alone, but should also include the patient's history and other information. Here we have medical evidence advancing the opinion that the Applicant's current state of hearing loss is a progression of the effects caused by earlier damage and that he has lived a relatively noise-free life since his discharge. In light of the Policy, this evidence should have been analysed by the Board in reaching its decision as to whether or not the evidence justified an increase in the Applicant's pension entitlement and a departure from the Policy.

In setting out such a standard, the Policy does not set out a different or contrary definition of disability. Rather, it defines a range for normal hearing which is necessary to show that there has been a loss or a lessening of it and thus, a disability which entitles an applicant to a pension.

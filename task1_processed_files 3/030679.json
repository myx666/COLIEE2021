However, it appears that you do not qualify for this job offer because you do not meet its language requirement: The arranged employment opinion #7225456 specifies that both oral and written English as requirement. However, your IELTS score indicates that you have no proficiency in speaking, listening, and writing, and only basic proficiency in reading of English. Therefore, you do not warrant any points for arranged employment in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "The applicant was given 30 days to respond to the visa officer's concerns.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "In a letter dated June 18, 2007, the applicant responded to the letter, stating that while the visa officer's concerns were \"understandable,\" she nevertheless believed that she was \"capable of teaching within an English speaking community.\" In a letter dated June 19, 2007, the principal at the school, Irwin Diamond, also addressed the visa officer's letter by explaining why he extended the offer of employment to the applicant despite her demonstrated lack of proficiency in English. In the letter, Mr. Diamond stated that the applicant possessed \"all the fundamental skills necessary to make [her] an excellent addition to Cambridge's diverse community,\" and stated a belief that the applicant's English would be \"sufficiently improved\" by the time she began teaching.

Overall, she left our meeting having made a strong impression, convincing me of her ability in teaching the subject and desire to learn the language and customs of Canadian society; in this case, both parties of students and teacher, will benefit from the experience ... therefore I am certain her English will be sufficiently improved by the time she begins instruction at our school. ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "On July 3, 2007, the visa officer considered the submissions from both the applicant and Mr. Diamond.

This Court has consistently held that the particular expertise of visa officers dictates a deferential approach when reviewing their decisions.

To the extent that this assessment has been done in good faith, in accordance with the principles of natural justice applicable, and without relying on irrelevant or extraneous considerations, the decision of the visa officer should be reviewed on the standard of patent unreasonableness ....  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "However, in light of the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] S.C.J.

The section has been attached to the end of this decision as Appendix \"A. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "ANALYSIS  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Issue:", "Did the visa officer err", "in concluding that the points awarded were a sufficient indicator of the applicant's ability to become economically established in Canada?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "Under subsection 76(3) of the Regulations, a visa officer may substitute the points assessment with his or her own evaluation of an applicant's likelihood of becoming economically established in Canada.

Rather, the applicant argues that the visa officer was unreasonable in refusing to exercise positive discretion given the evidence before him.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "In arguing that it was unreasonable for the visa officer to refuse to exercise positive discretion under subsection 76(3), the applicant relies on two facts contained within her application for permanent residence: 1) that she possessed an offer of employment validated by Service Canada; and 2) that she had settlement funds totalling approximately CDN $699,000. According to the applicant, these facts demonstrate the unreasonableness of the visa officer's refusal, since it would be \"impossible for a reasonable person to conclude that a person arriving in Canada with $699,000 and an offer of employment will not be able to become 'economically established in Canada'. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "With respect to the applicant's offer of employment, while the offer was validated by Service Canada in an \"Arranged Employment Opinion Confirmation\" dated April 19, 2007, the visa officer was clear in stating that no points were awarded for arranged employment because the applicant did not meet the language requirements of the position. However, the visa officer did not give any weight to the principal's letter dated June 19, 2007, which assured the visa officer that the applicant would be able to fulfill the requirements of the job and that her English ability would soon rise to the requirements of the job. In the Court's view, it was unreasonable for the visa officer not to give this letter some weight as a sufficient indicator of the applicant's ability to perform this job to the satisfaction of the principal of the school. This was a factor that the visa officer did not consider in deciding whether to substitute his evaluation for the likelihood of the applicant becoming economically established in Canada. In fact, this is a letter from the school's principal stating that, having met personally with the applicant, he was confident that her English would be satisfactory by the time she began teaching. Further, the letter stated that the school very much wants to hire the applicant as a music teacher.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "In relation to the settlement funds possessed by the applicant, this Court has concluded that a visa officer can consider settlement funds when deciding whether to exercise positive discretion under subsection 76(3): see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm.

Such a restrictive reading does not make sense.

I note that the principal of the school has personally met with the applicant to make this assessment. The applicant has $699,000 to bring to Canada to become established, to which no reference was made by the visa officer. The Court concludes that the decision under subsection 76(3) of the Regulations was not reasonable since that decision gave no weight to the strong letter from the school or to the $699,000 that the applicant would bring to establish herself in Canada.

The Defendant's product at issue is STELARA; the Plaintiffs sell a product called HUMIRA. Biologic agents came on the market in the last decade. Approved for use in Canada in the treatment of psoriasis are four such products: HUMIRA, STELARA, REMICADE (also sold by Janssen), and ENBREL (sold by a company known as Amgen). Three of those products; ENBREC, HUMIRA and STELARA, are administered by subcutaneous injection, which can often be done by the patient. The fourth, REMICADE, is administered by intravenous infusion. Of these four products, three operate by targeting the body's tumor necrosis factor alpha, usually stated as TNF-, or simply, TNF. Those three are REMICADE, ENBREL and HUMIRA. Only the fourth, STELARA, operates by inhibiting IL-12."], ["[22]", "In cross-examination, Dr. Lynde at Volume 1, pages 144 and 145, estimated that the number of patients worldwide that have been on ENBREL was well over one million; that HUMIRA approaches a similar number; and that STELARA, which is relatively new on the market, is probably about eighty thousand people. At paragraph 14 of his affidavit, Dr. Lynde stated that of the five hundred to six hundred of his own patients that are treated with biologic, approximately 30% use ENBREL, 40% use HUMIRA, 25% use STELARA, and 5% use REMICADE."], ["[23]", "Dr. Shear in cross-examination, Volume 2, page 321 and 350, described that REMICADE is given in most countries in hospitals; the others by injection.

He described how, if a patient did not appear to be responding to one, the doctor may switch to another, which may include switching to STELARA. In his opinion letter (Tab C, Exhibit D-22), Dr. Shear described switching between various of these drugs and increasing dosage levels of a particular drug in order to find a drug and level that would be most effective in the treatment of a particular patient.

I have one last question which relates to the damages issues in this case.", "Can you tell the court, Mr. Manning, why isn't Abbvie willing to let Janssen continue to infringe unrestrictedly and just take a cheque now for damages?", "A. From a strictly commercial standpoint, and I know that this morning there's been a lot of talk about sales, but in my role leading the immunology division my job was to drive the profitability of my division.", "And so, what I'd like to do as a person that's driving the commercial aspect of this business, is to have the largest Humira footprint that I can possibly have and the reason for that is that I can utilize that footprint in order to negotiate with payers, with wholesalers, with other third-party providers in order to make my business more profitable.", "So just receiving a royalty cheque doesn't actually allow me to leverage to try to become a more profitable business.

That could mean a patient put on Stelara today there's a likelihood that that patient would remain on Stelara past 2020 and Abbvie would lose any benefit from that patient, where if the patient were to go on Humira today with a high likelihood that that patient remains on therapy post-2020, then we would be able to capture a benefit post the lapse of the IL-12 patent here in Canada.", "D.", "What Interests is the Defendant Seeking to Protect?"], ["[46]", "The evidence of Mr. Nitert, the Defendant's representative, shows that STELARA entered the Canadian market in 2008.

As already discussed, unlike in National Bank, supra, the employer has not been forced to state opinions (\"views and sentiments\", per Beetz J., at p. 295) which are not its own. Rather, the negative order seeks to prevent the employer from passing on an opinion, such prohibition being closely tied to the history of abuse of power which had been found to exist. Furthermore, that prohibition is very circumscribed. Firstly, it is triggered only in cases when the appellant is contacted for a reference and, secondly, there is no requirement to send the letter to anyone other then prospective employers. In sum, this is a much less intrusive and carefully designed order than that in National Bank in which the bank was required to send to a very large audience (all the employees and management staff of the bank) what amounted to a letter of contrition which conveyed the impression that certain opinions expressed therein were those of the employer."], ["[81]", "In the present case, I asked Counsel for the Plaintiffs why the Plaintiffs themselves could not communicate with doctors to present the circumstances of their victory and the terms of an injunction.

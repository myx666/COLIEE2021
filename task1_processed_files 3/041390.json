The general principle applies when the decision of the court will not have the effect of resolving some controversy which affects or may affect the rights of the parties. If the decision of the court will have no practical effect on such rights, the court will decline to decide the case. This essential ingredient must be present not only when the action or proceeding is commenced but at the time when the court is called upon to reach a decision. Accordingly if, subsequent to the initiation of the action or proceeding, events occur which affect the relationship of the parties so that no present live controversy exists which affects the rights of the parties, the case is said to be moot. The general policy or practice is enforced in moot cases unless the court exercises its discretion to depart from its policy or practice. The relevant factors relating to the exercise of the court's discretion are discussed hereinafter.", "The approach in recent cases involves a two step analysis. First it is necessary to determine whether the required tangible and concrete dispute has disappeared and the issues have become academic. Second, if the response to the first question is affirmative, it is necessary to decide if the court should exercise its discretion to hear the case. The cases do not always make it clear whether the term \"moot\" applies to cases that do not present a concrete controversy or whether the term applies only to such of those cases as the court declines to hear. In the interest of clarity, I consider that a case is moot if it fails to meet the \"live controversy\" test.

In my respectful opinion, there are two issues to contemplate in this regard. Firstly, would a Court's decision overturning the Registrar's refusal to accept the appellant's opposition to the Respondent registering the trade-mark prevent Woodbridge from using the trade-mark?

Indeed, the idea that the Registrar's decision will prejudice Dura in respect to its DURA marks in the future, is highly suspect. Dura presumes that the decision it appeals is in some way determinative of future rights or prejudicial as a precedence in subsequent applications or oppositions, whereas, I think it is proper to presume that the Registrar would consider any future applications or oppositions on the particular merits and in accordance with the Act.

The Judge is therefore obliged to raise matters favourable to the respondent and unfavourable to the appellant requiring counsel for the appellant to meet the matters so raised by the Judge, as is the duty of the Judge to do so. To place the Judge in the position in which he is required to do this is almost tantamount to making him counsel for the respondent and that is why I have termed the position into which I was forced by the respondent's decision not to be represented as 'invidious'.\""], ["[36]", "The record in this case is large and the case is of some complexity.

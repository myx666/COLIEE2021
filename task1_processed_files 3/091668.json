Whether the threatening letter found on December 4, 2000 was written before or after the plaintiff began his statutory release makes little difference, as does the fact that the letter was never mailed. It should also be noted in this regard that the evidence showed that after the documents were discovered in the plaintiff's room he allegedly told the director of the residence to which he was assigned that he intended to send the threats when the term he was currently serving expired, which in my opinion itself constituted conduct tending to further support the Board's conclusion ... It was not patently unreasonable for the Board to consider this relevant evidence as a whole in arriving at its decision. Concluding that [Translation] 'conduct since release' requires the commission of an act or positive action such as an assault, that would demonstrate that the risk the plaintiff would reoffend before expiry of the sentence he was serving had become an undue risk for society, would be to give an unduly limiting interpretation to paragraph 135(5)(a) that would frustrate the intention of Parliament.

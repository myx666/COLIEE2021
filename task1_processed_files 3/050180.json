They include allergic conjunctivitis (AC), giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), vernal conjunctivitis (VC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC). These conditions represent aberrant immune responses where the body wrongly interprets an allergen to be an invader to be destroyed or expelled."], ["[9]", "An allergic reaction in the eye is an immunological response that arises when a previously sensitized individual is exposed to an allergen or antigen. Such a person will have formed antibodies which bind to receptors on mast cells in the eye. In this way, mast cells become sensitized and, on subsequent exposure, they degranulate, a process that releases a variety of chemical mediators including histamine. These chemical mediators are the cause of the symptoms of allergy including itching, redness, swelling and watering."], ["[10]", "While other mediators are released by mast cells including several neutral proteases, chemoattractants and interleukins, it is histamine that plays a significant role in causing allergic symptoms in the eye."], ["[11]", "Histamine exerts its effects by binding to histamine receptors. An antihistamine works by binding to those receptors thereby blocking out the histamine. This is sometimes described metaphorically as putting a false key in the lock. Antihistamines are a useful form of treatment for an allergic response but they act after the mediators are released from the mast cells and they only block the effects of one mediator - histamine."], ["[12]", "Another means of treating allergic disease is by preventing the degranulation of mast cells. This is accomplished by the administration of mast cell stabilizing agents. Mast cell stabilizers (of which olopatadine is one) act by preventing mediator release from mast cells. This form of treatment blocks the release of mediators from mast cells and is not limited to the suppression of histamine. For certain diseases, a mast cell stabilizer would be expected to be more effective than an antihistamine."], ["[13]", "In 1995, cromolyn had been identified as a mast cell stabilizer in animal models but its efficacy in humans was in doubt. It was understood at that time that animal models could usefully predict the efficacy of antihistamines in humans but not the efficacy of mast cell stabilizers. The inability to predict a mast cell stabilizing effect from animal testing was understood to arise from the problem of mast cell heterogeneity, meaning that mast cells from different species and in different tissues within the same species were sufficiently different that a compound's efficacy in one would not predict efficacy in another."], ["[14]", "For several years leading up to 1995, there was a recognized need for mast cell stabilizers useful to treat some forms of allergic eye disease. In reaction to that need, Alcon initiated a search for a compound that was both a mast cell stabilizer and an antihistamine. By 1995, the 094 Patent inventors and others working in the field believed that antihistamines were unlikely to be useful as mast cell stabilizers because, in vitro and at higher concentrations, they were observed to rupture the cell causing unwanted release of mediators (the biphasic effect) - a result that was opposite to the desired stabilization effect."], ["[15]", "One of the 094 Patent inventors, Dr. John Yanni, and another colleague at Alcon developed a novel assay which was the first available method to test a drug for mast cell stabilization in the human conjunctival mast cell (the HCMC assay). The HCMC assay later formed the subject matter of a United States patent application filed on October 8, 1993."], ["[16]", "Dr. Yanni set out to test approximately 150 compounds with the HCMC assay. Many of the compounds obtained by Alcon came from other companies under transfer agreements and were known to have anti-allergic profiles. Alcon obtained olopatadine in this way from Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (Kyowa) in 1991 because it was known to be an antihistamine useful in treating allergic eye diseases in humans. Dr. Yanni understood olopatadine to be an antihistamine and was concerned that it could exhibit a biphasic effect. Upon testing olopatadine, it was discovered to have mast cell stabilizing properties at certain doses and that this response was dose dependent. At therapeutic doses, olopatadine was found not to be biphasic."], ["[17]", "In 1997, Alcon brought olopatadine to market under the trade name Patanol and this product has achieved considerable commercial success for the treatment of allergic eye diseases.", "Analysis"], ["[18]", "The outcome of this application turns on claims construction.

Alcon also argues that the use of olopatadine to treat allergic eye diseases as a mast cell stabilizer does not inherently involve treatment as an antihistamine because the dosage ranges for each method of treatment do not overlap. Using olopatadine to prophylactically treat allergic eye diseases is, therefore, distinct from its understood antihistaminic utility."], ["[37]", "Alcon similarly urges a narrow interpretation of the words \"allergic eye diseases\" which, it argues, do not include disorders that cannot be treated with a mast cell stabilizer.

Alcon argues that this unstated common feature should, accordingly, be read into the relevant claims."], ["[38]", "At the outset, it is important to recognize that nowhere in the claims is there any mention of a newly discovered and inventive use for olopatadine. There is also no reference in the claims to any particular activity or to a dual activity which might restrict the claimed use of olopatadine. While these activity profile features are described in the disclosure and quantified with respect to olopatadine's mast cell stabilizing property, those references are similarly not tied to any new form of clinical use. Indeed, the summary of the invention refers to a method for treating and not to a use. This appears to conform to the United States priority patent which claimed a method of medical treatment based on olopatadine's mast cell stabilizing properties. And despite Alcon's considerable reliance in argument on olopatadine's dual action profile and the avoidance of a biphasic effect, there is nothing in the specification to suggest that these features are part of the inventive promise of the 094 Patent."], ["[39]", "The disclosure passages Alcon relies upon also fail to clearly identify the nature or the scope of the invention. There is nothing in these passages which distinctly and explicitly identifies the subject matter of the invention whether as a new use or otherwise. While there are references to prophylactic use, dosing frequencies and demonstrated stabilization activity at specific concentrations, none of those features are clearly identified as an element of the inventive concept and none of that language is used in a way that would serve to clearly define the words in dispute in Claims 1 and 13."], ["[40]", "Furthermore, with respect to Alcon's reliance on a distinction between prophylactic and therapeutic uses, the language it has used is notably imprecise. For example, there are places in the disclosure where therapeutic and prophylactic uses for olopatadine are distinguished: therapeutic use is said to treat and prophylactic to prevent. But in other places, the word \"treating\" is used in the general sense without distinguishing the means by which the clinical outcome is achieved and \"therapeutic\" refers to a dosage (see Claim 1 and Claim 13)."], ["[41]", "This linguistic inconsistency is mirrored by the evidence. According to Alcon's own witnesses, there is no bright clinical line that ordains the use of olopatadine as a preventative therapy. [See footnote 1]"], ["[42]", "The plain reading of Claim 1 is that olopatadine can be used to treat a broader class of allergic eye diseases than the four examples provided in the disclosure and, of course, there is no express statement anywhere in the patent that the claims are limited to the treatment of disorders where mast cell degranulation is implicated. The disclosure is open-ended in that respect."], ["[43]", "The evidence from Alcon's witnesses concerning the disputed claims language is not particularly helpful because it is based on disclosure references that are not clear. Those witnesses also failed to address other disclosure references that detracted from their views and they attributed an awkward meaning to \"treating\" that seems to be more consistent with Alcon's legal interests than with the objective views of a skilled reader."], ["[44]", "Dr. Church provided the following affidavit evidence on these construction issues:", "62. What is meant by the phrase \"treating allergic eye diseases\" as used in the claims of the 094 Patent would be readily discerned by the skilled person based on a review of the 094 Patent in its entirety. As discussed earlier, page 4, lines 11-13 of the patent refers to \"treating allergic eye diseases\" in a context of helping target cells, i.e., human conjunctival mast cells. The passage states that what is needed is a drug that has demonstrated stabilizing activity on mast cells obtained from human conjunctiva, the target cells for treating allergic eye diseases. Hence, a skilled person would understand that \"treating\" involves stabilizing human conjunctival mast cells (i.e., preventing human conjunctival mast cell degranulation) to a significant level. The phrase \"allergic eye diseases\" would have been understood to mean those diseases in which conjunctival mast cell degranulation is involved, at least in part. On page 1, 11. 10-12 the patent provides some examples of such types of \"allergic eye diseases\". That passage states that \"the present invention relates to topical ophthalmic formulations used for treating allergic eye such as allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and giant papillary conjunctivitis.\" Given that a common feature of these diseases is that, as at December, l996, they were thought to have mast cell degranulation as all or part of the disease state, the skilled person would have construed \"allergic eye disease\" to mean diseases in which mast cell degranulation is involved.", "63. While some of the diseases referred to as \"allergic eye diseases\" would not be \"cured\" by mast cell stabilization, the skilled person would nonetheless appreciate that the diseases would be \"treated\" (perhaps even as an adjunct therapy) by mast cell stabilization.", "64. The \"treatment\" by stabilizing human conjunctival mast cells would have been understood by the skilled person to be an added activity over the previously known antihistaminic activity of Compound A. Hence the skilled person would understand that the word \"treating\" in the phrase \"treating allergic eye diseases\" means prophylactically and/or therapeutically treating allergic eye diseases in humans by stabilizing human conjunctival mast cells in a manner that is significant in addition to having antihistaminic activity. The inventive concept of the claims is that Compound A can be used topically at clinically relevant concentrations to prevent histamine release from the mast cells in human conjunctiva in addition to its known antihistaminic activity.", "See also Affidavit of Martin K. Church, Ph.D., D.Sc. (31 May 2011) at paras 5-7: Affidavit of Phil Lieberman (19 January 2011) at paras 81, 83, 92 [Affidavit of Dr. Lieberman].", "Dr. Lieberman's affidavit addresses the same point at paragraph 172:", "172. At paragraphs 78, 79 and 85 of his affidavit, Dr. Buckley suggests the 094 Patent describes a mechanism of action for olopatadine rather than a new use. I disagree. The use claimed in the 094 Patent is a new use, because it was never used before to treat human eye allergy or as a human conjunctival mast cell stabilizer. \"Treating\" as used in the claims, means apart from being an anti-histamine, also being a significant conjunctival mast cell stabilizer.", "Affidavit of Dr. Lieberman at para 172."], ["[45]", "This evidence equates the word \"treating\" with the way in which olopatadine works (eg. \"helping target cells\", \"'treating' involves stabilizing human conjunctival mast cells\", \"'treated' by ...mast cell stabilization\"). Except for a reference to a possible use as a prophylaxis, Dr. Church and the other Alcon witnesses identify no new clinical use for olopatadine that arises out of the discovery of its mast cell stabilizing properties beyond the sophism that if olopatadine was never used before as a mast cell stabilizer it therefore must be a new use. It seems to me that this approach seriously strains the meaning of the word \"treating\" and the concept of a new use discovery. The information discovered by Alcon may be useful but it does not, by that fact alone, constitute a new use for olopatadine. A clinician treats a patient for an allergic reaction in the eye by suppressing the troubling or damaging signs and symptoms of the disorder. In the absence of a new clinical use for an old drug, new knowledge about how it works is not patentable. Similarly, the discovery that olopatadine was more effective in the treatment of allergic eye diseases than initially understood (see Affidavit of Martin K. Church, Ph.D., D. Sc. (24 January 2011) at paras 42-43, 46-48 [Affidavit of Dr. Church]) is unpatenable because the improved efficacy of the drug was inherent in its known utility as an antihistamine: see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 177."], ["[46]", "The evidence from the Apotex witnesses that \"treating\" means the therapeutic alleviation of the signs and symptoms of allergic eye diseases without regard to any mechanism of action is in keeping with the plain language of Claim 1 and it avoids an unnatural equating of the word to olopatadine's biological activity as a mast cell stabilizer."], ["[47]", "Alcon maintains that Dr. Buckley and Dr. Calder retreated from their respective affidavits under cross-examination and conceded that Claim 1 incorporated, by implication, the use of olopatadine as a mast cell stabilizer. I do not agree that either witness made such an unqualified concession. Dr. Buckley's answers were given in response to questions relating to references in the disclosure to the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of olopatadine but, under further questioning, he stated that the 094 Patent \"claims to treat and prevent perhaps, but without claiming the pathway or the pharmacological mechanisms\": Cross-Examination Upon Oral Examination of Dr. Roger Buckley (16 August 2011) at p 43 [Cross-Examination of Dr. Buckley]. Inasmuch as Dr. Barney conceded that antihistamines can be used in preventative ways, this evidence is not particularly probative."], ["[48]", "Dr. Calder's evidence under cross-examination is also not as clear as Alcon asserts. Much of the evidence Alcon relies upon from Dr. Calder is concerned with statements from the 094 Patent disclosure and not from the claims", "per se", ". Furthermore, much of that questioning was concerned with the \"inventive concept\" of the patent and not with the word \"treating\" in Claim 1. Her apparent acknowledgement that the list of exemplar diseases in the disclosure implied a use of olopatadine \"as more than simply an antihistamine\" does not, to my mind, detract from her evidence that \"treating\" in Claim 1 does not mean treating as a mast cell stabilizer or as a dual action agent. I do not take her answers under cross-examination to be inconsistent with her affidavit that Claims 1 and 13 are not limited to the use of olopatadine as a mast cell stabilizer or as a dual action medicine."], ["[49]", "Alcon maintains that \"allergic eye diseases\" should also be read-down by limiting the claim to diseases which implicate mast cell degranulation. I accept the point made by Alcon's expert witnesses that a skilled person may understand without being told that each of the diseases specified in the disclosure involves, in some measure, mast cell degranulation. It does not follow, however, that such a person would read that limitation into the claims. Indeed, it is inconceivable to me that the draftsman would fail to incorporate any reference to this essential limiting element in both the claims and the disclosure and thereby leave the point to be inferred by the reader. Alcon's failure to close the category of diseases amenable to treatment with olopatadine implies just the opposite - that is, that the use of olopatadine was being claimed without any limitation beyond the general reference to the treatment of allergic eye diseases. Contrary to Dr. Barney's affidavit at paragraph 47, the 094 Patent is notably unclear if the intention was to include Alcon's proposed limitation. This is particularly the case for diseases like AKC where mast cell degranulation is only a part of the disease pattern and where olopatadine would only be an incidental or adjunct form of therapy: see Cross-Examination of Dr. Buckley at pp 1805-1808; Affidavit of Dr. Church at para 63. This points away from the idea that a skilled person would infer that the 094 Patent claims are limited to the treatment of allergic eye diseases involving mast cell degranulation."], ["[50]", "The evidence before me provides no basis for ignoring the otherwise plain language of Claims 1 and 13 and, in my view, it would almost never be appropriate to limit the language of a patent claim on the strength of such an inference to be drawn from the disclosure."], ["[51]", "It would have been a simple exercise to state Alcon's suggested limitation and to clearly limit the monopoly to the use of olopatadine as a mast cell stabilizer in the treatment of diseases where mast cell degranulation was a clinical concern. It is not reasonable to read in these limitations based on an inference to be drawn from an unstated common feature of the exemplar diseases particularly where olopatadine was a known antihistamine and could also be used on its own or as adjunct therapy in the treatment of the same allergic eye diseases. This is particularly evident when one considers that several of the 094 Patent claims refer to dosages of olopatadine that, according to the experimental data set out in Table 1, would not be effective to achieve any mast cell stabilizing effect. Although Alcon does not assert any of those problematic claims in this proceeding, the skilled reader is trying to interpret all of the claims in context and not in isolation. The inference that would reasonably be drawn by the skilled reader is that Alcon was claiming the use of olopatadine as something other than a mast cell stabilizer at those lower dosage levels."], ["[52]", "The requirement that the subject matter of an invention be distinctly and explicitly defined is not met in these circumstances. A patentee should not readily be permitted to discourage competition with an overbroad claim and, when challenged many years later, retreat from the language it has used by relying on inferences and disclosure references such as these."], ["[53]", "Alcon relies on disclaimers in the 094 Patent in support of its argument that that which is disclaimed is not claimed: see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."], ["[54]", "The 094 Patent does acknowledge the prior art teachings of two Burroughs Wellcome (BW) patents and a Kyowa patent but at the same time substantially discounts their significance. For instance, the BW patents are said to have disclosed olopatadine's antihistaminic \"activity\" and an ophthalmic solution formulation, but the claim for human medical use was said not to have been established by the animal testing disclosed. [See footnote 2] The 094 Patent then goes on to state that the further assertion in the BW patents that olopatadine could be classified as a mast cell stabilizer was unproven because of the problem of mast cell heterogeneity. The Kyowa Patent is characterized in a similar way in the 094 Patent by questioning the utility of olopatadine for treating the human eye. According to Alcon, the field was open to establish olopatadine's utility as a mast cell stabilizer in the human eye."], ["[55]", "I agree with Apotex that the scope of Alcon's disclaimer is far from clear and provides less than what was actually known about olopatadine. Alcon now says in its Memorandum that the 094 Patent contains no criticism of the BW teaching that olopatadine had antihistaminic \"activity\" and that the skilled person was being told that olopatadine was an antihistamine available for the treatment of allergic eye diseases in humans. This submission, however, goes well beyond the scope of what the 094 Patent actually acknowledged about the prior art. On one reading of the disclosure, the impression is left that the utility of olopatadine as an antihistamine, at least for human use, was unproven and that Alcon had shown that it \"possesses significant antihistaminic activity\". Nowhere in the 094 Patent is there an unequivocal acknowledgment that olopatadine was a known antihistamine available for use in the human eye or that animal testing was known to be predictive of olopatadine's antihistaminic efficacy in humans."], ["[56]", "In my view, the skilled reader would not infer from these incomplete prior art disclaimers that Alcon was limiting the word \"treating\" to uses which were intrinsic to mast cell stabilization and disclaiming olopatadine's use as an antihistamine. The failure to make an unequivocal disclaimer with respect to olopatadine's antihistaminic utility supports the interpretation that Alcon was attempting to claim the use of olopatadine generally to treat human allergic eye diseases through Claim 1."], ["[57]", "Alcon says that olopatadine's utility as a mast cell stabilizer is not inherent in its use as a simple antihistamine because it is only at dosages that far exceed what would be necessary for antihistaminic use that its mast cell stabilizing effects would occur. The 094 Patent does not, however, inform the reader of this distinction or instruct on how one could avoid an infringement by this means. Instead, the presence of several other claims in the 094 Patent for the use of olopatadine to treat allergic eye diseases at concentrations much lower than 0.1% belie Alcon's interpretation. There is also evidence from the prior art that indicates that antihistamines can be effectively used at dosages equivalent to 0.1%: see Affidavit of Ines Ferreira, Exhibit \"B.11\" at p 668. Alcon's witnesses conceded that, at such a dosage, a clinician had no control over olopatadine's biological activity: see Cross-Examination of Dr. Martin K. Church (7 September 2011) at p 77; Cross-Examination of Dr. Neal P. Barney, M.D. (21 September 2011) at pp 41-44 [Cross-Examination of Dr. Barney]; Cross-Examination of Phil Lieberman, M.D. (2 October 2011) at pp 86-88."], ["[58]", "In their affidavits, the Alcon witnesses attempted to link the discovery of olopatadine's mast cell stabilization properties to its supposedly novel clinical utility as a prophylactic agent. Although there is a reference in the disclosure to the therapeutic and prophylactic use of olopatadine, there is nothing to indicate that this was a newly discovered and inventive utility. Instead, Claims 8 and 20 refer to a therapeutically effective amount of olopatadine and none of the claims refer to a prophylactic utility."], ["[59]", "Alcon's witnesses did not strongly assert that the inventive concept lay in the use of olopatadine as a prophylactic agent. For example, Dr. Barney agreed under cross-examination that antihistamines could also be used in advance to prevent the appearance of allergic symptoms: see Cross-Examination of Dr. Barney at pp 104-107. His lack of comfort in placing reliance on olopatadine's utility as a prophylaxis can also be seen in the following exchanges under cross-examination:", "389 Q. Let me show you an article.

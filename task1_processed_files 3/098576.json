At that time, the applicant was taken into custody and interrogated. The applicant fled to Colombo in December 2007, fearing he would meet the same fate as his neighbour."], ["[3]", "On January 7, 2009, the applicant states that he and 12 other youths were arrested in connection with a railway bombing. He was detained for six months in a maximum security prison in Colombo, during which time he was beaten. After six months he and the other youths were ordered released by a magistrate because there was no evidence connecting them with the bombing."], ["[4]", "The applicant alleges that in June or July 2010, a group of Tamil militants tried to extort him and then attempted to abduct him when he told them he had no money. He states he also evaded a subsequent attempted kidnapping by men who tried to pull him into a van.

The Board also noted that the applicant was not arrested and had no problems while under regular checks from Colombo police, and therefore found there was no warrant out for his arrest and the police were not looking for him."], ["[7]", "The Board further found that the applicant's ability to leave the country (albeit with the assistance of an agent) shows that he was not a wanted person and thus does not face arrest upon return to Sri Lanka. The Board thus found that the applicant's fear of persecution was not well-founded.", "Change of Circumstances"], ["[8]", "The Board found, in the alternative, that if credibility was not determinative, the change of circumstances would nevertheless be dispositive. The Board cited section 108(1)(e) of the", "IRPA", ", which states that a refugee claim will be rejected if \"the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.\" The Board noted that whether there is a change of circumstances is a factual determination and the durability, effectiveness and substantiality of the change are relevant.

Nowhere in its reasons did the Board state that it disbelieved the applicant's testimony about his detention which was corroborated by documentary evidence. Therefore, the Board's finding that the applicant was not wanted cannot have been determinative without the accompanying finding that individuals with his profile are no longer at risk due to changed circumstances."], ["[14]", "The applicant argues that the Board applied the wrong test for whether there were changed circumstances pursuant to section 108(1)(e) of the", "IRPA", ", and that its analysis of the current circumstances was insufficient.

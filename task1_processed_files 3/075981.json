The first is a physical test and the second is a qualitative test. The test articulated by Mr. Justice O'Reilly in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is essentially a qualitative residency test.

In my view, Mr. Justice O'Reilly was clear. He stated that an applicant must first show that he has established residence in Canada, and then demonstrate that they maintained residence for the required duration. It follows, that a citizenship judge must first determine the point of time when an applicant has established residence in Canada, since that date is not necessarily the date of landing. Here, that date was determined to be October 2, 2002. The Citizenship Judge explained his finding as follows:", "Immediately after landing in Canada you commenced months of foreign travel. After landing on 07 April 2001 you left Canada nine days later on 16 April 2001, returning 09 July 2001 for four weeks in Ottawa while your parents looked for accommodation there.

At this point, you stayed in Canada for 277 days and then left for China and the United Kingdom.", "On this latter basis, your period of residence is between 02 October 2002 and 12 April 2005 when you applied for citizenship.

This site is specifically designed to allow it to receive orders online."], ["[4]", "In May 2011, the respondent decided to make improvements to its Web site. The applicant, who had at that time a college diploma in computer science and was studying in the same field at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, offered his services to the respondent and submitted a cost estimate (Exhibit P-2) for them. The proposed work specifically covered (i) improving the site referencing on search engines such as Google, (ii) facilitating navigation by restructuring the menu, (iii) setting up an automatic recognition mechanism of the client's language; and (iv) freeing up some disk space by incorporating a YouTube link."], ["[5]", "Following discussions, the parties agree that the work would be performed for a lump sum of $2,700. The applicant considered that 15 to 20 business days would be required to complete the said work. Besides the estimate prepared by the applicant, there was nothing in writing setting out the contract made between the parties. Furthermore, for the purposes of completing the work specified in the contract, the applicant was dealing with the respondent's director of sales, Patrick Staquet.

The respondent did not see things in the same way. It considered that the applicant largely exceeded the time to carry out the contract while being unable to deliver a new site meeting the requirements of the said contract. The relationship became bitter and culminated in an exchange of demand letters."], ["[7]", "Specifically, the respondent refused pay the invoice that the applicant sent him on September 21, 2011 (Exhibit P-4), which reflected the price agreed on by the parties and made a formal demand that he perform the work not done, failing which it stated it reserved the right to reduce the contract price and give this work to another programmer (Exhibit D-9). It complained mainly about the fact that the site delivered by the applicant did not provide the function of ordering parts online, a rather essential component, in its opinion, of the work to be completed under the contract."], ["[8]", "In a letter that he addressed to the respondent on October 13, 2011 (Exhibit D-10), the applicant refuted any blame. He argued that to proceed with the redesign that the respondent wanted, given the source files in place at the time, it required a considerable amount of work than had been planned originally, that the respondent said it was perfectly aware and that he accommodated the respondent by accepting to do this work without additional compensation. Furthermore, he warned the respondent that the source files of the site delivered on September 21 are his creation and belong to him and that he can dispose of them as he sees fit, including by blocking access by the respondent's clients to the site so long as the amount for the contract had not been paid. In this respect, the applicant advised the respondent that the above-noted accommodation no longer held and, thus, he claimed from it additional fees of $6,390. Therefore, the total bill for completing the work to upgrade the respondent's Web site increased to $10,494.84. The applicant requested payment within five days."], ["[9]", "The letter of October 13, 2011, did not specifically address the respondent's allegation that the new site did not offer the function for ordering parts online.

In a letter dated October 17, 2011, and signed by counsel representing it at the time (Exhibit P-6), the respondent warned the applicant against any interruption of service of his client's Web site and informed him that it wished to terminate the contract. However, in order to settle the dispute [translation] \"as quickly as possible\", it proposed to pay the applicant $2,500.00 [translation] \"in exchange for a full and final release, handing over the computer content of the site on DVD, a commitment from him to transfer the site to another server hosting it and keeping the site online until this transfer.\" Counsel specified that failure to respond to this offer within three days of its receipt, his instructions are to [translation] \"file any legal proceeding enabling (his) client to recover the computer data required for its Web site to function and to claim any damages it has suffered.\""], ["[11]", "On November 21, 2011, the respondent advised the applicant, through this same counsel, that it had no other choice but to completely reprogram its Web site given the [translation] \"major deficiencies\" affecting the work carried out by the applicant (Exhibit P-7). It explained that to do so, it [translation] \"started from scratch\" and [translation] \"did not keep any programming (he) completed\". Considering that he did not respect the contract between the parties and that, as a result, it had to pay for corrective work, the respondent informed the applicant that it reserved the right to claim damages that it felt it suffered. According to Exhibit D-11, the corrective work was performed in November 2011 by Sylvain Mallet, for $2,400. The Web site reprogrammed by Mr. Mallet was put online on November 21, 2011.

At the trial, the applicant amended his statement of claim so as to substitute the claim for lost profits on fees and profits collected by the respondent for a claim of [translation] \"predetermined damages\" within the meaning of section 38.1 of the Act."], ["[15]", "On July 2, 2013, the respondent produced an amended defence and counterclaim to which is attached an action in warranty against the programmer, Sylvain Mallet. It argued essentially, in defence, that it purchased the work of the applicant, which confers on it the right to use the computer program developed by him. It denied, among other things, that it ordered additional work from the applicant and considered that it had the right, after serving a demand on him to correct his computer program in order to make the new Web site functional, to have a third party do the required corrective work."], ["[16]", "As plaintiff by counterclaim, the respondent claimed from the applicant the sum of $25,000 as a result of his failure to deliver the new Web site within the timeframe specified in the estimate and for the loss of profits resulting from the deficiencies of this new site. Finally, it argued that insofar as there was a copyright infringement, as the applicant alleged, the infringement is the fact that Sylvain Mallet was given the task in October 2011 to reprogram its Web site. Mr. Mallet did not appear in this case."], ["[17]", "On June 6, 2014, the respondent paid the amount of the invoice of September 21, 2011.

In addition to providing his testimony, the applicant heard an expert witness, Adam Jolly, PhD student and lecturer on computer science at the Mathematics and Computer Sciences Department at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. Mr. Jolly's mandate was to determine, based on archived content of each Web site, whether the version delivered and put online by Mr. Mallette on November 21, 2011, plagiarized the one designed by the applicant. Mr. Jolly concluded that the version delivered and put online by Mr. Mallet was the result of partial but significant plagiarism of the version developed by the applicant."], ["[19]", "The respondent did not cross-examine Mr. Joly and did not have an expert testify on this issue. It also abandoned its counterclaim and its third party claim against Mr. Mallet. Moreover, it did not dispute that the computer program developed by the applicant under the contract between the parties is a \"literary work\" within the meaning of the Act."], ["[20]", "Once these updates were carried out, the respondent called three witnesses: the owner of the company, Mr. Charrette, the creator of the respondent's original Web site, Mr. Drouin, as well as the respondent's factory supervisor, Mr. Garceau. Mr. Charrette was cross-examined at length on Mr. Staquet's role in the business and on the functionality of the site delivered by the applicant on September 21, 2011. In particular, he was not able to say that this site was not functional and recognized that it is possible that equipment orders were made through this site between September 21 and November 21, 2011. As for Mr. Garceau's testimony, it was used to establish that the ordering of parts online continued to be done from the original site developed by Mr. Drouin, since neither the site developed by the applicant nor the site reworked by Mr. Mallet allowed this type of orders. Furthermore, nothing very useful came out of Mr. Drouin's testimony."], ["[21]", "Given the death of Mr. Staquet before the hearing was held, the evidence provided by Mr. Charrette and Mr. Garceau as to the relationship between the respondent and the applicant during the production phase of the work planned in the contract between the parties ended up being peripheral and, ultimately, of little use.", "III.", "Issues"], ["[22]", "Given the realignment of the respondent's position at trial, I find that this case raises the following three questions:", "i.

I agree."], ["[34]", "In a matter of copyright involving work to improve software, the Federal Court of Appeal found, as had the trial judge, that there is an implied user licence (REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). In this matter, Orio Canada had retained the services of Mr. Tremblay's company (Service Informatique Professionnel) to improve his appointment management software in the field of automotive mechanics, the Service Appointment Monitor (SAM). The new version of the software delivered by the applicant was twice the size of the original version and contained several complementary modules.

The estimate itself does not contain any clause relating to copyrights. The agreement between the parties is silent in this regard. However, it appears to me to be clear that the contract between the parties contained, to the benefit of the respondent, an implied user licence for the computer program that the applicant was to deliver, a licence that also authorized him to modify the said program in such a way as to improve its effectiveness based on his needs.

The respondent speculates that any mathematical error committed by the Judge did not impact his conclusion. In fact, it is far from clear that the Judge would have granted citizenship if he had understood that a shortfall existed even when he attributed a duration to Mr Vijayan's trips that was extremely favourable to him.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[86]", "Further, the Citizenship Judge offers no explanation for his finding that the respondent's frequent trips outside Canada resulted from a clearly temporary situation. It is not obvious from the record that the respondent intends to cease his business travel to the UAE or the travel related to his photography anytime soon. One can plausibly assume that the respondent has every intention of continuing his frequent travels to the UAE to collect the more than $3 million owing to him, and also of preserving his reputation as a world class photographer.

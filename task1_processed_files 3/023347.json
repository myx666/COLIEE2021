The Applicant has had no apparent trouble with customs: he obtained a passport in 2000; he travelled for work to Qatar in 2002; he returned to Colombo in 2004; and he left Sri Lanka for Canada legally.

In the Applicant's view, his sworn statement, the letters, the 2008 complaint and the country conditions evidence were not before the RPD, referred to new developments in the risk faced, corroborated his well-founded fear of persecution, and contradicted key RPD findings (including the adverse credibility findings). The Applicant contends that the PRRA Officer did not analyze this evidence and simply rejected substantive portions of it as not being new or not containing new grounds of risk."], ["[27]", "It is well established that a PRRA application is not an appeal or reconsideration of the negative decision of the RPD; it is meant to assess new risk developments between the hearing and the removal date: see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 12;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .

Even if the Applicant did not want to endanger his sister by contacting her, he could have been reasonably expected to present the 2008 complaint to the RPD by obtaining a copy with the assistance of his friend Arasaratnam, who was a point of contact between the Applicant and his family after he left Sri Lanka (see the Affidavit of the Applicant, Applicant's Record, p 17)."], ["[30]", "As for the country conditions evidence, it was rejected because it was not relevant to the Applicant's personal circumstances and did not rebut the RPD's findings.

It is well established that country condition documentation cannot be relied on to establish a personalized risk. The RPD determined that the Applicant did not provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to support his fear of returning to Sri Lanka. It also had a number of serious credibility concerns with the Applicant's allegations regarding what has happened to him and his family since 2008. The RPD concluded the Applicant did not establish that Sri Lankan authorities perceived him to be associated with the LTTE because he and his family were permitted to travel from Jaffna to Colombo, he secured a passport in 2000, he had previously returned from work abroad in March 2004, and he appeared to have departed from Sri Lanka in 2010 with a legitimate passport. Given this reasoning, the Applicant needed to rebut the RPD's finding that he was not perceived to be an operative of the LTTE. The country conditions documents could not be used to achieve that result; they could only show that persons perceived to be associated with the LTTE are possibly at risk of persecution."], ["[31]", "Finally, the Applicant's personal affidavit and the letters from his sister and spouse referred to the same alleged risk that was before the RPD and that had not been found to be credible. Of course, the Applicant rightly points out that new evidence cannot be rejected solely on the basis that it relates to the same risk. That being said, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> made it clear that such evidence can be properly rejected \"if it cannot prove that the relevant facts as of the date of the PRRA application are materially different from the facts as found by the RPD\" (at para 17). This is precisely why the PRRA Officer rejected the Applicant's affidavit and the letters from his sister and spouse."], ["[32]", "The Applicant submits that his affidavit and the letters pertain to new developments in the forward-looking risk he will face if returned to Sri Lanka and that they corroborate his prior evidence of risk.

To accept that he continued to be threatened by the Karuna group, the RPD would have had to conclude that he had already been threatened. This is not the case. As my colleague Justice Barnes stated in similar circumstances, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> does not open \"the PRRA process to a re-examination of evidence that was already before the IRB or that could have been put to the IRB but was not.

In the context of a PRRA application, an oral hearing is only required where the conditions of s. 167 are met and only where \"there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility\".

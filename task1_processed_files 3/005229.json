However, what is contested is the Visa Officer's choice of awarding points with respect to the commerce degree rather than the business administration degree. It is this choice that is the subject matter of the statutory interpretation question at the heart of the present Application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "III. Statutory Interpretation  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The statutory interpretation question is whether the factors of attaining a Master's or Doctoral degree and completing the requisite full time studies stated in s. 78(2)(f) of the", "Regulations", "should be read conjunctively or disjunctively.

As the reasoning goes behind not awarding \"double points\" because an applicant has two Master's degrees, if it takes only 16 years to attain a first Master's degree and this degree is not a prerequisite to a further Master's degree attained, points are to be awarded on the basis of only the first Master's degree with no consideration being given to the second Master's degree. Justice Heneghan's finding in", "Khan", "at paragraph 14 emphasizes the point:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"The language of subsection 78(3) is clear. No points can be awarded for two Master's degrees. The Applicant completed 19 years of full-time studies but only 16 years were required in Bangladesh in order to obtain a Master's degree. He falls within the scope of paragraph 78(2)(e). No reviewable error was committed by the Officer. This case is parallel to the decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "In", "Kabir", "at paragraph 14, Justice Heneghan makes a similar statement. The Visa Officer in the decision presently under review came to the same conclusion by awarding only 22 points and not the full 25 points pursuant to s. 78(2)(f). Counsel for the Respondent explains that, as a matter of practice, the 22 points awarded to Mr. Hasan is based on the application of the \"OP6 - Federal Skilled Workers Manual\" which visa officers consult: if under s. 78(2)(f) a person has a Master's degree but only the imputed 16 years of education to obtain it, points are awarded according to the next highest category being s. 78(2)(e) (Respondent's Further Memorandum of Argument, paras. 12 and 13).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "Since Justice Heneghan specifically relies on Justice Mactavish's decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ", I find a comment is necessary about the evidence of legislative intention relied upon to reach the conclusion in that case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "The education component of Ms. Bhuiya's application for permanent residence as a Skilled Worker was a Master's degree in Commerce which took 16 years to attain and a diploma in personnel management which took a year to attain. Justice Mactavish applied s. 78(3)(b)(i) to conclude that the credential that results in the highest number of points is the Master's degree which took 16 years to complete and points were awarded accordingly. Because he has two Master's degrees, the factual matrix of Mr. Hasan's application presently under consideration is more complex from that presented by Ms. Bhuiya, and, as a result, the factual finding in her case is not a precedent to guide the outcome of his case. However, the decision is cited as precedent for its conclusion on legislative intention.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "In", "Bhuiya", ", Justice Mactavish refers to the Regulatory Impact Assessment Statement (RIAS) relating to the", "Regulations", "and makes this finding at paragraphs 17 to 19:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"In this case, a review of the RIAS discloses that the reason for requiring that a candidate have both a particular degree", "and", "a specified number of years of education was to promote consistent standards in the assessment of a candidate's education and training, given the range of education and formal training systems around the world.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"The RIAS uses a Master's degree as an example, noting that to qualify for the maximum number of points for a Master's the candidate must also have 17 years of education.", "In other words, the years of education requirement is clearly intended to establish minimum standards for each type of degree", ".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"The fact that Ms. Bhuiya may have spent one additional year in school after obtaining her Master's degree does not turn her 16 year Master's degree into a 17 year Master's degree.\" (Emphasis added)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "The RIAS that Justice Mactavish is referring to is quoted by Justice Russell in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> s follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"...

For example, for a Master's degree, an applicant must also have completed a total of at least 17 years of full-time or full-time equivalent studies", ".

There is no clear statement in the", "IRPA", "or the", "Regulations", ", or in the RIAS for that matter, that when two Master's degrees are presented as credentials by an applicant, the complete study history of the applicant cannot be considered. This point is made by Justice Mandamin  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "at paragraph 30: \"in my view the whole of s. 78 of the", "IRPA Regulations", "is directed at assessment of educational accomplishment\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "In my opinion, the lack of clarity in the", "Regulations", "has caused visa officers to adopt a self-help approach.

As the argument goes, in order for this legislative intention to operate to provide a benefit to an applicant with two Master's degrees, the factors named in s. 78(2)(f) must be read disjunctively. That is, if an applicant such as Mr. Hasan has two Master's degrees and a total of 17 years or more of full-time studies in his or her complete academic history, the last of the degrees must be assessed together with the applicant's complete academic history.

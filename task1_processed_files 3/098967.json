On February 10, 1983, the appellant filed an application for registration of its trademark and design \"Pure Life\" [see footnote 1] on the basis of its use in Canada since February 1, 1983. Registration was sought for use in association with the following wares:", "\"skin cleaner, skin freshener, skin moistener, body oil, deodorant, shampoo, skin ointment, cleaner namely a multipurpose phosphate free biodegradable concentrated cleaner, vitamins, protein, laxatives, mineral supplements in tablet form, throat lozenges and enzymes, herbs in tablet and liquid form, dietary fibre, dehydrated foods namely raw shelled almonds, apple sauce, sulphur free apple sauce, apple slices, apricot slices, bacon bits, banana slices, cut green beans, beef, green bell peppers, beef bouillon powder, chicken bouillon powder, butter powder, cabbage dices, carrot dices, cross cut celery, fruit and nut cereal, cheddar cheese, chicken, coffee substitute, sweet corn, date nuggets, egg mix, fruit galaxy, orange flavour gelatin, strawberry flavour gelatin, ham, macaroni, margarine powder, mushrooms, spinach noodle, quick rolled oats, onion slices, peach slices, peanut butter powder, pear slices, garden peas, split peas, yellow popcorn, potato dices, potato granules, potato slices, whole prunes, raisins, long grain brown rice, shortening powder, vegetable soup blend, spinach flakes, vegetable stew blend, tomato crystals; tea, water treatment unit namely an inhome water purifier and filter which attaches to a kitchen faucet, a meal replacement nutrition bar, pet powder, household and garden insecticide, jogging suits, T-shirts, aprons, sprouter trays and round mini-trampolines.\""], ["[3]", "During the initial examination of the application, the appellant amended its application to include a disclaimer of the word \"pure\". The application was advertised for opposition purposes on July 27, 1984. In order to avoid a threatened opposition by the Quaker Oats Company of Canada Ltd. the appellant cancelled the wares \"fruit and nut cereal\" and \"quick rolled oats\" from its trademark."], ["[4]", "On November 21, 1984, after obtaining permission to belatedly oppose the registration, the respondent Imasco filed a statement of opposition. It opposed the registration on the grounds that the trademark applied for is not registrable, the applicant is not the person entitled to registration and the applied for trademark is not distinctive in view of the opponent's prior use and registration of its trademarks \"Life Brand\" and \"Life Brand & Design\" [see footnote 2] for a wide variety of health care and personal care products including vitamins and minerals."], ["[5]", "The respondent filed evidence (Gamble affidavit) of prior registration and use of its trademark dating back to 1973 and of similar trademarks by its predecessor in title dating back to 1946. The respondent sells some 360 \"Life Brand\" products exclusively through its own chain of drugstores. Shopper's Drug Mart and Pharmaprix (of which they have 400 throughout Canada.) Sales for the year 1984 totalled roughly $80,000,000.00. The \"Life Brand\" products have been extensively advertised throughout Canada through all the media including frequent mailouts to 6,000,000 Canadian households of the respondent's own Money Saver magazine. The respondent also filed evidence of employee training programs where employees are taught how to promote \"Life Brand\" products within stores."], ["[6]", "The appellant's sales are conducted on a one-to-one basis through a multilevel sales structure similar to that used by Amway. The appellant stated that it would not sell its wares through retail outlets since this would be in breach of its agreement with its distributors. The appellant claims to have distributors of its products in every Canadian province."], ["[7]", "Both sides filed affidavits, submitted written arguments and were represented at the oral hearing of the Opposition Board. The Hearing officer finally determined that the appellant had failed to disprove the burden upon it as to the likelihood of confusion between its trademark and design and the respondent's with respect to the wares highlighted in the list of wares given above. As a result registration was allowed in respect of the appellant's other wares such as dehydrated foods and other miscellaneous items such as T-shirts and aprons. In reaching this decision the Hearing officer noted that all three grounds turn on the issue of confusion between the two marks; took note also of the material time in respect of each ground of opposition; and also considered the issue in light of all the circumstances of the case, in particular those listed in s. 6(5) of the Trade Marks Act, keeping in mind that the test as to the likelihood of confusion is a matter of first impression and imperfect recollection. In fact the Hearing officer seems to have given his attention to all relevant considerations. I have some reservations however as to how he dealt with the matters raised."], ["[8]", "Subsection 6(5) provides that:", "\"In determining whether trademarks or trade names are confusing, the court or the Registrar, as the case may be, shall have regard to all the surrounding circumstances including", "(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trade marks or tradenames and the extent to which they have become known;", "(b) the length of time the trademarks or trade names have been in use;", "(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;", "(d) the nature of the trade; and", "(e) the degree of resemblance between the trade marks or tradenames in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.\""], ["[9]", "Fox states in Canadian Law of Trademarks and Unfair Competition (3d Ed. 1972), at p. 150-151 that in determining whether or not a mark is confusing the question should be framed as follows:", "\"[The] question is whether those who meet with the two kinds of goods in the course of trade will suppose, because of the marks alone, that they are the goods of the same person's trade, whether as manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor, or retailer.\"", "It is from this perspective, I think, that any question of confusion should be approached."], ["[10]", "The appellant has raised numerous grounds of appeal. In his written argument, counsel for the appellant summarised these grounds as follows:", "\"1. The initial burden of the appellant is to show merely that the Registrar has gone wrong in any of his findings.", "\"2. The Registrar wrongly characterized the respondent's marks as being inherently distinctive, and in failing to appreciate their suggestive, if not descriptive character, accorded respondent's marks as inordinate scope of protection.", "\"3. The failure to properly assess the degree of resemblance in the appearance of the marks of the parties in their respective totalities led to the erroneous conclusion that the marks were fairly similar visually.", "\"4. The evidence as to the nature of trades of the respective parties lessens any likelihood of confusion.", "\"5. The state of the register evidence as a surrounding circumstance was not given proper weight.", "\"6. Evidence of facts subsequent to the date of filing the Statement of Opposition is relevant in determining whether there is any likelihood of confusion.", "\"7. The absence of evidence of actual confusion confirms that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion in this case.\""], ["[11]", "In support of these arguments the appellant filed additional affidavit evidence upon appeal, in accordance with s. 56(5) of the Trade Marks Act. The affidavits place in evidence dictionary definitions of the words \"life\" and \"vitamins\" which suggest that the former is suggestive of the latter. The affidavits also offer proof of the appellant's sales figures both before and after the material date, which is November 21, 1984, the date of filing of the opposition. I find that for the purpose of this appeal it is sufficient to refer merely to the additional evidence of facts before the material date. The affidavit of Richard Ellis, president of the appellant indicates that from 1982 to 1984, the number of distributors of the appellant's products operating in Canada, increased from 12,464 to 16,126, and gross sales for 1984 reached $2,180,021, of which $1,744,00 were generated by sales of wares for which registration was rejected by the Hearing officer. The affidavit also indicated that the appellant does not advertise extensively but has advertised its products on magazine and radio. It publishes an annual newsletter which is circulated to its distributors, and it trains its sales people through seminars which it conducts in various Canadian communities. This evidence was not before the Hearing officer, indeed in his decision the officer stated:", "\"The applicant has evidenced no use of its trademark in Canada. Thus, I must conclude that the applicant's mark had not become known at all as of the material time.\""], ["[12]", "The new evidence before me is uncontradicted and given its great relevance I find I must treat the present appeal as a trial de novo, not withstanding the deference owed to the Hearing officer's decision. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  misapprehension of the facts before him, by the Hearing officer. His decision repeatedly refers to the respondent's \"registered mark 'Life & Design'\". In fact there is no such mark registered by the respondent, but only one which should be referred to as \"Life Brand & Design\". The word \"Brand\" is part of the mark and cannot be dropped, or considered as merely part of the Design. The appellant's evidence reveals that prior to obtaining registration of the trademark \"Life Brand\", the respondent's predecessor-in-title conceded that it was compelled to discontinue the use of the word \"Life\" as a trademark for pharmaceuticals and to replace with the words \"Life Brand\". This error may have tainted the Hearing officer's view as to the merit of the respondent's right to exclude uses of other marks containing the word \"Life\"."], ["[13]", "Regardless of his appreciation of the facts I find further that the Hearing officer fell into the trap of dissectional analysis in basing his finding of a likelihood of confusion on a comparison of certain aspects of the parties' designs rather than considering them in their totalities as the case law requires. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 551, at 554-555 (F.C.T.D.)). From the position of a potential consumer of these products, even one of imperfect recollection viewing the products on the basis of a first impression, it is unlikely that two products labelled with the parties' trademarks and designs would be confused, or would be assumed to be the product of the same manufacturer or supplier. The design in question, when viewed in their totalities are extremely dissimilar. All that they have in common is that they both use, in differing degrees of prominence, the word \"Life\"; even this word - the only point in common - has lettering which is in a different case and script."], ["[14]", "This finding is supported by the fact that the word \"Life\" itself is a very common word, suggestive of the wares it describes and has therefore a low level of inherent distinctiveness, and as such it is only entitled to a low level of protection. Moreover no one can appropriate and monopolize a common word of the English, or French language ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 115-116 (S.C.C.)). The case law has also established that \"the first word or first syllable in a trademark is far the more important for the purpose of distinction\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 188 (F.C.T.D.)). In the present case the first words and syllables of the competing marks are not at all the same, so much so that the marks are visually and phonetically different."], ["[15]", "Furthermore the State of the Register evidence adduced by the appellant establishes that the word \"Life\" is very commonly used as part of registered trademarks. Eighty-two registered trademarks contain the word life and fully 29 of these are registered for use in association with health or personal care products. This would indicate to me that the average consumer is well-accustomed to distinguishing between trademarks containing this word and would not be confused by the registration of yet another mark in which it appears. Moreover these facts bring the case almost squarely within the facts of the Pepsi-Cola case and should have led the Hearing officer to hold that there has been a general adoption of trademarks which include the word \"Life\" in respect of health and personal care products ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[16]", "Finally the nature of the trade, in particular the channels of trade of each party, are so very different that any possibility of confusion can be discounted. The respondent's products are sold exclusively in its own stores - Shopper's Drug Marts and Pharmaprix - whereas the appellant's products are not even sold on a retail basis. They are sold instead through direct, person to person, sales. In failing to take account of this fact the Hearing officer failed to give adequate attention to s. 6(5)(d) of the Act."], ["[17]", "Turning once again to s. 6(5), I would summarize the essential features of this case as follows:", "a) Both trademarks and designs are distinctive enough to be registered but have low inherent distinctiveness. The respondent's is the least distinctive of the two. The respondent's mark is, however, very well-known throughout Canada, whereas the appellant's is much less well-known.", "b) At the material time the respondent's trademark had been in use for a long time whereas the appellant's trademark had just begun to be used. There is thus nothing to indicate that they could, or could not, coexist without giving rise to confusion. Longevity of use does not however entitle the respondent to greater protection.", "c) The wares to which the trademarks would be applied by the parties are fairly similar overall and identical in many cases. This heightens the likelihood of confusion considerably.", "d) The nature of the trade at the material time is altogether different. So much so that any likelihood of confusion can be discounted almost immediately.", "e) Viewed in their totalities the competing trademarks and designs are very dissimilar in appearance. Their sound is quite different as well, esspecially in the first words which are altogether different in sound. The ideas suggested by each are similar, both have a connotation of health. But the respondent's is more suggestive of longevity of life, backed by the force of modern medicine, whereas the appellant's suggests clean living, good diet and homeopathic remedies.\""], ["[18]", "With the added weight of the State of the Register evidence, and keeping in mind the question framed by Mr. Fox, which suggests that of all the factors listed in s. 6(5) paragraph (e) is the most important, I have no hesitation in finds that the appellant has amply satisfied the onus of disproving any likelihood of confusion."], ["[19]", "The appeal is allowed with costs to the appellant.", "Appeal allowed.", "Editor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/slg", "Footnotes", "1. The applicant's trademark and design is the following:", "[Trademark symbol omitted. See original source.]", "2. The respondent's trademark as it is commonly used today, appears as follows:", "[Trademark symbol omitted. See original source.]", "[End of document]"]]}

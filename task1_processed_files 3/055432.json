As for whether the Respondent established that Canada is where she \"regularly, normally or customarily lives\" or has \"centralized her mode of existence\", the evidence provided by the Respondent to support her citizenship application falls well short in terms of documentary proof.

There are deficiencies in the Respondent's evidence that cast doubt on her intention to establish a permanent home in Canada. First, the Respondent exceeded the allowed absences from Canada by a significant margin. The Respondent explains that her absences from Canada stemmed from family commitments, such as visiting her ill brother and mother, both of whom have now died, and visiting Iran for her sons' weddings and the birth of her grandchild. But there is no explanation as to why she had to stay for more than four months in Iran on each of her sons' weddings, nor is there any reason given for her six months stay in 2003."], ["[31]", "In addition, the Respondent has limited documentary proof of residency. Her home is registered in her husband and son's names. Her bank account is joint with her husband. She did not provide the tax returns requested by Citizenship and Immigration Canada because she states she did not file them due to lack income. Her only proof of part-time employment was a letter provided by her husband attesting to her work in his restaurant. Her proof of participation in community activities was limited to a letter from a friend and a letter form the Canadian Mandaean Association that fails to outline any details of her actual involvement. She provided grocery and store receipts, but there is no indication that she is the purchaser of the items. Also, ten of the fifteen receipts she provided to establish her presence in Canada are dated on days that she has admitted she was not present in Canada."], ["[32]", "It may well be, as the Respondent explains in her letter to Citizenship and Immigration Canada dated July 24, 2009, that in her cultural traditions family property and bank accounts are not in a women's name. But the Citizenship Judge failed to address this argument, and the Court is left to speculate as to the weight given to this explanation in the assessment of her attachment to Canada. While the Citizenship Judge was satisfied, after his interview of the Respondent, that she qualified for citizenship, he failed to explain why this was the case. Thus, even though a new interview with the Respondent may result in the same decision being taken with respect to her application, this is not a \"clear cut\" case where it would be appropriate for the Court to use its appeal powers to reach its own decision on the issue of residency.

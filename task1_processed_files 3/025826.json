Little information was included to trigger a best interests of the child [BIOC] analysis for the Applicant's four grandchildren, one of whom is a Canadian, and three of whom were included in the positive refugee claim in (ii).

After all, most likely way she would see her family in the future was based on her ability to obtain a Supervisa (due to the limitations on the parental and grandparents' class that were known to the Intervener).

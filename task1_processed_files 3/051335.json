The Applicant says that he was targeted because he was an active member of the TNFJ. After this beating, he continued to engage in activities with the TNFJ, such as distributing pamphlets to rally the attendance of Shia in the community to religious ceremonies. The Applicant says that as a result of these activities he was targeted by the Sepah Sehaba (\"SSP\"), a militant organization, and on October 22, 2001, he was attacked by four masked and armed men driving motorcycles. These men said that they must teach this \"infidel Shia Hazara boy\" a lesson for being against the SSP. The Applicant says that he was hit in the head with the butt of a pistol, beaten and kicked and then saved by an approaching car that saved the Applicant's attackers, who left stating that, next time, he would be killed."], ["[4]", "He claimed that the incident in October, 2001 made him realize that \"it was no more possible to live in Pakistan.\" He also stated that \"subsequently,\" he obtained a U.S. visa and flew to the United States.

It did not make sense that the Applicant would be targeted because of some activities of his father's that occurred when the Applicant was 11 or 12, and for which the father was not targeted. Further, the documentary evidence revealed that ordinary persons such as the Applicant are not targeted in the way he suggested."], ["[7]", "Moreover, the Applicant's credibility was not enhanced by his delay in making a claim in Canada, or by his failure to claim in the United States. His credibility was also undermined by his claim that he did not investigate the situation in the United States for refugee claimants before he left Pakistan, despite having friends there and the fact that his father had been in communication with them as recently as two days before the Applicant left. The Board expected people who fear for their safety to flee at the earliest opportunity and to seek protection as soon as they are beyond the reach of their persecutors. Hence the Board felt there was no subjective or objective basis to the claim and the Applicant had not demonstrated any risk concerning his return to Pakistan.", "ISSUES"], ["[8]", "The Applicant raises the following issues:", "Did the Board err by making a decision of implausibility and negative credibility?", "Did the Board make a capricious finding of fact unsupported by evidence that the Applicant does not have a prospective danger of persecution in Pakistan?", "ARGUMENTS", "Applicant", "Did the Refugee Division err by making a decision of implausibility and negative credibility?"], ["[9]", "The Applicant submits that the Board erred in concluding that his testimony was not credible or plausible.

The Court made the following remarks about unreasonable inferences:", "He testified that he had no money and that he stayed in Greece to accumulate sufficient money to come to Canada. He testified that he had heard that refugee protection in Greece was problematic and that he feared deportation to Syria if he exposed his illegal status and tested refugee protection here...", ". . . . .", "The explanation provided by the Applicant, considering all of his circumstances, was not an unreasonable one.

He was unfamiliar with the refugee process and arrived in the U.S. following the September 11 attack, which led him to feel a negative atmosphere towards persons from his part of the world. Fearing that he would not be considered for asylum, he came to Canada after a mere nine days. For the reasons given in El-Naem, the Board erred in drawing an unreasonable inference.", "Profile in Community"], ["[14]", "The Board also found it implausible that Sipah-e-Sahaba attacked the Applicant and his brother rather than their father, who had been their target six years earlier. However, the Applicant explained in his hearing that by the time his own persecution began, his father was no longer religiously active and visible in the Shia community. At the same time, the Applicant became very active and visible, particularly in his Imam Bargah, throughout the years immediately leading to his persecution. As a result, he became a target of the Sipah-e-Sahaba while his father was no longer of any interest to them as he was not seen as a religious or ideological 'threat'."], ["[15]", "The Applicant says he also explained in his hearing that he was targeted more than executive members of the TNFJ due to the fact that he was very visible, active and young. He says he was a threat to the Sipah-e-Sahaba who eliminate youths of his profile before they grow older and more active in their religion. The Applicant testified that most of the activities he performed on behalf of his Imam Bargah took place outdoors. He was, therefore, highly visible in the eyes of the Sipah-e-Sahaba who may have also suspected that he had an important role in his religious community.

His stay in the U.S. was a mere 9 days before he made a refugee claim in Canada."], ["[37]", "The reason given by the Board for finding this explanation implausible was that the Applicant and his father did not make enquiries and familiarize themselves with the law before the claimant left Pakistan.

The Board is imposing its own view of what it thought would have been a sensible approach to the situation and using this as a reason to doubt the Applicant's explanation that he didn't really appreciate the nature of the problem until he arrived in the U.S. If this finding was the whole basis for the Decision, it would be unsafe, but the Board goes on to make other findings and this issue cannot be viewed in isolation."], ["[40]", "Similarly, a delay of 9 days before making a refugee claim in Canada, given the Applicant's explanation was hardly significant enough to call into question the Applicant's evidence that he feared for his life in Pakistan.

The Applicant had been a young boy of 11 when the threatening phone calls began. The Board concluded as follows:", "The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, it is implausible that the father would go unscathed for all those years, and that the SSP would wait until 2001 and choose to attack the claimant. The panel finds this evidence untrustworthy and lacking in credibility."], ["[45]", "The Applicant explained how the intensification of his activities and rising profile resulted in him becoming a target. At the hearing of this matter before the Court, Applicant's counsel pointed out that the precipitating event for his leaving (the attack by SSP thugs that was interrupted by a passing motorist) took place in October, 2001, by which time the Applicant had become a TNFJ member."], ["[46]", "The Respondent's counsel countered this by saying that the second attack occurred in October 2001 after the Applicant obtained his visa. So the Applicant was obviously planning to leave before the attack occurred."], ["[47]", "Respondent's counsel may be correct in this regard, but this is not what the Board relied upon in its Decision. The reference is clearly to the March 21, 2001 attack. No consideration is given to the October, 2001 attack which occurred after the Applicant became a TNFJ member. This is a material omission in the Board's reasons that renders its negative credibility finding in this issue unsafe.", "Failure of the SSP to kill the Applicant"], ["[48]", "The Board found it implausible that the SSP did not kill the Applicant when they had the opportunity to do so during the October, 2001 attack when he was hit with the butt of a pistol."], ["[49]", "The Applicant explained in testimony that this attack was intended as a warning and that the SSP merely wanted to teach him a lesson on this occasion, but the threat was clear that he would be killed in the future. This is why he left Pakistan."], ["[50]", "The Board's reasoning on this issue was as follows:", "I find this implausible. If these four attackers wanted to kill the claimant, they had the opportunity to do so in this incident. The claimant was hospitalized for two hours. Following this incident, the claimant, after discussions with his father, decided to leave the country. I find the claimant's accounting of these events lacking in plausibility and do not believe the events occurred."], ["[51]", "This rationale does somewhat miss the point of the Applicant's claim that a warning was intended by the SSP. However, the actual words used during the attack, as related by the Applicant, are as consistent with a warning as an intention to kill on that occasion. Teaching a lesson can be done by death or a beating and a warning. What the Board doesn't address, however, was the Applicant's clear testimony that the attack was interrupted and that this was why he wasn't killed. Also, the Board's findings on this issue, rather than being based upon any internal inconsistency in the Applicant's testimony, are nothing more than the Board's own musings about what it thought ought to have happened. These are thin and unsafe grounds for a negative finding on this point. However, once again, this finding has to be examined in context of the Decision as a whole and the other reasons stated by the Board for its negative credibility finding.", "Other Reasons"], ["[52]", "The Applicant argues that the Board's finding that he does not have a prospective danger of persecution in Pakistan is based upon a determination that a change in circumstances has occurred and the situation of Shias has improved. As usual, the criticism is that this conclusion is based upon \"a highly selective use of the documentary evidence\" and \"the tribunal has ignored evidence contrary to its conclusion that was before the panel at the hearing.\""], ["[53]", "The problem with his ground of attack is that the Board makes no such finding and does not refer to a change in circumstances or adequate state protection."], ["[54]", "The Board finds, rather, based upon documentary evidence, that the Applicant does not have the profile for someone at risk in Pakistan, so that there is no objective basis for his claim.", "Profile"], ["[55]", "The other significant reason why the Board refused the claim was that it did not believe the Applicant had the profile of someone at risk. The Board found it implausible that the Applicant had been targeted rather than other active members of the TNFJ or the executive of the Iman Bargah. The Applicant's response was that he was young, but he was zealous and highly visible. He was the one collecting donations for the Iman Bargah, and he was recognizable by the badge and the receipt book that he carried."], ["[56]", "The Board found it \"implausible that, if the claimant were in fear of the SSP for collecting donations for the Iman Bargah, he would flaunt this activity rather than using discretion.\""], ["[57]", "As the Applicant points out, not all of the attacks on Shia that appear in the reports are on doctors and lawyers and high-ranking religious officials. He was young, zealous and visible in the community. There is nothing inconsistent about his collection activities, which he stopped immediately after the October, 2001 attack. He was an ideological threat to the SSP and a successor to his father who worked outdoors for his religious community."], ["[58]", "I am highly cognizant of the Respondent's warning that the Court should not merely re-weigh evidence and come to a different conclusion from the Board. This is particularly so in the case of a Decision based upon credibility."], ["[59]", "What troubles me here is that so much of the Decision rests upon negative plausibility findings and negative inferences: failure to make a claim in the U.S.; implausible target for the SSP; failure of the SSP to kill the Applicant when they had the chance. None of these findings have much of a base to them. They are not based upon inconsistencies internal to the Applicant's evidence but upon the Board's own view of what someone in the position of the Applicant and his family should have done, or upon what the Board thought would have been a more likely outcome in the circumstances. When it comes to making decisions based upon these kind of criteria, the Board is no better placed than the Court. Also, inferences and conclusions are drawn by the Board without really addressing strong evidence that points the other way (e.g. the fact that the October, 2001 attack was interrupted). The one place where the Decision appears to identify a strong inconsistency - the discrepancy between the March 21, 2001 attack and the Applicant's joining the TNFJ at an earlier date - doesn't really amount to much when the precipitating event was the October, 2001 attack which happened after the Applicant joined the TNFJ."], ["[60]", "One such weak finding might be acceptable, but this Decision is based upon a series of implausibility findings that fail to deal with plausible contrary evidence and/or miss the real point of the Applicant's narrative i.e. that the October 2001 attack was what stopped all his activities and caused him to conclude he had to leave Pakistan to save his life."], ["[61]", "In total, they add up to a Decision that is patently unreasonable and should be reconsidered.", "ORDER"], ["[62]", "THIS COURT ORDERS that", "1.

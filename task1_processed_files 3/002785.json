In my view, their assessment of the situation is correct."], ["[46]", "I note that under the terms of sale approved by Justice Harrington in October 2011, the gross asking price of the Vessel was already substantially lower than the total value of the advances provided by Sargeant. Moreover, the sale was subject to a court approved commission for the broker on a sliding scale beginning at 10%. Had an offer been made during the life of that listing agreement, it was likely to result in a significant loss to Sargeant. The Order provided that no Commission would be payable to the Broker where Sargeant or any corporate entity associated with him was the ultimate buyer. That option has been available to Sargeant, it would appear, from the outset. It is irrelevant, in my view, that the present buyer has likely made a private arrangement with the broker concerned to pay a commission that does not factor into the net amount on offer."], ["[47]", "Sargeant and Comerica have conceded that the Vessel must be sold at some point. Sargeant's intent, according to his written representations, is to engage a shipbuilder to complete and deliver the Vessel", "if his priority position is confirmed [emphasis added", "]. In the meantime he seeks an order for removal of the Vessel to the Richmond shipyard which he controls. The cost of removal of the Vessel to that shipyard is said to be in the vicinity of $300,000.00 for which Sargeant says he would claim a priority charge."], ["[48]", "Sargeant says that upon completion of the Vessel, he intends to apply for sale of the Vessel using the Federal Court sale process. He would seek approval of a \"credit bid\" whereby the debt owing on the mortgage would be used to purchase the Vessel without the payment of any additional cash. The sale of the vessel under authority of a Federal Court order, subject to the determination of priority charges, would render the vessel free and clear of any other encumbrances."], ["[49]", "The contingent nature of Sargeant's intent is dependent upon three factors, the Landlord argues:", "(a) that Sargeant is successful before the Federal Court of Appeal and his mortgage interest is upheld (subject to the possibility of leave being granted for appeal to the Supreme Court;", "(b) that Worldspan's position on the import of s 12.1 of the VCA fails; and", "(c) that there is no equitable re-ordering that would allow the", "in rem", "trade creditors to assert priority over the mortgage."], ["[50]", "I would add to this, Mr Al-Saleh's assertion of a constructive trust in any claim that Sargeant may have on the Vessel remains an open issue."], ["[51]", "It is not at all clear, in my view, that Sargeant and Comerica will succeed in establishing their priority claim as secured creditors. There remains a claim by the owner, Worldspan, to advances never paid by Sargeant for the construction of the Vessel as the work continued, and the claims of Offshore, the Landlord and Al-Saleh to contend with. The merits of those competing claims are not for me to determine. That will be resolved at the priorities hearing down the road. As Sargeant and Comerica vigorously argued during the hearing, I must concern myself with the situation as it stands to-day."], ["[52]", "That situation, as I see it, is that a valid offer has been made to purchase the Vessel for the amount of USD $5 million net of any commission that may be payable to the broker. The Vessel has been under arrest for 4 years and the resolution of the competing claims will not be soon accomplished. The length of an arrest is a factor to be taken into account where the asset is decreasing in value. The only evidence before me is that this is not an improvident sale."], ["[53]", "The Vessel will further decline in value as the parties await resolution of their claims. If the present offer is lost the creditors will all be prejudiced. There is no evidence before the Court that Sargeant has the means to pay any priority charge on the Vessel without a sale to a third party and considerable evidence that any interest he may have in the Vessel may be subject to Al-Saleh's USD $36 million fraud judgment against him and his corporation."], ["[54]", "Comerica's interest is no greater than Sargeant's under the terms of the VCA and Builder's Mortgage. The record indicates that they have already received at least partial reimbursement of their loans from Sargeant. In its submissions to the several courts that have dealt with this matter, including the Federal Court of Appeal on the appeal of Justice Strickland's decision, Comerica has explicitly recognized that the Vessel had been arrested at the instance of a third party and will be sold by the Federal Court. The fact that they now think the amount to be generated by that sale is inadequate is insufficient to prevent the sale in light of the uncontradicted evidence before the Court."], ["[55]", "In the result, I am satisfied, exercising my discretion", "de novo", ", that it is fair and just and in the interest of all concerned that the sale of the Vessel be approved. The terms and conditions of this sale shall be in accordance with the Order of Prothonotary Lafrenière dated June 30, 2014.

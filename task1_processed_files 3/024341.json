The importance of this rule in Canadian administrative law is well-demonstrated by the large number of decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada on point:", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED."], ["[31] Administrative law judgments and textbooks describe this rule in many ways: the doctrine of exhaustion, the doctrine of adequate alternative remedies, the doctrine against fragmentation or bifurcation of administrative proceedings, the rule against interlocutory judicial reviews and the objection against premature judicial reviews. All of these express the same concept: absent exceptional circumstances, parties cannot proceed to the court system until the administrative process has run its course. This means that, absent exceptional circumstances, those who are dissatisfied with some matter arising in the ongoing administrative process must pursue all effective remedies that are available within that process; only when the administrative process has finished or when the administrative process affords no effective remedy can they proceed to court. Put another way, absent exceptional circumstances, courts should not interfere with ongoing administrative processes until after they are completed, or until the available, effective remedies are exhausted."], ["[32] This prevents fragmentation of the administrative process and piecemeal court proceedings, eliminates the large costs and delays associated with premature forays to court and avoids the waste associated with hearing an interlocutory judicial review when the applicant for judicial review may succeed at the end of the administrative process anyway: see, e.g.,", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED. Further, only at the end of the administrative process will a reviewing court have all of the administrative decision-maker's findings; these findings may be suffused with expertise, legitimate policy judgments and valuable regulatory experience: see, e.g.,", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED. Finally, this approach is consistent with and supports the concept of judicial respect for administrative decision-makers who, like judges, have decision-making responsibilities to discharge:", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED."], ["[33] Courts across Canada have enforced the general principle of non-interference with ongoing administrative processes vigorously. This is shown by the narrowness of the \"exceptional circumstances\" exception. Little need be said about this exception, as the parties in this appeal did not contend that there were any exceptional circumstances permitting early recourse to the courts. Suffice to say, the authorities show that very few circumstances qualify as \"exceptional\" and the threshold for exceptionality is high: see, generally, D.J.M. Brown and J.M.

Mullan,", "Administrative Law", "(Toronto: Irwin Law, 2001) at pages 485-494. Exceptional circumstances are best illustrated by the very few modern cases where courts have granted prohibition or injunction against administrative decision-makers before or during their proceedings. Concerns about procedural fairness or bias, the presence of an important legal or constitutional issue, or the fact that all parties have consented to early recourse to the courts are not exceptional circumstances allowing parties to bypass an administrative process, as long as that process allows the issues to be raised and an effective remedy to be granted: see CITATION_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED. As I shall soon demonstrate, the presence of so-called jurisdictional issues is not an exceptional circumstance justifying early recourse to courts."], ["[29]", "Although said in a different context, factual findings and the record compiled by an administrative tribunal, as well as its informed and expert view of the various issues, will often be invaluable to a reviewing court (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED) per Mr. Justice Gonthier at CITATION_SUPPRESSED."], ["[30]", "Furthermore, the Commissioner has persuasive power.

To the extent that he has already received at least one of the 99 pages in full in another Information Request, the point is moot.

He first asked for a search of the Winnipeg Offices of Environment Canada, but now says he would be satisfied with production of the remaining pages which were found in the offices of Fillmore Riley.

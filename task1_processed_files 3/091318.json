The Recall Rules fundamentally alter the Election Code depriving a duly elected person (and their supporters) of the right to hold office and to even seek that office for two election periods."], ["[27]", "The Applicant pointed out in argument that the effect of the Recall Rules is to potentially frustrate the wishes of the majority.

On the basis of the bailiff's certificate and the additional evidence contained in the statutory declaration which confirms how the bailiff identified Mr. Chun, and confirms that the person served was the person depicted in a photograph of Mr. Chun, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the show cause order was properly served on Mr. Chun.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "With respect to Mr. Chun's knowledge of the existence of the order, the plaintiffs were unable to prove that the order was physically given to Mr. Chun. I find, however, that Mr. Chun had actual knowledge of the order and that he learned of it on or about August 16, 2000.

As of July and August 2000, Mr. Chun resided at 25 - 8591 Blundell Road, Richmond, B.C. Both a private investigator, Mr. Snidanko, and the solicitor who supervised the execution of the Anton Piller order testified that the Anton Piller order was personally served upon Mr. Chun and executed at that location, and that this was Mr. Chun's residence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "2. A process server testified that on August 16, 2000 he attended at 25-8591 Blundell Road, Richmond, B.C. and spoke to Mr. Chun's wife. He knew her to be Mr. Chun's wife because she had identified herself as such on an earlier occasion. The process server left the order with her in an envelope addressed to Paul Chun. The process server then returned to his office and mailed a further copy of the order to Mr. Chun at that address.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "3. Mr. Chun had previously been served with the Anton Piller order on July 11, 2000. As noted above, the supervising solicitor testified to this, and further testified that at that time she explained the order to Mr. Chun, and he told her that he understood the order. She later met with Mr. and Mrs. Chun in her office on July 18, 2000. At that time the lawyer told Mr. Chun that she intended to return to Court to obtain a further order prohibiting Mr. Chun from dealing in items that infringe Louis Vuitton's trademarks. Mr. Chun advised her that he understood this. Then, on July 20, 2000 the supervising solicitor spoke to Mr. Chun by telephone and advised him that she was faxing a letter to him. She then faxed a letter to Mr. Chun. That letter said:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"Further to our telephone conversations and meeting on July 18, 2000, please sign below in the space provided, indicating that, subject to Federal Court approval, you acknowledge and agree to the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "1. an adjournment of the matter until such time as determined by a Federal Court Justice, and in any event no later than October 2, 2000; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "2. that during the period of the adjournment Justice Rouleau's order, granted July 10, 2000 and served upon you on July 11, 2000, will be extended and remain in effect. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "A copy of the letter was then faxed back to the solicitor and a signature appeared on the signature line above the words \"Acknowledged & Agreed to on July 20, 2000, by: Paul Chun\".

The private investigator testified that on September 10, 2000 he attended at the Richmond night market and watched Mr. Chun put out merchandise and sell it. Mr. Chun spoke to the investigator who asked Mr. Chun if he was aware that his sales of counterfeit Louis Vuitton products was in contempt of a court order. The investigator testified that Mr. Chun \"simply shrugged and he asked if I was returning with lawyers\". Mr. Chun then handed the investigator his business card and said \"Phone me if you are\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada considered the requirement that one must have knowledge of an order before one can be found to be in contempt of that order.

Almost two centuries ago, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Lord Chancellor Eldon held that a party could not be held liable in contempt in the face of uncontradicted evidence that he or she had no knowledge of the order. In", "Ex parte Langley", "(1879), 13 Ch.

And, in a matter of this kind, bearing in mind that the liberty of the subject is to be affected, I think that those who assert that there was such a notice ought to prove it beyond reasonable doubt.'  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"More recently, this Court adverted to the knowledge requirement in contempt in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Dickson, J.

Their evidence was reasonable, and in each case was given in a straightforward manner, without hesitation or inherent contradiction. Witnesses were excluded from the courtroom until they had completed their testimony. I accept the evidence of all the witnesses who testified to be truthful. Having found the evidence to be truthful, I conclude that the evidence set out above, without doubt, supports the inference that Mr. Chun had actual knowledge of the order. It is reasonable to infer that he acquired this knowledge by on or about August 16, 2000 when the order was left with his wife at his home and also mailed to his home. On July 18, 2000, Mr. & Mrs. Chun had been told that a further court order would be obtained against Mr. Chun and on July 20, 2000 I am satisfied that he consented to the continuation of an injunction against him. On September 10, 2000, Mr. Chun made no protestation at the statement that his activities were in contempt of court. This evidence supports the inference that Mr. Chun had knowledge of the order.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "With respect to whether the order was complied with, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt for the following reasons that it was not in the following respects.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "With respect to the specific allegations of contempt, while there are six allegations, items 4, 5 and 6 allege the identical conduct as alleged in items 1, 2 and 3. The only difference is that the first three items are styled to constitute contempt by disobeying an order of the Court, while the last three items are styled as interfering with the orderly administration of justice or impairing the authority or dignity of the Court by disobeying its order. In my view, the last three allegations add nothing. What is material is whether the order was disobeyed as alleged in items 1, 2 and 3 of the show cause order.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(a) Did Mr. Chun offer for sale, distribute, advertise, promote, store or display counterfeit Louis Vuitton products on September 2 and September 10, 2000 at the Richmond night market?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "The private investigator testified that on September 2, 2000 he went to the location of the Richmond night market.

On that date he watched Mr. Chun arrive and unload his van with two assistants and begin to put out his merchandise at the kiosks for sale. The investigator described the merchandise to include counterfeit Louis Vuitton handbags. The investigator photographed the kiosks, taking a close-up photograph of the small leather goods which appear to bear some of the Vuitton trademarks. Ten photographs taken by the investigator were identified by him and tendered in evidence. It was on this occasion that the investigator spoke to Mr. Chun to inquire if he was aware that he was in contempt of a court order. The investigator testified that Mr. Chun asked him \"why are you bothering with me? I'm not making any money. It's going to them\" waving to his assistants who were at the far end of the kiosk.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "The investigator was asked how he knew the goods were counterfeit. He said that he knew that genuine Louis Vuitton merchandise is only sold from two outlets in Vancouver: Holt Renfrew and the Vancouver Louis Vuitton shop.

He is a trademark lawyer who joined Louis Vuitton in January of 2001. On September 10, 2001 he was sent by Louis Vuitton to New York to run its anti-counterfeit program. Mr. Barbault testified in detail about the nature of his training that enables him to distinguish between genuine Louis Vuitton products and counterfeit items. He testified that genuine Louis Vuitton merchandise is only sold in Louis Vuitton stores and outlets. Paul Chun has never been an authorized dealer of Louis Vuitton product.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "This evidence satisfies me, beyond a reasonable doubt, that on September 2, 2000 and September 10, 2000 Mr. Chun offered for sale, promoted, stored and displayed counterfeit Louis Vuitton products at the Richmond night market.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(b) Did Mr. Chun store counterfeit Louis Vuitton products on October 28, 2000 at 2288 No. 5 Road, Unit 140, Richmond, B.C.?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "The private investigator testified that on October 28, 2000 after receiving \"intelligence that Mr. Chun was still active in the sale of Louis Vuittons\" he followed Mr. Chun to a storage complex at 2288 No. 5 Road.

And among the leather goods I saw three handbags with the Louis Vuitton monogram design and I saw several other handbags that appeared to be in the Damier design. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "I am not satisfied that this evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Chun owned those goods or was storing them. I also am not satisfied that evidence obtained by peering through a crack in the window covering establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that counterfeit goods bearing the Vuitton trademarks were stored there. This allegation of contempt therefore fails.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(c) Did Paul Chun offer for sale, sell, distribute, promote, store, display or advertise counterfeit Louis Vuitton products on August 8, 2001 in the parking lot of Fantasy Gardens?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[26]", "The private investigator testified that on August 4, 2001 he asked another private investigator, Heather Walker, and his daughter-in-law, Nicole Snidanko, to call Mr. Chun on his cell phone and to arrange a meeting where Nicole Snidanko could purchase a counterfeit handbag. He testified that on August 8, 2001, he gave his daughter-in-law $200.00 and showed her a picture of Mr. Chun. He then went to the location where he was told by Ms. Walker or Ms. Snidanko that the meeting was set to take place. While there, the investigator observed a van bearing a license plate number known to belong to Mr. Chun pull up to the storage facility. Half an hour later the investigator saw his daughter-in-law and Ms. Walker arrive. The driver of the van motioned them to follow his vehicle to a more private section of the parking lot. At that point the investigator was able to identify the driver of the van as Paul Chun. Afterwards, his daughter-in-law returned $100.00 to him along with a purse that she, Ms. Walker and Mr. Snidanko signed and dated. He later sent the purse to New York for inspection by representatives of Louis Vuitton. The purse was later returned to him and he produced and identified it at the contempt hearing so that it was tendered in evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[27]", "The investigator's daughter-in-law, Nicole Snidanko, testified that she called Mr. Chun on August 4, 2001 for the purpose of purchasing a Louis Vuitton handbag from him. She arranged to meet him on August 8, 2001. On August 8, 2001, she met with her father-in-law who briefed her and gave her $200.00 with which to purchase a handbag. She also reviewed with another investigator, Ms. Walker, the procedure to follow so that Ms. Walker could videotape the meeting. She then drove with Ms. Walker to the Fantasy Gardens parking lot where she had agreed to meet Mr. Chun. Ms. Snidanko was able to identify Mr. Chun from a picture shown to her earlier by her father-in-law. After following Mr. Chun to a more quiet part of the parking lot Mr. Chun opened up the side of the van he was driving. There she saw six containers containing the items Mr. Chun had for sale. Approximately 100 of them bore the Louis Vuitton insignia. Mr. Chun told her that if she could get 25 friends together he could have a Louis Vuitton showing and everyone could purchase product. He said he would have about 200 items if he was given a month's notice. Ms. Snidanko found a bag to purchase. The asking price was $110.00, but she was able to bargain down the price to $100.00. After paying she then left with Ms. Walker. They met Mr. Snidanko and all of them signed and dated the inside of the purse she had purchased.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "Ms. Walker testified.

Mr. Chun identified himself when they met as \"Paul\" and asked the two women to follow him to a more private area of the parking lot. Inside his van, Ms. Walker saw two cardboard boxes, two plastic garbage bags and two suitcases. Mr. Chun began opening everything and showing items, most of which displayed the Louis Vuitton insignia. When asked about a particular item, Ms. Walker was given a catalogue by Mr. Chun to flip through. Mr. Chun told her that she could order anything from the catalogue, but she would have to pay \"upfront\" and it would take two weeks for the item to arrive. When asked if he had a display room, Mr. Chun advised that he no longer maintained a show room because he had been raided and had been relieved of $35,000.00 worth of goods. If Ms. Snidanko could get a group of 25 women together he would display at least 200 Louis Vuitton items for her.

He was able to ascertain that the bag was a counterfeit because this bag does not exist as part of the Louis Vuitton collection, the grain of the canvas was not correct, the workmanship was a standard below that required by Louis Vuitton, and the label was improperly attached. After analysing the bag he returned it to Mr. Snidanko. When asked the price of a bag similar to this purse, Mr. Barbault said that a similar genuine purse would sell for approximately $800.00 Canadian at a Louis Vuitton store.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[30]", "This evidence, together with the testimony of Mr. Barbault set out above as to the proper outlets of trade for genuine Louis Vuitton merchandise satisfy me, beyond a reasonable doubt, that on August 8, 2001 Mr. Chun offered for sale, sold, promoted, stored, displayed, and advertised counterfeit Louis Vuitton products.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "THE APPROPRIATE DISPOSITION  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[31]", "Counsel for the plaintiffs argues that this is a most serious contempt. Additional evidence was led that Mr. Snidanko attended at the Sandman Inn in Richmond on January 17, 2002. Mr. Snidanko saw Mr. Chun and spoke with him in a suite where Mr. Chun was selling merchandise. According to Mr. Snidanko every surface in the suite was covered with leather goods and he estimated that in the order of 150 items were counterfeit Louis Vuitton merchandise.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[32]", "As well Madam Isabel Sallé testified. She has been a manager of Louis Vuitton retail outlets for five and a half years. She learned of Louis Vuitton goods being sold in a hotel in Montreal. She attended and spoke with a gentleman who gave her his business card. She identified the card and it was received in evidence. The card identified \"Paul Chun\" who was described as a \"Brand Name Specialist\". A sign at the hotel also identified \"Brand Name Specialist, Paul Chun\". Madam Sallé confirmed the gentleman she spoke with was the same person shown in the photograph taken by Mr. Snidanko and identified by him. She saw between 75-100 items marked with what appeared to be Vuitton trademarks. Mr. Chun told her the product was not real Louis Vuitton. He said the products came from Korea and on one month's notice he could provide one thousand bags for her.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[33]", "Ms. Sallé purchased a cell phone holder and a key fob.

In", "Cutter (Canada) Ltd.", ", supra, Urie, J.A., said in assessing the amount of the fine what was relevant was 'the gravity of the contempt in the context of the particular circumstances of the case as they pertain to the administration of justice' (page 562).

Pinard, J., of this Court in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), also stressed the importance of deterrence as the principal factor in ensuring that those orders will not be breached again because 'if those who get caught were to get away unscathed that would encourage such activities and consequently destroy the intended effect of the laws that have been passed' (page 13, line b). Pinard, J., in assessing a fine, took into account the value of the counterfeit goods sold. He also ordered solicitor-client costs capped to a maximum.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"23.

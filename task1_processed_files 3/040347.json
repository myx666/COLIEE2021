The issue is whether the discontinuance of the Respondent's function had a good faith economic justification. The central point is whether securing economic advantages under the Second Tripartite Agreement required the discontinuance of the Respondent's function. There was no evidence that it did. Also, the term \"economic advantages\" in Chief Clearsky's affidavit, is too vague and general to be of much help to the Court in the present application;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "ii. In paragraph 4(c), Chief Clearsky says that he indicated in his testimony that \"the re-organization set out in the negotiated Tri-Partite Agreement of April 1, 2005, provided positive economic and financial benefits to my First Nation.\" The same comments apply to this statement as to 4(a) above;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "iii.

But Chief Clearsky does not say that he testified to the portion of paragraph 6 quoted above. Chief Clearsky's testifying after the hearing that he did think about these things is not evidence that he testified to this effect before the Adjudicator. Consequently, there is nothing in these words to contradict or temper the findings and conclusions of the Adjudicator on point;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "iv. In paragraph 7, Chief Clearsky does not say that he testified to an \"implied understanding\" before the Adjudicator, and the other points he raises were addressed by the Adjudicator.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[56]", "All in all, there is nothing in Chief Clearsky's affidavit that undermines the findings of the Adjudicator on the central issue that the Applicant did not discharge the onus of showing that there was a good faith economic justification for discontinuing the Respondent's function. The lack of good faith economic justification distinguishes the case at bar from most cases of this sort, including those submitted by the Applicant at the hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[57]", "My findings on this central issue are determinative. Other reasons given by the Adjudicator for assuming jurisdiction are in the alternative. However, I will address the Notice of Termination issue and the Reorganization issue, both of which are connected to the primary ground of good faith discontinuance of a function.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Notice of Termination  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[58]", "The Applicant says that the Respondent was advised by Sergeant Richard on October 24, 2005 that her position had been eliminated and transferred to the Public Service Commission. The Applicant was then provided with the posting of the job application for the Public Service Commission for which she applied. Based upon these facts, the Applicant says that the \"termination notice therefore was clearly communicated to the complainant.\" It is difficult to see what relevance this has for the matter before me.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[59]", "To begin with, the fact that the Respondent \"was never terminated from her employment or notified of the discontinuance of her function\" is an alternative ground in the Decision for assuming jurisdiction. The notification issue is mentioned under the \"good faith economic justification\" ground, but only because it reinforces the Applicant's failure to demonstrate good faith economic justification.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[60]", "Secondly, whatever Sergeant Richard may have told the Applicant on October 24, 2005 about her position with the Applicant was not notification that her employment had been terminated and her position eliminated. It was after the fact and the evidence is clear that the Applicant did not bother to provide the kind of notification that is required by law. See", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 38 and the", "Code", "at section 230.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[61]", "Thirdly, the fact that the Respondent may have applied for the new position is not evidence that she was provided with the required notice of the termination or discontinuance of her previous position. Just because the Respondent may have attempted to mitigate her situation does not mean that the Applicant dealt with her in good faith or in accordance with the law regarding adequate notice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Reorganization  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[62]", "The Applicant refers to the", "Prud'Homme", "decision and says that it should not be faulted for eliminating the detachment clerk's position \"as a result of the employer's diligence in reorganizing its structure for economic reasons and that in the course of the reorganization, the detachment clerk's position was eliminated.\" This is a repetition of the argument that \"there was no evidence before the Adjudicator that this decision was nothing but 'genuine and made in good faith.'\" Economic reorganization is a decision for the employer to make but it does not eliminate the requirement to show good faith economic justification for the discontinuance of a function.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[63]", "Once again, this is an argument about the weighing of evidence. The Decision is based upon the Applicant's failure to demonstrate that the discontinuance of the position was made in good faith for economic reasons. As discussed earlier, I can find nothing to suggest that relevant evidence was either overlooked or inappropriately weighed by the Adjudicator in coming to the conclusion that the Applicant had not demonstrated good faith.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "JUDGMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[64]", "THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "1.", "The Application is dismissed and this matter shall be returned for further hearing before the Adjudicator.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "2.", "The Respondent shall have her costs of this Application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[End of document]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"]]}

This issue has always been decided in the same very clear manner, by independent committees, tribunals or even by the Department of Indian Affairs. Specifically, the answer in these cases has always been, in essence, that since 1987, the band has had control of its members, and had full latitude to accept non-status individuals as members and to allow them to vote and be candidates at elections.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Applicant's record, p. 29.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "The investigator added that this approach has been confirmed and reinforced since the 2008 adoption of a custom election code, section 2.1 of which states that one of the four councillor positions must be filled by a non-Aboriginal elector and the position of Chief may be held by either a status or non-status elector. For this provision to have meaning, he wrote, [translation] \"there must be non-status members on the Band List and the electoral list\" (applicant's record, p. 30).

Additionally, the withdrawal of a candidate to the Chief position was communicated to all voters at the time of the vote, even though the ballots could not be reprinted in time.

With no evidence to the contrary (and the applicant chose not to question Mr. Dionne), the assumption is that Mr. Dionne was respecting the rules that govern the occupational conflicts of interest and the code of discipline.

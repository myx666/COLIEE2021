The investigation was initiated to review the files of a number of refugee claimants that contained numerous similarities; this was done to determine whether the methods and networks used by these persons to enter Canada were a threat to the integrity of Canadian immigration programs. Generally, the purpose of the investigation was to examine whether the refugee claimants at issue were members of a group that used the same fraudulent, organized scheme to enter Canada and seek refugee status there. The investigation report refers to the research, methodology and analysis that was done and the CBSA's findings.

The affidavits of two CBSA officers filed in support of the motion for a confidentiality order confirm this allegation."], ["[9]", "In his motion for a confidentiality order, the Minister initially requested that the CBSA's investigation report (Exhibit M-13) be removed in its entirety from the Court file. The applicant, for his part, did not object to the investigation report being declared confidential but did object to it being removed in its entirety from the file on the basis that it was relevant evidence for the purposes of determining the application for leave and judicial review of the RPD's decision. I share the applicant's view in this regard. At the hearing, I indicated to the parties that, in the circumstances of this case, it seemed clear to me that the CBSA's investigation report was relevant for the purposes of determining the application for leave and judicial review because the RPD's decision was, in part, based on the investigation report.

In my opinion, the Minister cannot,", "posteriori", "and after using the report to justify his opposition to the applicant's refugee claim, ask the Court to simply remove it from the file.

However, pursuant to section 9 of the PSDPA, independently of any punishment authorized by law, a public servant is subject to appropriate disciplinary action, including termination of employment, if he or she commits a wrongdoing.

The boundaries between their authorities are not always easy to establish, and there is little consensus on, or comfort with, the resultant need to act in concert and develop strong relationships. For example, the Commission noted that, when an error or omission is identified in the course of an audit, an investigation into alleged fraud or an investigation into an external appointment, it cannot act alone to address all aspects of wrongdoing that may be associated with an appointment. Although the Commission may revoke an appointment or impose conditions on the delegation to a deputy head, in some instances a wrong may be done by someone else, such as another employee, a manager or even [Human Resources (HR)] staff. In such a situation, the responsibility rests with the deputy head to determine follow-up action, including the possibility and nature of discipline.", "The authorities for the PSC, deputy head and employer are laid out in not one, but two statutes.

That is strangely similar to the disclosure of possible wrongdoings committed by two federal public servants in an appointment process.

So why did the Commission not refer the case to the appropriate deputy head for investigative purposes?"], ["[89]", "It can be argued that the approach taken by the Commission merely led to an unjustified duplication of the investigation process surrounding the commission of a possible wrongdoing by a federal public servant.

In such a case, it is mandatory to follow the mechanisms and procedures set out in the PSLRA and in any applicable collective agreement; in which case the public servants would be able to challenge the lawfulness of any disciplinary action through a grievance that could be referred to an adjudicator by the Public Service Labour Relations Board (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 537).

In particular, he claimed that Ms. Samatar was not informed that she was the subject of an investigation, and that she was also not informed prior to her interview of the evidence that was already before the investigator. On the first issue, Ms. Samatar was informed, both in writing before her interview and verbally during the interview, of the appointment process that was under investigation under section 69 PSEA, and of the possibility that adverse conclusions could be drawn against anybody involved in the appointment process or in the matter under investigation. On the second issue, after her interview, Ms. Samatar was provided with a factual report containing the facts gathered from the file and from all the individuals interviewed. She was given the opportunity to comment on the factual report, which she did."], ["[179]", "The breach of procedural fairness is flagrant in the applicant's case. It is very unfortunate that further investigation into the applicant's allegations was not requested in August 2010 by the Commission's President. Furthermore, at the hearing before this Court, counsel for the respondent, on behalf of the Commission, continued to strongly and convincingly defend the untenable position that the investigation had been conducted in accordance with the rules of natural justice and that there was no injustice with respect to the applicant. The specious arguments made by the respondent have no merit and are borderline \"frivolous and vexatious\", if not completely inappropriate and abusive under the circumstances.", "VII. EXERCISE OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION"], ["[180]", "Given the reasons provided above, the application for judicial review will be allowed. On this point, subsection 18.1(3) of the FCA confers broad discretion on the Court to choose the appropriate remedy. The same is true for the award of costs; the plenary and discretionary power of the Court in this area requires consideration of the factors listed in subsection (3) of Rule 400 and any other issue that it deems relevant."], ["[181]", "It is in exercising that judicial discretion that the Court is more apt to engage in meaningful dialogue with the parties; despite what it looks like, it is not a monologue or soliloquy, pardon the pleonasm. For the judge, alone in his chambers after the \"truth-telling\", comes the difficult arbitration between right and wrong; the right words must be used, especially when, like today, the judge is addressing the losing party. I hope to perform a useful function and convince both parties that it is not the argument of the \"strongest\" that should prevail, but that of the \"sharpest\", in the figurative sense of the word, certainly, in both cases."], ["[182]", "I will therefore begin with the issue of remedies, but I could also have started with costs; regardless of the process, the result of my reflection, of this voluntary decision after deliberation, is the same, and here is the fiat. While considering the facts of the matter, there is a need to \"repair\" in the noblest sense of the word; I say \"repair\" and not \"excuse\" what is inexcusable."], ["[183]", "First, I wish only to offer a solution to the dispute that is fair and as expeditious and economic as possible. I, myself, acknowledge that the issue of jurisdiction or reasonableness - regardless of its qualifier - is one that is difficult and that merits particular attention from the higher courts. Also, despite the strong doubts that I may harbour on the Commission's jurisdiction and the reasonableness of the impugned decision, to prevent, as much as possible, the applicant from having to justify before a court of appeal the correctness in law of the opinion that I may have on this subject, I have decided that it is in the best interests of justice to not provide a final ruling on these issues."], ["[184]", "There will therefore be no declaration in my judgment on the Commission's jurisdiction or the reasonableness of the impugned decision. Moreover, the scope of any declaration of illegality and nullity in the judgment that follows is to the exclusive benefit of the applicant and relates entirely to the finding of fraud and to the \"corrective actions\" in the impugned decision and in the impugned investigation report, insofar as the applicant is affected by the impugned decision and the impugned investigation report."], ["[185]", "I repeat, according to the evidence in the record, the Commission's breach of the rules of procedural fairness is flagrant and is sufficient in itself to set aside the impugned decision, which adopts the impugned investigation report. Normally, when that is the only defect, the Court may refer the matter back to the tribunal in accordance with instructions that it deems appropriate in the circumstances. In all cases, it is a discretionary power and, because of the conduct of a party, or even the possible mootness of a referral to the tribunal, the Court may choose to simply set aside the impugned decision."], ["[186]", "That is the case here. In my opinion, the severity of the injustice committed against the applicant, the intransigence shown by the Commission up until now, the apprehensions one may have of bias or the predisposition taken by the Investigations Directorate, the stubbornness and the ferocity with which certain positions were advanced by the respondent (whether or not on behalf of the Commission), the fact that it was not until March 2010 that an investigation was conducted into allegations that go back to 2007, the absence of guarantees that the Commission will put in place new investigative and adjudicative processes to take into account the legitimate expectations of persons suspected of fraud make referring the applicant's case back to the Commission not in the best interests of justice."], ["[187]", "And now for costs. Fortunately, there is at least one point on which both parties agree: it is desirable that the Court award to the successful party a lump sum in lieu of taxed costs. That is, of course, the applicant. In the end, she obtained a perfect score."], ["[188]", "The applicant is claiming, on a solicitor-and-client basis, costs in the amount of $14,134.25 for the application for judicial review, together with fees and disbursements in the amount of $1,261.58, which the applicant paid to her former counsel at the time of submissions made to the Commission in the summer of 2010 before the filing of this application for judicial review."], ["[189]", "The respondent concedes that, if the applicant is successful, she is entitled to costs, which should be assessed in accordance with Column III of the table to Tariff B. That is the minimum the successful party is normally entitled to. The applicant should not have one cent more. The respondent therefore agrees to pay $2,484.25, which includes the disbursements. The respondent also notes that the applicant did not pay the amount of $650 attributed to him following the dismissal of the applicant's motion for production of documents."], ["[190]", "In the exercise of my discretion, given the specific - and I would say, exceptional - circumstance of this case, I am of the view that the applicant is entitled to an increased award of costs that exceeds the party and party costs normally awarded in the absence of an order to the contrary by the Court; that means those assessed in accordance with Column III of the table to Tariff B of the Rules. Beyond the importance and the complexity of the issues and the other usual criteria, in this case, the irreparable harm already suffered by the applicant, the conduct of the opposing party-which had the effect of unnecessarily prolonging the case-the public interest, the better administration of justice and the maintenance of public confidence in the justice system are determining factors in the exercise of my discretion with respect to costs."], ["[191]", "We are talking here about a simple public servant who had to spend thousands of dollars to assert her rights and have the impugned decision, the unlawfulness of which is blatant, set aside. The Court does not have the authority to retroactively set aside the impugned decision, which is unlawful and the negative effects of which - simply think of the obligation to obtain written permission from the Commission before participating in a competition since August 2010 - continue to this day."], ["[192]", "I cannot even imagine the consequences on the applicant's reputation and all of the distress related to the communication of the impugned decision and the impugned investigation report to her employer, let alone the communication to the RCMP of \"any other relevant information\", and I am not forgetting all of the stress that this may have caused the applicant for more than two years, even though public dissemination on the Web has not yet occurred."], ["[193]", "Clearly, nothing has been easy in this case, which was vigorously defended, on behalf of the Commission, by the respondent. Even if the applicant's \"victory\" seems complete today, it might as well be a \"Pyrrhic victory\", since she has already suffered irreparable harm because of the Commission. The public interest requires this to be taken into consideration. Otherwise, the Court's message may not get out and the confidence in the administration of justice and in the justice system may suffer irrevocably."], ["[194]", "Many people in the same situation as the applicant - I hope this not to be the case - might not have, in the future, the applicant's courage, resources and tenacity to denounce, at the risk of losing their career and everything they have, something that appears to be, at least in the case at bar, an investigative process that is totalitarian and has no place in a free and democratic society. It seems to me that public servants accused of fraud have the right to know that suspicions weigh against them and that they can defend themselves before the final verdict from the Commission."], ["[195]", "I do not judge the Commission or its staff; others will do that in my place and will ask the questions that need to be asked when the time comes. However, an investigative process must not - as laudable as it is in the beginning - invite people in power to embark on a type of \"witch hunt\" under the guise of legality: to go beyond the information received, to search for and flush out, using sometimes questionable means (interception of private e-mails), everyone suspected of fraud, at the risk of doing \"collateral damage\". I repeat, in a context where we are talking about ensuring public confidence in our institutions, the end cannot justify the unfair means that were used by the investigator in this case. A blind institutional machine must not get carried away and start making \"innocent victims\" in the name of some administrative or operational imperative."], ["[196]", "I am also not saying that the applicant is \"innocent\" of the actions alleged by the Commission-others may have to determine that someday, who knows? However, today, given the evidence before me, and limiting my comments to the applicant's specific case, I say \"no\": no to the inconsistency, no to the concealment and no to the inequities throughout the investigation in this case. We live in a system of democracy where there is a Rule of Law that everyone must respect, including public institutions and the Commission, which have such an important mandate."], ["[197]", "I am indignant and dismayed by the Commission's intransigence to not want to repair the serious errors committed during the investigation process in respect of the applicant, and I am shocked by the respondent's stubborn refusal to not simply consent to judgment. It is clear that this application for judicial review should not have proceeded on the merits and that a satisfactory resolution for the applicant should have intervened in the meantime, long ago. Add to that the respondent's extreme position (whether or not on behalf of the Commission) on the issues of natural justice and procedural fairness."], ["[198]", "I cast no individual aspersions on counsel for the Department of Justice who acted in good faith in this case. They have a difficult and important task to accomplish and, at times, have to deal with difficult \"clients\". In particular, I would like to note the impeccable conduct of counsel for the respondent who argued before me. In every respect, counsel for the respondent accomplished a difficult task under the circumstances with professionalism and courtesy. In short, she was a true officer of the court. Therefore, my criticisms today are exclusively directed to \"the institution\", that is, the \"client\", who \"instructs\" its counsel."], ["[199]", "It goes without saying that the applicant cannot claim the fees and disbursements that were paid to her former counsel because they were not incurred on this application for judicial review. However, the fees and disbursement related to the preparation and presentation of the motion for production of documents that was dismissed by Prothonotary Tabib must be deducted. I am also of the opinion that a lump sum of $12,000 as costs is reasonable in this case, and given the comments mentioned above, they are payable forthwith to the applicant, after deducting the amount of $650 payable to the respondent, if that amount has not yet been paid by the applicant."], ["[200]", "In closing, I would like to thank counsel who appeared before me, and I hope that this painful affair for the parties involved, including the Commission, ends with this judgment, which will be final and binding upon the expiry of rights of appeal. Finally, to ensure that the systemic deficiencies or gaps-in investigative or adjudicative processes-outlined above are not the source of new injustices, I ask the Commission to be magnanimous and to, without delay, engage in reflection that should lead to a review of its practices in cases where it must determine whether fraud has occurred in an appointment process. Thank you for the attention you will give to these reasons.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[201]", "THE COURT DECLARES AND ORDERS", "1.

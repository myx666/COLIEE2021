Mr. Bailey stated his company's POM-POM trademark is used in Canada in association with POM-POM fruits by way of application of the Subject Mark to packaging for the wares. As Exhibit \"A\", he provided a specimen carton demonstrating the manner the trademark is used by his company in association with fresh citrus fruits in the Canadian marketplace.

In total, Mr. French has been employed by Sunkist for twenty-eight years. Mr. French explains that Sunkist is an agricultural cooperative whose membership is comprised of thousands of growers, packinghouses and regional marketing cooperative organization in California and Arizona. Sunkist assists with the distribution of the products of its members. Mr. French states that Orange Cove is a member of Sunkist and that he was asked to provide a representative sample of invoices confirming the sale of fresh citrus fruit sold in association with the Subject Mark in Canada during the Relevant Period. Attached as Exhibit \"A\" to Mr. French's Affidavit are numerous invoices which demonstrate that POM-POM fruits have been shipped to various Canadian purchasers during the Relevant Period. Some of these invoices are the same as were adduced by Mr. Bailey in the First Bailey Affidavit. Mr. French also states that Sunkist's assistance to members includes processing the placement of orders for members' produce, including POM-POM fruits, through Sunkist's Canadian sales offices. These transactions are processed through Sunkist's fresh fruit marketing system (FFM System) which is a computerized system for ordering, tracking and invoicing fresh fruit. Accordingly, although POM-POM fruits are shipped directly from Orange Cove's packinghouses to the relevant Canadian purchaser, Sunkist invoices the purchaser through the FFM System.

The new evidence simply confirms the role of Sunkist as an agricultural cooperative that assists its grower members with the sales and invoicing process. It explains the normal course of business and clarifies how invoices are issued by Sunkist on behalf of grower members such as Orange Cove. It also confirms that POM-POM fruits are shipped directly from the respondent's packinghouses to the relevant Canadian purchasers. It also touches incidentally the issue of use. Further, it includes a representative sample of invoices confirming the sale of fresh citrus fruits sold in association with the POM-POM registration in Canada during the Relevant Period.

The applicant raises essentially the same arguments in this appeal as were raised at the proof-of-use hearing. The applicant submits the evidence before the Registrar does not demonstrate use of the Subject Mark by Orange Cove during the Relevant Period. The applicant states that the specimen carton end or a photocopy of same, included as Exhibit \"A\" to the First and Second Bailey Affidavit, does not demonstrate the manner in which the Subject Mark is used in Canada. In this regard, the applicant argues that the respondent should have provided a photograph of a complete box or multiple boxes to prove the Subject Mark is used in the normal course of business. Moreover, counsel for the applicant stresses that the inscriptions appearing on the specimen carton are confusing and do not conclusively establish that the Subject Mark is used by the respondent. The applicant submits that none of the invoices included as Exhibit \"B\" to the First and Second Bailey Affidavit allow the Registrar to find a link between the Subject Mark and the respondent. Instead, according to the applicant, the evidence suggests that POM-POM is used in association with fresh citrus fruits by Sunkist and not Orange Cove. Moreover, there is a flagrant contradiction between what was stated in the Second Bailey Affidavit (that the notation ORANGE COVE CITR references the location of packing of the wares) and what was put forth by the respondent in its submissions to the Registrar (that the reference ORANGE COVE CITR represents the respondent). Finally, it is alleged that the Registrar erred by relying solely on", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 50 C.P.R.(4th) 45 (", "Desjardins", "), instead of looking at the specific facts involved in the case at bar.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "In spite of the arguments raised by the applicant's able counsel, I find that the Registrar's decision is reasonable in all respects and can stand up to a somewhat probing examination.

Indeed, it was reasonably open for the Registrar to find that the Subject Mark has been used by the respondent in the normal course of business. Photographs of a complete box or multiple boxes would have been helpful, but the lack of photographs, is not determinative, as I find that the production of a specimen carton and relevant invoices are conclusive evidence. Likewise, I agree with the respondent that there was no direct contradiction with respect to the significance of the notation: ORANGE COVE CITR. The First Bailey Affidavit lacked in specificity and the Second Bailey Affidavit merely clarified exactly how the notation refers to the respondent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "Indeed, the hearing officer was satisfied that when read fairly and as a whole, the evidence shows the use of the Subject Mark POM-POM in association with \"fresh citrus fruits\" during the Relevant Period by Orange Cove in a manner that complies with the requirements of s. 4 of the", "Act", ". The hearing officer was not persuaded by the arguments raised by the applicant regarding the ambiguity of the evidence. Although the applicant argued Mr. Bailey ought to have produced documents confirming the status of the registered owner as a member of Sunkist Growers, as well as a copy of the contract between Sunkist and Orange Cove, the hearing officer was of the opinion that such documents, while useful, were not necessary in these proceedings. The hearing officer noted that Mr. Bailey had sworn that Orange Cove is a grower member of Sunkist and that Sunkist assists in the distribution of the products of the grower members including the invoicing to the buyers on the members' behalf. Finding no reason to disbelieve Mr. Bailey's affidavit, the hearing officer accepted as a fact that Sunkist is not the user of the trademark but is merely acting as the registrant's agent or distributor with respect to the registered wares. I am unable to find any reviewable error made by the hearing officer in this regard.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "The hearing officer also noted the invoices appended to the First Bailey Affidavit confirmed the sale of the registrant's POM-POM fresh citrus fruits in Canada. Concerning the manner the Subject Mark was associated with the wares at the time of their transfer in the normal course of trade, the hearing officer emphasized that Mr. Bailey swore in his affidavit that the trademark is used in Canada with fresh citrus fruits by way of application of the Subject Mark to the packaging for the wares in the manner shown by Exhibit \"A\". Further, as Exhibit \"A\" clearly bears the Subject Mark and clearly refers to oranges which are fresh citrus fruits, the hearing officer reasonably concluded that at the time of the transfer of the wares to Orange Cove's Canadian purchasers (as listed in the affidavit and on the invoices), the trademark was linked to the wares in a manner satisfying the requirements of s. 4(1) of the", "Act", "during the Relevant Period. I also wish to stress that, in my opinion, the evidence brought by the respondent goes well beyond being a mere broad statement of use of the Subject Mark. I further note that the respondent furnished invoices which clearly confirm the sale of POM-POM brand fresh citrus fruits during the Relevant Period. Since the wares in packaging bearing the trademark are sold to the registrant's Canadian purchasers (mostly to grocery stores), such use is in the normal course of trade and is use complying with the requirements of the", "Act", ".

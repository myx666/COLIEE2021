The plaintiff Shibamoto & Company Ltd., through its agent Ocean Fisheries Limited, retained the services of the defendant Western Fish Producers Inc. and the Ship \"Nicolle N\" to carry out a joint \"cash fish buying\" operation in the Bristol Bay Salmon Fishery off the Coast of Alaska during the 1988 sockeye salmon season."], ["[2]", "On September 16, 1988 the plaintiffs commenced an action in this court by way of statement of claim seeking an award of damages for breach of contract by the defendants as well as wrongful seizure and conversion of the plaintiffs' property. The trial lasted twenty-six days and twenty-nine witnesses testified. In addition to the oral evidence, there were approximately 1,400 pages of documents filed on behalf of both parties. By judgment dated March 22, 1991, I held that the defendants had breached the agreement between the parties and the plaintiffs were accordingly entitled to damages for breach of contract. In addition, the defendant Jorn Nordmann, as well as all three defendant companies, were guilty of the tort of conversion. By order of the court, assessment of damages was to be determined at a later date."], ["[3]", "The matter pertaining to the assessment of damages was heard by me on June 10 and 11, 1991. The total amount of the plaintiffs' claim (without any consideration of costs) is $1,427,847.29. It is the plaintiffs' submission that the sum of $1,186,353 provided by the plaintiff Shibamoto pursuant to the agreement between the parties was in the defendants' possession at the time this cause of action arose. The monies were never returned to the plaintiffs and the court has found that it was converted by the defendants. The evidence at trial established that $250,000 was returned by the defendants to the plaintiffs on July 10, 1988 leaving a balance of $936,353 outstanding which has never been returned. In addition, it is admitted by the defendants in paragraphs 16, 17 and 50 of the agreed statement of facts, that $250,000 was advanced by the plaintiffs on the mortgage registered against the \"Nicolle N\". This amount was never repaid in full although the balance owing was reduced to $172,672.48 after Western's share of the profit from the sale of roe was applied towards the debt."], ["[4]", "The plaintiffs assert that the only deduction which should be made from the total monies wrongfully converted by the defendants is the amount of the profit share on the salmon to be paid to the defendants, which converted to U.S. dollars equals $48,665.73. Paragraph 6 of the plaintiffs' written submissions pertaining to damages states that:", "\"6. The profit share on the salmon payable to Western must be reduced by", "a) The commission payable to Ocean of 1.5% of F.O.B. value of fish actually shipped or $12,314.82;", "b) The adjustment from the tender advance of $.18 per round pound and $.25 per processed pound to the actual tendering cost of $.135 per round pound which amounts to $19,451.09;", "c) This leaves a net balance of the profit share of $16,899.82;", "d) Deducting this amount from the converted funds leaves a balance of $919,453.91.\""], ["[5]", "The plaintiffs claim a balance owing on the mortgage of $172,672.48 as well as interest on the converted monies ($919,453.91) in the amount of $335,720.90. This interest is calculated using the prime bank lending rate.

Once again it was argued during the course of the assessment hearing, as it was during the trial of this matter, that the plaintiff Shibamoto was not the true principal to the contract even though it was the party named in the agreement. Rather it was another, relatively insubstantial company called Muramoto, which did not have sufficient capital of its own to enter into the venture, but which exercised for its own benefit, the discretion given to the plaintiff Shibamoto pursuant to the contract. In the defendants' opinion, the agreement between the parties was a ruse since Shibamoto neither intended to purchase salmon and salmon roe for resale at a profit nor did it intend to divide those profits with Western. The participation of Muramoto, according to the defendants, was a fact which was never disclosed to them."], ["[7]", "It has been suggested by the defendants that the plaintiff Shibamoto did not use its best efforts to obtain the highest market price for the salmon or the salmon roe as it was required to do in accordance with paragraph 3.04 of the agreement and that it failed to take reasonable actions in order to mitigate its damages. The defendants contend the law is clear that the parties to a contract are under a duty to act reasonably in order to mitigate damages and may not recover for losses which could have been avoided had they acted in a more prudent manner."], ["[8]", "The defendants further argue that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover the costs of borrowing the money which it advanced to the defendants in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Those interest costs, it is argued, are not specifically identified in the agreement as being deductible. In paragraph 30 of its written submissions on damages, the defendants states that \"... Western was to provide the vessel and Shibamoto was to provide the money. Western is not entitled to deduct from profits its cost of purchasing the vessel and Shibamoto is not entitled to deduct the cost of borrowing the money.\""], ["[9]", "This court is also asked to find that the defendant Western Fish Producers Inc. is entitled to be compensated for its actual tendering costs which the plaintiffs were obligated to pay in accordance with the terms of the agreement. These costs were fixed in advance of the Bristol Bay season by virtue of the agreements between Western and its tenderers. The actual cost incurred by Western to secure tender vessels for the Bristol Bay salmon season was $235,000."], ["[10]", "The defendants argue that the contract rendered the plaintiff Shibamoto responsible for the payment of the fish tax imposed by the State of Alaska at the rate of 5.3% of the purchase price. Shibamoto, according to the defendants has not paid the tax in accordance with the agreement, with the result that the State of Alaska is now looking to Mr. Nordmann personally for payment of the tax. In the defendants' opinion it was and remains, Shibamoto's obligation to pay that tax."], ["[11]", "It is the defendants' position that they should not be required to bear the entire expense of the roe technicians, two of whom were hired for two and a half month terms and two of whom were hired for three month terms commencing June 16, 1988. It was expected that the Bristol Bay season would conclude July 20, 1988. As no further agreement with Western for the services of these people has ever been made, it is submitted that all costs connected with the technicians be prorated 35/90 in the case of the three month contracts and 35/75 in the case of the two month contracts."], ["[12]", "On the issue of the appropriate rate of interest, the defendants submit that, while an award of prejudgment interest would be proper in this case, the rate of such interest should not be the prime rate charged by commercial banks. The rate of interest must satisfy the principle of restitution in integrum. Since it is clear that prejudgment interest in maritime cases forms part of the damages, it follows that there must be some relationship between the interest rate claimed by the plaintiffs and the damages which they suffered. In this case, there is no evidence linking the prime rate of interest cited by the plaintiffs and their actual loss. According to the defendants, if the plaintiffs are awarded that rate of interest, they will obtain a recovery in excess of their actual losses. Similar reasoning is made in relation to postjudgment interest, which it is argued should be the current rate paid by the Royal Bank of Canada to its depositors so that the principle of restitutio in integrum is not offended."], ["[13]", "Finally, the defendants maintain that Western Fish Producers Inc. is entitled, in principle, to a credit equal to its share of the profit which was actually made or which should have been made on the sale of the salmon and salmon roe. In this regard, it is contended that the whole purpose of the assessment of damages was to determine the profit actually made or which should have been made. The method of doing this is to determine which costs were appropriately deductible from gross revenues."], ["[14]", "I have no hesitation in rejecting the defendants' contention that any losses created by the breach of contract were suffered by Muramoto and not the plaintiff Shibamoto and that the contract between the parties is somehow invalid because it was entered into under false pretences. This issue was canvassed extensively in the evidence at trial. At page 38 of my decision [43 F.T.R. 1, at p. 24] dated March 22, 1991, I dismissed this reasoning on the following grounds:", "\"I am not persuaded by these arguments. Shibamoto, the contractual party, is the plaintiff in this action ... The evidence clearly shows and it was understood at all times, that the contracting party would be Shibamoto & Co. Ltd. ... The funds provided to the defendants were the property of Shibamoto and the fish purchased by Western pursuant to the agreement were to be placed in the name of Ocean where they were to be held in trust for Shibamoto, until sold; it would at all times remain the property of Shibamoto. There is no doubt that all of this was understood by Mr. Nordmann when he entered into the contract.\""], ["[15]", "Furthermore, it is admitted by all parties in the agreed statement of facts that the monies which this court held to have been wrongfully converted by the defendants, was provided by and was the property of the plaintiff Shibamoto. The evidence before me at the hearing for assessment of damages clearly demonstrated that most of the expenses in connection with the salmon were paid by Shibamoto. While it is true that certain expenses, such as the supervisor's travelling costs from Japan to the \"Nicolle N\" and return trip were paid by Muramoto, this is, in my view entirely irrelevant to the question which I must determine. It is not necessary to ascertain who paid the various expenses which were necessarily incurred in order to realize whatever profit resulted. Indeed, such an inquiry is immaterial insofar as it relates to an assessment of damages."], ["[16]", "Neither am I persuaded by the defendants' suggestion that the plaintiffs failed to mitigate their damages or that Shibamoto did not fulfil its obligation to sell the salmon at the highest price possible. The onus of proving this allegation rests entirely with the defendants who provided no evidence to support their assertion that the total sales proceeds were lower than they should have been. On the other hand, the plaintiffs provided cogent evidence from Mr. Tashiro, Mr. Zoda and particularly Mr. Sugiyama, that the sales of the fish were handled in a manner fully in keeping with the terms and spirit of the agreement. Mr. Sugiyama, an individual with extensive experience in the industry, testified that he used his best efforts to obtain the highest price he could for the cargo considering its less than ideal condition, namely that the quality was not top calibre, there was physical damage to the fish, the grading of the fish was not accurate and there was chum mixed in with the salmon. Given the total lack of any evidence to the contrary, I can find no basis whatsoever to support a finding that the best sales price was not obtained."], ["[17]", "I turn now to the question of the roe technicians. I indicated during the course of the assessment hearing that I was not prepared to follow the course suggested by counsel for the plaintiffs and deduct the entire amount of the technicians wages and per diem allowance in establishing the profit. Paragraph 4.01 of the agreement provides that Shibamoto was to provide roe technicians who were to reside on the vessel throughout the season. Subsequent to the breach of contract by the defendants and the conversion of the plaintiff's money, the plaintiffs removed the technicians from the \"Nicolle N\". The evidence shows that Mr. Zoda could not convince Japanese technicians to come to Alaska to process roe without a minimum guarantee of two and a half to three months of employment and that subsequent to their removal from the vessel he attempted to find employment for them but failed. In light of the circumstances, it would be grossly unfair to attribute the entire expense of these people to the roe operation and deduct that whole amount from the defendants' share of the profit. I am satisfied that the total expenses incurred in connection with the roe technicians should be absorbed by the plaintiffs, who in my opinion, acted impetuously by removing these people from the vessel when there was work for them to do and potential profit still to be made."], ["[18]", "As far as the Alaska fish tax and the tendering costs are concerned, paragraphs 3.01 and 3.02 of the agreement provide as follows:", "\"3.01 Shibamoto shall pay the following items as set out below:", "(a) Eighteen ($0.18) Cents per round weight pound to Western for tendering costs payable on a daily basis when the salmon is offloaded to the tramper, upon receipt of both the mate's receipt and invoice from Western, based on fish ticket weight. The tender fee paid shall be adjusted to the actual cost of tendering the fish as soon as complete figures are available but in any event no later than July 29, 1988.", "(b) Alaska fish tax 5.3% percent of the purchase price, or such tax as is applicable, to the State of Alaska by July 29, 1988.", "\"3.02 Western and Shibamoto agree that after deducting all costs associated with handling and marketing commission of three (3%) percent, including but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, purchase price, tendering, processing, transportation, taxes, commissions (1% and 1.5%), insurance and marketing costs, the resulting net profit shall be divided equally between Shibamoto and Western or its nominee.\""], ["[19]", "Attached to the agreement is \"Schedule A\" which sets out, by way of example, how the fish tax and the tendering costs were to be included in the total price paid by the plaintiffs to Western Fish Producers Inc. There is no question, based upon the evidence proffered during the assessment hearing, that Western has been adequately recompensed for its tendering costs and the Alaska fish tax. I am not prepared to make any adjustments in these amounts either in favour of the plaintiffs or the defendants. Accordingly, I do not propose to grant the plaintiffs request and deduct the amount of $19,451.09 from Western's share of the profit. Neither am I willing to make an order that the defendants are entitled to be compensated for their actual tendering cost of $235,000."], ["[20]", "In the same manner, no order will be made pertaining to the Alaska fish tax. The defendants have been paid for this expense in accordance with the formula established in \"Schedule A\" to the agreement. I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have fulfilled their obligations pursuant to the agreement in this regard and cannot in any way be held liable for whatever outstanding amount may be owing."], ["[21]", "The next issue is the appropriate date of currency exchange. Section 12 of the", "Currency Act", ", R.S.C. 1985, c. C-52, provides that \"any reference to money or monetary value in any indictment or other legal proceedings shall be stated in the currency of Canada\". The Federal Court of Appeal, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , held that this section precludes the granting of judgments in Canada expressed in foreign currency. Accordingly, the court must then decide at what date the currency should be converted with the two options being the date of the breach of contract and the commission of the tort or the date of judgment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Supreme Court of Canada held that the conversion of foreign to Canadian funds must be done at the date of the breach of contract. Although some trial courts in Canada have expressed concern about the fairness of the date of breach rule, the Federal Court of Appeal has clearly stated in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a case involving a very substantial fluctuation in exchange rates, that it is not open to lower courts to change the rule adopted by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, in the case at bar the award of damages relating to the conversion claim must be in Canadian dollars and the date of conversion from U.S. to Canadian currency must be the date of the commission of the tort which took place between July 1 and July 3, 1988."], ["[22]", "With respect to the mortgage against the vessel \"Nicolle N\", the date of the conversion from U.S. to Canadian currency will be September 16, 1988, the date upon which the vessel was arrested."], ["[23]", "I accept the plaintiffs' submission that the security provided by the bail bond and the cash payment made into court by the surety in the amount of U.S. $1,300,000, should remain in U.S. funds until the money is ordered to be paid out.

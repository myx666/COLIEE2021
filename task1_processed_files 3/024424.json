To the extent that such an interpretation would depart from the ordinary meaning of 'basic pay', such departure is plausible given the context of the factual circumstances and is justified to meet the purposes of the PSSA.\""], ["[70]", "He referred to labour arbitration cases to establish the purpose of shift and week-end premiums in this case.

He then argues, in the present case, the entire operating employee compliment, being 90 or so percent of the bargaining unit, are required by the employer and the nature of their employment, to provide twenty-hour hour/365 days a year service to vessels in Canadian waters. Unlike almost all other workplaces, there is no \"down time\". He adds the compensation which the members of the bargaining unit receive in the", "form of shift and week-end premiums is directly related to the nature of the duties they perform.

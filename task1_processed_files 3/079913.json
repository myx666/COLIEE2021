By that reckoning, an investigation could go on indefinitely and the registrar would never have a duty to act. The difficulty lies essentially in the fact that there is no time limit provided in the", "Regulations", "for completing these inquiries. In fact, the source of the problem is a defective statutory framework. For one thing, the powers of the registrar to direct that an investigation be conducted in order to ascertain that the requirements of the", "Act", "have been met are not subject to any temporal or pragmatic parameters, apart from the obligation to await completion of the inquiries provided for in s. 11 of the", "Regulations", ", and for another, no time limits are placed on the powers of the investigators, in this instance CSIS.

In that case, processing had been delayed by investigations into the parties' bona fides. The court granted mandamus requiring that a decision be made, on the ground that the responsible authority had not adequately justified the delay.

Unless CSIS indicates otherwise as to the importance of confidentiality, procedural fairness demands that the registrar inform the applicant that an investigation is ongoing, delaying a decision on his citizenship application.

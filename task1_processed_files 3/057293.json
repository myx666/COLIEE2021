Her mother included an adopted child on her application for landing. The child is Youk Lay Lmouk, the Applicant's nephew, who was orphaned at the age of one when his parents were killed in 1986. The Applicant submitted proof that her nephew had been adopted by her mother in the form of a \"Certification of Adoption\" issued by the local administration in Cambodia.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "The Officer deleted Youk Lay Lmouk from his grandmother's application because she was not satisfied that the adoption was legally recognised in Cambodia. According to the Officer, the only acceptable proof of adoption for children not living in the orphanages in Cambodia is a judgment issued by the Municipal Court. Because there was insufficient evidence to prove that the adoption was legally recognised in Cambodia, the Applicant's nephew was found to be an ineligible applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "The letter dated September 25, 2001, in which the Officer communicated her decision to the Applicant's mother, a copy of which was sent to the Applicant, indicated that there was no right of appeal from the Officer's decision to the Board under section 77 of the", "Immigration Act", ", R.S.C. 1985, c.

The Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Decision Under Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "The Board gave the following reasons in support of its decision:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"The IAD can hear an appeal if it arises from the refusal of a sponsored application for permanent residence of a member of the family class. The member of the family class may include dependants in the application for landing. A 'dependant' is not a member of the family class unless the dependant also comes within the definition of 'member of the family class'. Where the application for landing made by the member of the family class has not been refused, and only the application for landing made by the alleged dependant has been refused the IAD has no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. A sponsor only has a right of appeal from the refusal of an application by a member of the family class not from the refusal to include in the application an alleged dependant of such a member.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"In this case the sponsor's nephew was deleted from the application of the sponsor's mother as he was found by the visa officer to be an ineligible applicant who is claimed to be a dependent (sic). According to the respondent no decision has yet been taken by Canadian immigration officials respecting the application of the sponsor's mother.

The Officer gave the following examples:", "Rent and work", ": There were discrepancies as to how the Applicant paid her rent from 2006-2009, before the marriage, and whether the Applicant worked from 2009-2013. The Applicant said she did not pay any rent to her landlord before her spouse moved in with her in 2009, but that after he moved in, he paid $650 per month in rent. Prior to 2009, she provided cleaning services for her landlord in exchange for free rent; after 2009, she continued to work for her landlord, and the landlord paid her for her work after her husband began paying rent. However, the sponsor said that before he moved in, the Applicant paid rent with help from friends in Hong Kong. He said his wife only worked for the landlord in 2011. When confronted with this discrepancy, the Applicant said she had worked starting in 2006 until 2013, but did not want to tell her husband.

The Applicant first said that her husband had the day off, and they stayed home all day. By contrast, the sponsor said he went to see his children from a previous marriage for an hour or two.

The Applicant says she found out it was a bawdy house at the previous interview in 2012. She said she felt safe there but her husband felt it was dangerous for her to be alone there during the day. By contrast, the sponsor said he felt the house was safe; they moved out simply for pricing and location reasons. He said he did not believe it was a bawdy house at all, he believed it was merely a massage parlour.

Regarding the sponsor's activities of Tuesday October 8, the Applicant explains in her affidavit that in Chinese culture it is not customary to discuss one's previous marriage with one's current spouse, and this is why her husband seldom discusses his children from his previous marriage. When finding the Applicant's explanation unreasonable, the Officer failed to consider the cultural context.

For example, the sponsor's apparent lack of knowledge that his former residence was allegedly a bawdy house - after being told this fact at the previous interview in 2012 - completely undermines his credibility, and is irreconcilable with his wife's account that he felt the residence was not safe. Similarly, their contradictory answers with respect to the Applicant's sources of income greatly undermine their credibility and cast doubt on the genuineness of the relationship. As conceded by counsel for the Applicant, her explanation as to her not knowing that her husband had left the house for a couple of hours to meet with his children was not a very strong argument either."], ["[24]", "When considered as a whole, the Officer's assessment of the interview is reasonable. While there were some answers that were consistent, others were clearly inconsistent. On the one hand, there are a number of answers that were consistent, such as when and where they met, the day the Applicant met the sponsor's children, and the Applicant's ill health. However, in addition to the three major discrepancies described in the Officer's decision, the Officer noted other minor discrepancies in her Interview Notes. For example, when asked which restaurant they went to on their last outing, they both answered that they went out for dim sum for lunch for the sponsor's birthday, but gave different restaurant names. They also gave inconsistent answers as to whether the sponsor's parents are employed, and whether the sponsor ate with the Applicant on the one and only day she visited the restaurant where he works. Given this mixed bag of consistency and inconsistency, in my view the Officer's conclusions about the interview are reasonable in light of the Interview Notes in the record."], ["[25]", "The observations regarding the sponsor's demeanour are also reasonable. As this Court has often recognized, the Officer is in the best position to make a finding on credibility because she is able to observe the parties' demeanour. The Applicant's argument about taking the cultural context into account when assessing the genuineness of the marriage is inapposite: the Officer was not commenting on the sponsor's demeanour in relation to the level of affection for his wife, but rather in assessing his credibility when confronted with a discrepancy. In her Interview Notes, the Officer noted in several places - all of which were moments when he was confronted with a discrepancy - that he \"does not look at [the Applicant] \", \"is avoiding eye contact\", and \"appears sullen\". While it is true that the Officer is required to take cultural norms into account when assessing the genuineness of the marriage, the Officer's observations were directed more to the credibility of the sponsor's answers when confronted with discrepancies than to the genuineness of the relationship itself. Since the Officer is charged with assessing demeanour at the interview, these observations are owed deference."], ["[26]", "It was reasonable to conclude that there is little evidence to support their cohabitation at their new residence on Rowe Court in Markham. The only evidence is the driver's license address change: the Applicant submitted her driver's license with the new Markham address, and the sponsor submitted a \"Change of Address Confirmation\" form, showing he applied for a change of address for his driver's license. However, there are no further documents provided: no lease or bills for that address in either the Applicant's or the sponsor's name. Although they had allegedly lived at that address for only about 6 months at the time of the interview, in my view, the Officer could reasonably conclude that there was little evidence of their cohabitation in Markham."], ["[27]", "It is no doubt true that the Officer based her decision mostly on the interview and did not discuss much of the documentary evidence, but this goes to the weighing of the evidence. The Officer does not discuss any of the supporting documents submitted with the application (i.e. tax returns, bills, rent and phone bills, photos, employment letters, and other identification), other than to list them. The Officer does note that there is little information to support their cohabitation in Markham, which is reasonable, but the Officer does not discuss the evidence that substantiates their alleged cohabitation at their prior address from 2010 to 2013. However, this is acceptable in light of", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, and of the presumption that the Officer has taken all the evidence into account.

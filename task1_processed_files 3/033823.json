While this ordeal deals with the same GST debt owed by him, the actions taken by the CRA were separate and distinct. The Pacesetter RFI is a different action than registering or re-activating his GST account. Moreover, Mr. McCartie himself has filed separate judicial reviews in this alleged continuing course of conduct in 2010 and 2011. The first application was dismissed and the second was withdrawn.

The search for accommodation is a multi-party inquiry. Along with the employer and the union, there is also a duty on the complainant to assist in securing an appropriate accommodation ...", ". . . . .", "\"Thus in determining whether the duty of accommodation has been fulfilled the conduct of the complainant must be considered ...\""], ["[70]", "Further at paragraph 44 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, Mr. Justice Sopinka states:", "\"[...] [w]hile the complainant may be in a position to make suggestions, the employer is in the best position to determine how the complainant can be accommodated ...\""], ["[71]", "The third finding was that the respondent has suggested other accommodations for the applicant for the interview portion but the applicant has refused these options without suggesting alternatives because the applicant believes any measure of social skill assessment is discriminatory."], ["[72]", "The respondent submits that the applicant was not only offered accommodation for the interview portion of the hiring process but also afterwards as the parties sought to resolve the complaint. However, the difficulty with the respondent's position and ultimately the Commission's related conclusions is that the accommodations that were put on the table for the applicant always involved an evaluation of her social skill set, which is the very thing she needed accommodation for and what the applicant, who best knows her limitations, felt discriminated against her, and ultimately excluded her from employment."], ["[73]", "The respondent claimed that they could not accommodate in this respect for two reasons. One, they claimed that agreements with the union meant that the applicant would be eligible to apply for other positions solely based on seniority; other positions that could demand social skill sets beyond that of the position originally applied for. And two, the respondent stated that the internal position, where the applicant hoped to work, demanded social skills with co-workers and supervisors."], ["[74]", "The applicant is right to point out that the explanations by Canada Post of collective agreements and generalized practices are not in keeping with the developing jurisprudence on accommodations, for example at paragraph 24 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above:", "\"... In both instances private arrangements, whether by contract or collective agreement, must give way to the requirements of the [human rights] statute. In the case of direct discrimination which is not justified under the", "Act", ", the whole of the provision is invalid because its purpose as well as effect is to discriminate on a prohibited ground. Thus, in", "Etobicoke", ", a provision in the collective agreement, which required firefighters to retire at age 60, could not be applied because in all of its applications it discriminated by its very terms on the basis of age. This discriminatory effect could not be justified as a BFOR.", "\"25. On the other hand a provision such as the one in this case is neutral on its face but operates in a discriminatory fashion against the appellant. The provision is valid in its general application. What the human rights legislation requires is that the appellant be accommodated by exempting him from its provisions to the extent that it no longer discriminates against him on the basis of his religion. To suggest that the provision must be applied to include the appellant within its terms is to allow the employer and the union to contract out of the requirements of the", "Human Rights Act", ". This they cannot do. This does not mean that the collective agreement cannot contain a formula for the accommodation of the religious beliefs of employees. An employer who avails himself of such a general provision must, however, establish that it complies [page 987] with the duty to accommodate. See", "Central Alberta Dairy Pool", ", at p. 528.", "\"26. While the provisions of a collective agreement cannot absolve the parties from the duty to accommodate, the effect of the agreement is relevant in assessing the degree of hardship occasioned by interference with the terms thereof. Substantial departure from the normal operation of the conditions and terms of employment in the collective agreement may constitute undue interference in the operation of the employer's business.\""], ["[75]", "Although <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, involved accommodations based on religious belief, I do not see a good reason for Canada Post not to have followed the same principles in the hiring of the applicant. At the minimum, a discussion about altering the term of the collective agreement for the applicant was reasonable and was not done. The investigation and ultimate Commission decision failed to identify the interrelationship between meeting the obligations of collective agreements and accommodating an individual like Ms. Davidson to be in accordance with human rights legislation."], ["[76] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 36, discussed how unions can become complicit in discrimination when \"it may cause or contribute to the discrimination in the first instance by participating in the formulation of the work rule that has the discriminatory effect on the complainant\". At paragraph 39, Mr. Justice Sopinka continues:", "\"A union which is liable as a co-discriminator with the employer shares a joint responsibility with the employer to seek to accommodate the employee. If nothing is done both are equally liable. Nevertheless, account must be taken of the fact that ordinarily the employer, who has charge of the workplace, will be in the better position to formulate accommodations. The employer, therefore, can be expected to initiate the process.\""], ["[77]", "The fact that there are clauses in the collective agreement that allow workers, once hired, to apply for other positions based on seniority does not mean that the applicant, who faces significant barriers in our society in getting hired, should be precluded from a position which she ultimately is well suited for because it does not have the social interactions that other positions often demand. Canada Post may be required to alter their collective agreements as an equity seeking employer. I acknowledge that there are distinguishing factors with the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, decision. Accommodating religious belief does not involve actual aptitudes of employment as is the case here. However, this issue, which was raised by the applicant, is an important one. I find it unreasonable that the Commission was willing to accept that the strict rules within the CUPW bargaining unit were acceptable and rationally connected to the position of postal clerk despite the potential for the \"rules\" to supersede the applicant's human rights. The Commission wrote as follows at page 5 of its decision:", "\"The respondent states that the interchangeability of jobs within the CUPW bargaining unit and the strict rules surrounding the filling of permanent positions from the pool of temporary employees means that the interview is critical in ensuring that it recruits only qualified candidates for the temporary call-in positions.\""], ["[78]", "The concept of accommodating up to undue hardship has been adopted in the context of employee-employer relations. It may also be necessary to consider whether the negotiations with the union and management that would facilitate this would actually constitute undue hardship in accordance with", "Meorin", "above. In", "Meiorin", "above, the Court found that the respondent had not established that its aerobic performance standards were necessary for the safe and efficient performance of the job of a forest firefighter and as such were discriminatory."], ["[79]", "The respondent has argued in turn that even an internal position demands social skills as an employee navigates their relationship with co-workers and management. However, the investigator never considered that Canada Post employees could receive sensitivity training and knowledge to assist the successful employment of the applicant. As well, the applicant points out that this position is uniquely suited for her as it has solitude, structure, monotony and consistency which many other people may find challenging. In other words, the applicant's disposition and disability is not a deficit per se but a range of skills and aptitudes while different than the non-Asperger Syndrome population are still valuable in positions such as this, nonetheless. The", "Dawson", "case above, specifically is critical of rigid corporate rules that preclude true inclusiveness of those with disabilities such as the applicant's."], ["[80]", "The respondent has also argued that it was the applicant's lack of experience and not her social skill set that ultimately led to the rejection of her application. However, again, if Canada Post had truly been alive to her situation as an equity seeking individual, they may have considered that the applicant may have been precluded from other jobs by way of her disability. That said, the applicant suggests that she is not applying for a position where she is unsuited and ill-prepared. She was an honour roll student in high school and is now in first year sciences at university."], ["[81]", "The fourth finding by the Commission was that the respondent acknowledged that it used situational questions during the interviews for inside and outside postal workers but were flexible in considering other options. I am somewhat puzzled by this finding given that the concerns regarding the collective agreement provisions for advancement based on seniority were never resolved. The respondent could not have argued this position if they were truly attempting to accommodate beyond their social skill set competencies and did remain part of the investigator's decision."], ["[82]", "In", "Bastide", "above, sufficient accommodation is discussed at paragraph 48 in part:", "\"It is true that individualized assessment does not always constitute sufficient accommodation. The assessment must also assess the person based on a realistic standard that reflects his or her true capacities and his or her potential contribution.\""], ["[83]", "The fifth issue was in regards to the Commission's findings that the applicant was unable and/or unwilling to participate in the process of finding suitable accommodation with Canada Post. The jurisprudence is such that there is a duty on the applicant to facilitate the search for an accommodation (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above) quoted from", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 327 F.T.R. 253 (F.C.)."], ["[84]", "I acknowledge the problems that the Commission identified in the process of endeavouring to find a suitable accommodation. However, this process was surely not meant to coerce a complainant into accepting an accommodation that did not provide a genuine solution to the discriminatory practice and accepting a process that was not reflective of the kind of evaluation in hiring suited to someone like Ms. Davidson. It was unreasonable for the investigator not to identify the fundamental problems with the respondent's offers of accommodation. As long as Canada Post refused to evaluate the applicant in relation to her disability in respect to the interview criteria, and without the supposed stranglehold of union rules, the applicant felt that the substance of the complaint had been missed entirely which made her reluctant to participate."], ["[85]", "It is also understandable that the applicant was finding it difficult to engage in the accommodations process. Issues like refusing to drop the outside worker evaluation appeared to lead Ms. Davison to believe that Canada Post did not fully appreciate her limitations to interact with the public. Canada Post is an equity seeking employer with the infrastructure and resources to provide a supportive work environment. As well, the applicant has a familiarity with the company because her parents are long term employees of Canada Post. Further, and most critically, the job tasks are uniquely favourable to someone with Asperger Syndrome for their repetitiveness, consistency, and lack of demand socially. The applicant must have felt that she was sure to fail as Canada Post and the Commission did not appear to be alive to the changes that may have been necessary to provide true equity through accommodation for Ms. Davidson."], ["[86]", "The other aspect of this duty is the obligation to accept reasonable accommodation. This is the aspect referred to by Mr. Justice McIntyre in", "Human Rights Commission (Ont.) and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 241. The complainant cannot expect a perfect solution. If a proposal that would be reasonable in all the circumstances is turned down, the employer's duty is discharged. The investigator stated:", "\"It is important to note that the duty to accommodate is not limitless. The respondent's obligation is to make a genuine effort to accommodate the complainant. The evidence indicates that the respondent has made such an effort, and remains open to considering other accommodation options. The complainant, however, must also cooperate to facilitate the accommodation process.\""], ["[87]", "I am not of the view that the applicant should be faulted for refusing the offers of accommodations offered to her. In this case, the concept of accommodation is not necessarily lessening the demands of meeting a certain standard: it may mean changing the standard altogether which is what the applicant maintained was essential for her to be treated equally according to human rights standards. I am not confident from the respondent's submissions or the investigator's report that this notion was ever fully canvassed. I am further of the view that this kind of accommodation in the context of Asperger Syndrome, presents challenges for employers. Jurisprudentially, the old principles of what makes up accommodations are not easily applied. However, the principles behind the", "Act", "are constructive."], ["[88]", "I conclude with an analysis of subsection 44(3) of the", "Act", "and the purpose of the inquiry. Because the inquiry is not a tribunal hearing, the Court must review the decision in this step of the process, accordingly."], ["[89]", "The respondent argues that the Court's ability to review the decision does not go beyond a duty of fairness analysis as there is an administrative dimension to the inquiry. Whether there was actually discrimination, for example, is beyond the Commission's mandate and as such, it cannot be the determining factor as to whether the decision was unreasonable (see", "Bastide", "above). The respondent is correct in pointing out that the Commission has a mandate that is multi-faceted involving the greater public interest and efficient use of resources and time, to name a few. The Supreme Court of Canada has even called the first stage of the process before a hearing \"a purely administrative decision\" (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above). It is the totality of the evidence that is important (see", "Wang", "above). Given these parameters, I am still of the view that the manner in which the evidence was considered was outside of the justified and intelligible outcomes that make up a reasonable decision under <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above."], ["[90]", "In my analysis of this issue, I am not tasked with determining whether discrimination did in fact occur but rather, if the Commission erred in making its decision that there was no basis for a further inquiry. Deference is also owed because of the Commission's interests in maintaining a \"workable and administratively effective system\" (see", "Slattery", "above quoted from", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 161 F.T.R. 34 (T.D.)). Having said this, it must be acknowledged that this evaluation cannot be done without some attention paid to the merits of the discrimination case."], ["[91]", "Slattery", "above, states:", "\"Subsection 44(3) does not allow the CHRC to completely divorce such decisions from the merits of the complaint. If purely administrative considerations (i.e. cost, time) were allowed to prevail, it is conceivable that a person's entitlement to relief under human rights legislation would be dependent on the ease of proving human rights violations. Such an approach would be inconsistent with the justice-based purpose of the", "Act", "of giving effect to the principle of equal opportunity. Administrative agencies must, in exercising discretionary power, pursue purposes that in no way offend the spirit of the enabling statute. On the other hand, the applicant's submission, that judicial review of the exercise of discretion is warranted for CHRC dismissals of complaints each time that, in the opinion of the reviewing court, the complainant took his case out of the realm of conjecture, went too far the other way. Deference must prevail over interventionism insofar as the CHRC deals with matters of fact-finding and adjudication, particularly with respect to matters over which the CHRC has been vested with such wide discretion, as in the case of the decision whether or not to dismiss a complaint pursuant to subsection 44(3). As the power vested in the CHRC by subsection 44(3) is discretionary, a court should not interfere merely because it might have exercised the discretion differently.\""], ["[92]", "In", "Slattery", "above, the content of procedural fairness required in Commission investigations according to the statutory requirement of thoroughness was stated:", "\"Deference must be given to administrative decision-makers to assess the probative value of the evidence and to decide to further investigate or not to further investigate accordingly. It should only be where unreasonable omissions are made, for example where an investigator failed to investigate obviously crucial evidence, that judicial review is warranted.\""], ["[93]", "I note that the", "Dawson", "above decision by the Commission makes several important findings salient to the issues at hand. This case was decided after the Commission's decision to dismiss the complaint and as such, was notbefore the Commission when deciding Ms. Davidson's complaint. I do not find it necessary to support the findings, however, the issues resonate: Canada Post had limited experience dealing with persons with Asperger Syndrome; Canada Post had to learn to adapt to the thought process and abilities of a person with Asperger Syndrome or discrimination would invariably occur; unless employees at Canada Post are well educated on the disability, a lack of sensitivity will exist and thereby sabotage any assurance by the autistic individual that their disability is being treated appropriately."], ["[94]", "Chief Justice Dickson in", "Action Travail des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  spoke to the manner in which human rights legislation should be interpreted:", "\"24.

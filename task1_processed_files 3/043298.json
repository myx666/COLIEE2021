Nowhere does the RPD appear alive to or acknowledge that it is the refugee claimant who has the legal burden to rebut the presumption of state protection. Nowhere does the RPD recognize that a claimant may only rebut the presumption of state protection with \"clear and convincing evidence\". The RPD said nothing about the nature of state protection or what exactly it is, i.e., operational adequacy. Its only comment on state protection is the bare conclusion that \"there is a demonstrable failure of State Protection\". The RPD provided no reasons or analysis as to its analytical process or why it found a failure of state protection, let alone how it concluded there was \"demonstrable\" failure of state protection.

Second, the request as I see it asks the Court in effect to \"fill in\" the reasons with those parts of the record favourable to the Respondents. But even if there is evidence on which if accepted the RPD could find that the presumption of state protection was successfully rebutted, its acceptance by this Court would by implication require both the balancing and rejection of the other conflicting evidence. And then there is the testimony of the Respondents which is for the panel, not the Court to assess in combination with the documentary record. The RPD has many advantages not available to a reviewing court in the assessment of evidence before it.

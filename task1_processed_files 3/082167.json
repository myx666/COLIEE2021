The affidavit of an investigator hired by Patou affirmed that one individual, when responding to a telephone query, disclosed that she sold Luxo's \"Booster\" products only after being prompted by a supplementary request for \"Canadian Booster\" products. Even if this hearsay evidence were admissible, it is anecdotal and is limited to the experience of one person. As such, it is not sufficient to establish that the word \"booster\" is clearly descriptive."], ["[18]", "Patou also provided a direct statement from an individual who sells \"Curl Booster\" but not Luxo's products. This statement is no more relevant to the issue of \"clearly descriptive\" than is the list of almost 50 registered marks containing the word \"booster\". \"Booster\" has been disclaimed in approximately 10 of these registrations and only once in the beauty product industry: \"Avon Collagen Booster\". In that instance, \"Booster\" is used as the nominative form of the verb \"to boost\" to describe what the Avon product will do in a generic or descriptive sense. In the case of Luxo's registration, there is no evidence that \"Booster\" describes the action of any of its products. The mark, therefore, is not used in a descriptive manner."], ["[19]", "Finally, the dictionary entries introduced by the parties do not define \"booster\" in relation to hair products."], ["[20]", "In summary, while \"Booster\" may be a weak mark, as evidenced by the number of current registrations, I cannot conclude that the word is clearly descriptive. This finding is consistent with Patou's own decision to seek its registration of the trademark \"Booster\" and its failure to voluntarily disclaim \"Booster\" in its subsequent application to register \"Jean Patou Booster\" and Design.", "ii) Is The Trademark \"Booster\" Distinctive Of The Wares Sold By Luxo Or Those Of The Original Registrant, The Canadian Booster Company, Limited?"], ["[21]", "The definition of \"trademark\" [see footnote 7] has two principal components: the mark must be \"used\" by its owner; and, it must distinguish the goods or services of its owner, be they \"manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed\", from the goods or services of others. According to this definition, the registrant of a trademark may be, like the respondent in this case, a manufacturer or a seller of the wares associated with the mark. [see footnote 8] The", "Act", "also sets out the definitions of \"distinctive\", \"use\" and \"deemed use\" as follows:", "\"'distinctive', in relation to a trademark, means a trademark that actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others or is adapted so to distinguish them;", ". . . . .", "\"'use', in relation to a trademark, means any use that by s. 4 is deemed to be a use in association with wares or services;", ". . . . .", "When deemed to be used", "\"4(1) A trademark is deemed to be used in association with wares if, at the time of the transfer of the property in or possession of the wares, in the normal course of trade, it is marked on the wares themselves or on the packages in which they are distributed or it is in any other manner so associated with the wares that notice of the association is then given to the person to whom the property or possession is transferred.\""], ["[22]", "In support of its submissions that \"Booster\" is not distinctive of the products marketed by Luxo, Patou argues that \"Booster\" does not distinguish Luxo's wares from those of others because its name does not appear on the label of the products associated with the mark. The resulting public perception is that Luxo is not the source of the goods associated with the trademark \"Booster\" but a mere distributor of those wares. Any benefit or good will arising from the use of the mark has, therefore, accrued to the benefit of The Canadian Booster Company, Limited and not to its successor in title Luxo. Accordingly, Patou argues, the trademark does not distinguish the wares sold by Luxo within the meaning of \"distinctive\" set out in s. 2 of the", "Trade-marks Act"], ["[23]", "Patou referred to several cases in which a trademark was held to be invalid after it was assigned by the original registrant to a subsidiary or distributor.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Canadian registration of its trademark to its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary.

The public cannot be misled into thinking that the product it is purchasing today originates in a company that was dissolved 22 years ago."], ["[25]", "Patou argues forcefully that Luxo's name appears on none of its labels. From this, Patou urges that the trademark \"Booster\" is distinctive of the wares of The Canadian Booster Company, Limited and not those of Luxo. The labels attached to \"Booster\" products include this information:", "The Canadian Booster Company", "Toronto, Canada M5G 1C3", "Made in Canada"], ["[26]", "Firstly, there is nothing in the definition of \"distinctive\", or in s. 4(1), that requires the registered owner of a trademark to identify itself on the label of the products with which it associates its trademark. It is sufficient that the registered owner establish that its trademark is identified on, and associated", "only", "with, its wares at the time of the transfer to the customer. There is no evidence in this case of a second source of \"Booster\" products."], ["[27]", "Secondly, Luxo's use of \"The Canadian Booster Company\" reflects Luxo's own registration of that trade name in December 1995. [see footnote 11] The postal code used on the labels of \"Booster\" products includes the location of Luxo's premises. This information accurately represents, upon verification of the appropriate trade name register if necessary, the current ownership of the trademark. Patou has proffered no evidence of public deception or confusion arising from the similarity between Luxo's registered trading style and the name of a company that has not existed for over two decades."], ["[28]", "The facts of this case are also distinguishable from those found in", "Heintzman v. 751056 Ontario Ltd. et al.", ", [see footnote 12] where the assignee sold foreign-made pianos marked with the Heintzmann name and of an apparently inferior quality. Justice Reed found that: \"Not only were the efforts to notify the public virtually non-existent, there was clearly a deliberate attempt by the respondents to camouflage the fact that a change of source had occurred.\" I have not understood the relevance of", "Heintzmann", "to this case. There is no evidence of any difference in the quality between the products marketed by Luxo and those sold by the original registrant; nor is there evidence of other entities marketing products under the same trademark in the marketplace."], ["[29]", "Patou has also failed to establish that Luxo is perceived by consumers as a mere distributor of the products of The Canadian Booster Company, Limited. Again, this corporate entity has not existed for over 20 years. The affidavit of Patou's investigator suggesting that [TRANSLATION] \"the 'Booster' or 'Canadian Booster' products appear to be manufactured by Canadian Booster Company\" can only reflect an uninformed perusal of Luxo's product labels and nothing more. The evidence discloses no other source for Luxo's products. There is no evidence of consumer deception or of the existence of a multiplicity of sources."], ["[30]", "Even if the respondent were a mere distributor, the trademark \"Booster\" is registrable by it as long as it is distinctive of its wares.

Luxo, is the sole entity benefiting from the use of the \"Booster\" trademark."], ["[31]", "In summary, Patou has not established that the mark \"Booster\" is distinctive of the wares of an entity other than Luxo.

The party asserting abandonment must prove both actual non-use of the mark and an intent, on the part of the registered owner, to abandon the mark. [see footnote 15] The jurisprudence recognizes that proof of non-use may be made where a trademark owner's use of its mark deviates from the registered form of the mark. [see footnote 16] In this case, Patou argues that Luxo and its predecessors in title have abandoned their mark through the continued use of the trademark \"Booster\" with the adjective \"Canadian\" and with what appears to be a stylized tiger-head graphic. Patou claims that this style of usage has resulted in the creation of a composite mark, namely, \"Canadian Booster\" and Design."], ["[33]", "There is no graphic associated with the trademark \"Booster\" as registered. The labels show that Luxo frequently, but not consistently, uses \"Booster\" in combination with the word \"Canadian\" and with a graphic representation. Even so, \"Booster\" is the dominant word on the labels. It is printed across the label in a stylized font that is significantly larger than any other word or graphic on the label. The word \"Canadian\" is generally found above the word \"Booster\" in a much smaller font. The tiger's head appears in the upper area of the label. Two different depictions of the tiger head are found on the labels. One version is more realistic and is larger in size while the other is smaller and more stylized."], ["[34]", "Patou relies on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in", "Compagnie Internationale pour l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  three registered trademarks: \"CII, Honeywell\" and \"Bull\".

Patou has thus failed to demonstrate that, at the material date, the trademark \"Booster\" had lost its identity through association either with the word \"Canadian\" or with the tiger-head graphic.

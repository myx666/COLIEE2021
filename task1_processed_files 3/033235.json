The general principle applies when the decision of the court will not have the effect of resolving some controversy which affects or may affect the rights of the parties. If the decision of the court will have no practical effect on such rights, the court will decline to decide the case. This essential ingredient must be present not only when the action or proceeding is commenced but at the time when the court is called upon to reach a decision. Accordingly if, subsequent to the initiation of the action or proceeding, events occur which affect the relationship of the parties so that no present live controversy exists which affects the rights of the parties, the case is said to be moot. The general policy or practice is enforced in moot cases unless the court exercises its discretion to depart from its policy or practice. The relevant factors relating to the exercise of the court's discretion are discussed hereinafter.", "16 The approach in recent cases involves a two-step analysis. First it is necessary to determine whether the required tangible and concrete dispute has disappeared and the issues have become academic. Second, if the response to the first question is affirmative, it is necessary to decide if the court should exercise its discretion to hear the case. The cases do not always make it clear whether the term \"moot\" applies to cases that do not present a concrete controversy or whether the term applies only to such of those cases as the court declines to hear. In the interest of clarity, I consider that a case is moot if it fails to meet the \"live controversy\" test.

And, as the Applicant notes, a TPM was appointed and he did, in fact, administer the AFN's funds between December 5, 2011 and April 19, 2012.

However, the fact that the Minister's broad statutory power is a delegation of the contractual capacity of the Crown as a corporation sole, and that its exercise by the Minister involves considerable discretion and is governed in large part by the private law of contract, may limit the circumstances in which the Court should grant relief on an application for judicial review challenging the legality of the award of a contract."], ["[53]", "On the issue of whether the appellants in that case had a right to procedural fairness arising from the common law in respect of administrative action, the Court of Appeal explained:", "46 The context of the present dispute is essentially commercial, despite the fact that the Government is the purchaser.

This harks back to the time before the Bill of Rights of 1689 where the Crown reserved the right to interpret and apply Parliament's laws to suit its own policy objectives. It would take a very explicit grant of authority from Parliament in order for this Court to reach such a far-reaching conclusion.", "99 The issues in this appeal concern the interpretation of a statute by a minister who is not acting as an adjudicator and who thus has no implicit power to decide questions of law. Of course, the Minister must take a view on what the statute means in order to act. But this is not the same as having a power delegated by Parliament to decide questions of law. The presumption of deference resulting from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , which was reiterated in", "Alberta Teachers' Association", "at paras. 34 and 41, does not extend to these circumstances. The standard of review analysis set out at paragraphs 63 and 64 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> must thus be carried out in the circumstances of this case in order to ascertain Parliament's intent."], ["[66]", "After conducting a standard of review analysis, the Court of Appeal ultimately determined that the issues of statutory interpretation raised by the appeal should be reviewed on a standard of correctness."], ["[67]", "In this case, it is similarly the Minister's interpretation, albeit of an agreement and not a statute, that is at issue, not that of an adjudicative tribunal. As noted in", "David  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , while the Minister must \"take a view\" on what particular provisions of the CFA mean in order to act, this is not the same as having a power delegated by Parliament to decide questions of law. In light of the fact that the question at issue is a question of law, that the Minister acts in an administrative capacity, and not as an adjudicator, and that the Minister does not have expertise in the interpretation of contracts, the standard of correctness is applicable."], ["[68]", "On the second issue - of the choice of remedy, the parties agree and I would concur that the applicable standard of review is reasonableness (see, for example,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 202;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 126).", "C.", "Did the Minister err in his interpretation of the CFA?"], ["[69]", "The Applicant alleges that the correct interpretation of s 9.1(d) of the CFA requires that the risk of compromise to the health, safety or welfare of AFN members be", "caused", "by some action, or failure to act, attributable to the Council before the Council can be found to be in default and the Minister can invoke the remedy of appointing a TPM.

Rather, the provision is clear that once the Minister is reasonably of the opinion that the health, safety or welfare of members of the AFN is at risk of being compromised, the Council can be found to be in default of the CFA. The Court agrees with the Respondent that s 9.1(d) functions as a deeming provision."], ["[72]", "The Applicant equates \"default\" with \"fault\" where the two words are not synonymous.

While the AFN were having trouble addressing the housing crisis, what they lacked was not the ability to manage their finances, in which case a TPM may have been an appropriate and reasonable remedy, but the material means to do so."], ["[79]", "Indeed, when AANDC officials visited the AFN reserve on November 28, 2011, Chief Spence explained that the Band had not invoked its Emergency Plan because it lacked the necessary equipment, for example, cots, blankets and other supplies and they requested assistance to work on their plan and obtain the necessary equipment."], ["[80]", "The AFN had also been able to identify nine homes which could be renovated, with five earmarked for those families living in tent frames. At the time that AANDC officials visited the reserve, the AFN were awaiting final quotes and planned to be able to start working on the houses before Christmas with move-in by the middle of January. The AFN was also in the process of developing their second funding proposal for the remaining homes."], ["[81]", "Throughout this process and the period leading up to the appointment of the TPM, AANDC did not express any concern with the AFN's financial management. Indeed, there was little in the way of any contemporaneous notes in the record showing how the ADM arrived at his decision to appoint a TPM at all. However, rather than provide material assistance to help the AFN remedy any alleged default, the ADM instead opted to appoint a TPM, whose expertise is financial in nature."], ["[82]", "The Court has already referred to the ADM's concentration on the level of intervention rising from co-management to TPM rather than focusing on the range of remedies available. The concentration on internal policies detracted from the attention to be paid to the remedies under the CFA."], ["[83]", "One of the factors relied upon by the ADM in appointing a TPM was the supposed \"failure of the First Nation to accurately identify how many and which members were in need of assistance, as demonstrated by the late identification of 17 families in need of assistance\" (paragraph 54 of ADM's Affidavit)."], ["[84]", "The ADM failed to appreciate that there was no failure in this respect but rather, that Chief and Council had simply assigned as a \"priority\" for attention those five families living in tents.

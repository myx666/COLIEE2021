Regarding the issue of confusion, the Board stated that an applicant must \"establish that there would be no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the marks in issue\", citing", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 32 F.T.R. 152 (T.D.).

As it was bound to do, according to s. 6 of the", "Trade-marks Act", ", R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13 (set out in the attached Annex), the Board considered all of the surrounding circumstances in deciding whether Doris's proposed mark was likely to be confused with Warnaco's mark. It found that Doris's trademark \"Secret\" had been used in relation to hosiery and pantyhose since 1967 and had acquired distinctiveness in relation to those products. However, the Board also found that the reputation of Doris's mark for those products was irrelevant to its application to use the mark on a wider range of wares."], ["[11]", "In addition, the Board found:", "- a resemblance between Doris's \"Secret\" mark and Warnaco's \"Secret Shapers\" mark, primarily in sound;", "- that Warnaco's mark is somewhat less distinctive than Doris's;", "- that the trademark \"Secret Slimmers\" used by Sears Canada Ltd. detracted from the distinctiveness of Doris's mark;", "- that there is an overlap in the nature of the wares in issue, and in the market for them;", "- that Doris had used its \"Secret\" mark in relation to many products, but that it had not proved its parentage of a family of marks; rather, these various uses involved attaching the \"Secret\" mark to a distinct product name, not a true marriage between the \"Secret\" mark and a separate, conjoining element. Further, the Board noted the existence of several other trademarks for similar products that included the word \"Secret\". This evidence, in the Board's view, was incompatible with Doris's claim to a family of \"Secret\" marks."], ["[12]", "Based on these factors, the Board concluded that if Doris used the \"Secret\" mark on the same kinds of wares as were sold by Warnaco, there was a reasonable probability that consumers would be confused about the source of those goods. In the Board's view, Doris had not met its onus of showing that consumers of undergarments would not be confused.", "(b) The new evidence"], ["[13]", "Doris filed three new affidavits on this appeal. The first contained an opinion from Mr. Michael Mulvey, a market research expert, suggesting that consumers would likely perceive undergarments labelled with the \"Secret\" mark as coming from the same source as \"Secret\" hosiery (i.e. Doris), not from Warnaco. Mr. Mulvey also concluded that consumers would likely recognize \"Secret\" products as part of a family of trademarks with the same source. The second affidavit, from Ms. Cheryl Bowden, described her unsuccessful efforts to purchase Warnaco's product, \"Secret Shapers\", in various retail outlets. Two sales clerks had never heard of \"Secret Shapers\". Another mistakenly suggested to Ms. Bowden that \"Secret Shapers\" might be pantyhose. Ms. Bowden did find products manufactured by Warnaco for sale. All of them were labelled with the word \"Olga\" and none bore the name \"Secret Shapers\". The third affidavit, from Ms. Jacqueline Chernys, contained evidence relating to a licensing agreement between Doris and Sears Canada Ltd. Sears had once owned the trademark \"Secret Slimmers\" for an undergarment, but Doris acquired the mark from Sears and then licensed Sears to continue to use it. Sears' catalogues advertised the product along with a reference to Doris's trademark for it."], ["[14]", "Warnaco argues that these new affidavits are irrelevant or inadmissible as hearsay. In my view, Mr. Mulvey's affidavit is admissible as an expert opinion and relevant to the issue of confusion. While Ms. Bowden's affidavit recounts the statements of sales clerks, those statements are not offered for the truth of their contents. Ms. Bowden simply reports what the sales clerks said to her. Her affidavit is also relevant to the issue of confusion."], ["[15]", "As for Ms. Chernys's affidavit, it contains evidence of the licensing arrangement between Doris and Sears, and of the public notice given to that arrangement. It shows the relationship between Doris and Sears at the material time and is relevant to the question whether Sears' use of the \"Secret Slimmers\" mark enured to Doris's benefit."], ["[16]", "This evidence supplemented Doris's arguments that it had established a well-recognized trademark and a family of connected marks. Accordingly, it was relevant to the issue of confusion; that is, whether consumers would likely believe that Doris's products originated with Warnaco, or vice versa. In my view, this evidence would have materially affected the Board's analysis of that issue and, therefore, is admissible on this appeal. In turn, I must decide whether the Board's decision was correct, in light of all of the evidence.", "(c) Was the Board's decision on confusion correct?"], ["[17]", "In my view, the Board erred."], ["[18]", "Doris argued that its many trademarks combining the word \"Secret\" with one or more other words (e.g. \"Secret Colours\") should be recognized as a family of marks. Its application to register \"Secret\" in relation to undergarments should, it submits, be seen simply as a request to recognize an additional family member. Doris relies on the analysis of the concept of a \"family\" of marks in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.)."], ["[19]", "However, I see the issue  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's", "as distinct from the issue here. In", "McDonald's", ", the question was whether a multiplicity of registered trademarks for products with the prefix \"Mc\" or \"Mac\" should allow McDonald's to argue that another company's new variant (i.e. McYogurt) was confusing. Justice Cattanach held that the owner of a series of well-known and related trademarks can rely on its family of marks to show that another company's similar mark within the same range of wares would be confusing."], ["[20]", "Here, the question is whether Doris can point to its existing marks to show that consumers would likely associate it with a new line of products. It is not clear to me that the concept of a family of marks is particularly helpful in this context. The issue is whether Doris's proposed mark is confusing. All of the surrounding circumstances must be considered, including Doris's many \"Secret\" trademarks. However, whether or not those marks could be said to constitute a \"family\" is not the prime concern. In my view, the Board erred by focussing too heavily on the question whether Doris had established a family of trademarks instead of considering the significance of the array of Doris's marks in relation to the issue of confusion."], ["[21]", "The evidence before me suggests that consumers are sufficiently familiar with Doris's trademark \"Secret\", and the wares with which that mark is currently associated, that they would probably believe that closely-related products, such as undergarments, derived from the same source. In other words, consumers would probably not believe that undergarments sold under the trademark \"Secret\" were Warnaco's products."], ["[22]", "Mr. Mulvey's expert opinion is that \"there is a very high likelihood\" that consumers would associate \"Secret\" undergarments with the manufacturer of \"Secret\" hosiery and pantyhose. He considered a number of factors in arriving at that conclusion: the respective market share and position of the parties; the brand awareness of consumers; the manner in which brand information is communicated; the perceived \"fit\" of Doris's proposed brand extension with its existing line; the use of brand identifiers in the marketplace; and the realities of product display. Mr. Mulvey also concluded that consumers would be unlikely to connect \"Secret\" with \"Secret Shapers\" because Warnaco, according to its own evidence, always identified its products with the name \"Olga\". Ms. Bowden confirms this in her affidavit. Overall, I find Mr. Mulvey's evidence persuasive. He was cross-examined on his affidavit but his opinion was unshaken. Indeed, it was reinforced."], ["[23]", "In addition, the evidence before me clarifies Doris's licensing arrangement with Sears Canada Ltd. In my view, the evidence shows that Sears' use of the \"Secret Slimmers\" mark enured to Doris's benefit. It did not detract from or dilute the \"Secret\" mark. Sears referred to the licensing arrangement with Doris in its catalogues. According to the", "Trade-marks Act", ", when public notice of a license has been given and the owner of the license has been identified, the licensee's use of the trademark enures to the benefit of the owner (s. 50(1), (2)). Therefore, on the evidence before me, Sears' use of the \"Secret Slimmers\" trademark enures to Doris's benefit."], ["[24]", "Warnaco protests that the actual licensing agreement was not put in evidence by any representative of either Doris or Sears, and that Doris provided no proof that it controlled Sears' use of the mark. But I see no absolute requirement for actual proof of the agreement. The", "Act", "simply states that where public notice is given that a mark is being used under license, the licensor is presumed to be the beneficiary of that use. Here, Sears \"used\" the mark by including it in its advertisements for the relevant wares. The", "Act", "defines \"use\" to include situations where a trademark is associated with wares in a manner that communicates to the consumer that there is a connection between the mark and the wares (s. 4(1)). In my view, Sears' association of the \"Secret Slimmers\" mark with the corresponding product in its catalogue constitutes \"use\" of Doris's mark. That use, in combination with the reference to the license agreement with Doris, amounted to public notice that the mark was being used under license."], ["[25]", "In addition, in these circumstances, the", "Act", "does not require proof that the licensor exercised control over the licensee's use. Rather, once it has been proved that public notice has been given of the licensed use of the trademark and of the identity of the mark's owner, it is presumed that the owner has control over the character and quality of the wares with which the mark is associated (s. 50(2))."], ["[26]", "In my view, the Board erred in concluding that the licensing arrangement between Doris and Sears did not enure to Doris's benefit."], ["[27]", "Considering the totality of the evidence before me and all the surrounding circumstances, I am satisfied that Doris has discharged its burden of showing that consumers would probably not be confused about the source of undergarments labelled with the \"Secret\" mark.", "4.

The Board found that Doris had failed to show that its \"Secret\" mark, as applied to undergarments, would be distinguishable from other marks, including Warnaco's."], ["[29]", "In my view, the evidence that is relevant to the issue of confusion, and which is referred to earlier, is also relevant to the issue of distinctiveness.

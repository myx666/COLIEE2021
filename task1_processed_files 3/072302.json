It is possible that consumers might respond to AL-RIFAI simpliciter as being a trademark and consider the remaining words to be descriptive matter.

I conclude that this is the case. The key components of the registered mark, the three words AL-RIFAI, ROASTERY and MAHMASAT, have been retained and the French equivalent of 'roastery', namely BRÛLERIE, has been added.

More specifically, the claims for relief comprise a declaration that the officer's decision was erroneous and contrary to the duty of fairness and the rules of natural justice, an order of certiorari to quash the same, and an order for a writ of mandamus directing the respondent to reconsider and process the applicant's request for permanent residence in Canada according to law and to determine whether or not to grant landing accordingly."], ["[2]", "Essentially, the grounds of the application are that the visa officer erred in assessing the applicant at zero units of assessment for the experience factor set out as item 3 in column 1 of Schedule I to the Immigration Regulations, 1978, pursuant to s. 11(1)(b) thereof. Applicant's counsel has no quarrel with the visa officer's assessment in respect of the other selection criteria which, in this case, total 67 points out of a possible 100, thus falling three points short of the passing grade of 70. Moreover, applicant's counsel concedes that he has the onus of proving error in law on the part of the visa officer and, or alternatively, breach of a duty of fairness, failing which the request for the prerogative relief of certiorari and mandamus cannot avail. If I apprehend the matter correctly, the claim for declaratory relief is abandoned in face of the objection by respondent's counsel that declaratory relief cannot be sought by originating motion, but only by an action:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.). In any event, the point was not argued by applicant's counsel. Applicant's counsel further argues that the visa officer seriously erred by failing to consider the applicant's related experience and to break down the job offer requirements and the Canadian Classification Dictionary of Occupations (CCDO) classification into their respective component parts."], ["[3]", "The application for permanent residence by the applicant began with an application of undertaking and assistance by his sister, who was a Canadian citizen and married and living in Calgary, dated November 1, 1988. On March 16, 1989, confirmation of an offer of employment for the applicant of production line manager was approved at the Calgary centre of the Commission. The offer was from Sun Ice Limited, a Calgary-based multinational corporation specializing in the production and sale of ski-wear. The job description contained therein read as follows:", "\"Responsible for productivity of line reporting to shift manager. Correct and assist employees in performing their tasks. Ensure availability of raw materials for the line. Learn to operate computer equipment which controls the line.\"", "The job requirements specified in the confirmation were as follows:", "\"Must be proficient in skills of pattern making, cutting, sewing on production line for clothing manufacturer with at least 10 years experience. Must have experience in supervision and instruction of staff on production line.\"", "This was followed by an application for permanent residence dated on or about April 24, 1989, in which the applicant indicated his intended occupation in Canada as being that of garment factory supervisor. The application set out the applicant's work history, showing that he had operated his own sewing business workshop from 1978 to 1980, that he had been a self-employed subcontractor and agent of sewing work on behalf of a large clothing manufacturer for the period from 1980 to 1986 and that from then until the present he was a sample maker for Single Hearted Garment Co. Ltd."], ["[4]", "Sometime in June of 1988 the applicant was interviewed in Hong Kong by Victor Rempel, vice-president of Sun Ice Limited, who satisfied himself that the applicant had the experience and capability to meet the job requirements of production line manager, subject to his undergoing a period of training to familiarize himself with the computerized nature of the production line so that he could handle the job fully."], ["[5]", "On July 24, 1989, the applicant was interviewed at Hong Kong by the Second Secretary (Immigration) of the Commission, Richard B. Thornton, through an interpreter. There were no notes of this interview, nor does the record contain any computer printout pertaining thereto. What does appear in the record is a copy of a telex dated July 26, 1989 from the Commission office in Hong Kong to the Calgary office, the substantive portion of which reads:", "\"P.I. interviewed 24Jul89 in connection with a/m job offer.

Moreover, in view of PIs lack of english and limited education and funds, case is a failure on points, please notify ER/sponsor.\"", "This was followed by a letter of rejection dated July 26, 1989, which alluded to the selection criteria and the necessity of achieving a sufficient number of credits, and concluded in the following vein:", "\"As you have not accumulated sufficient credits under the above-mentioned selection criteria, you do not meet the requirements for admission to Canada as an independent applicant.\""], ["[6]", "The statutory provisions most relevant to the present case are ss. 8(1)(a), 9(1) and 11(1)(b) of the Immigration Regulations, 1978, as amended."], ["[7]", "Filed in support of the application are two affidavits of the applicant's sister and sponsor, Kelly Chee Chu Wong, the first sworn on January 2, 1990, and the second sworn on June 5, 1990, as well as the affidavit of Victor Rempel, sworn on January 3, 1990. Affidavits filed in opposition were those of Douglas R. Haaland, program specialist of the respondent, sworn on April 17, 1990, identifying the applicant's file, and the affidavit of the visa officer, Richard B.

It is my understanding that Mr. Fong has in excess of ten years of experience in the production and manufacturing of outerwear and other related garments. When I saw him in Hong Kong, he showed me that he was presently working on garments for another skiwear manufacturer selling their product in Alberta and elsewhere in Western Canada. I was extremely interested in his experience that he displayed.", "\"6. That I do verily believe that the Commission for Canada in Hong Kong did not fully explore the related experience that I was interested in when I interviewed Mr. Fong. Having ten years of experience in the skiwear manufacturing business, I assessed Mr. Fong's capabilities and I felt that he was qualified to be trained for the position that he already had vast experience for.\""], ["[9]", "The second affidavit of Kelly Chee Chu Wong, marked as Exhibit 1, merely identifies as an annexed exhibit a letter received under date of May 19, 1990, from the applicant's present employer, Single Hearted Garment Co. Ltd., confirming the nature of the applicant's present employment responsibilities as a sample maker, extolling his capabilities, and showing in particular that he was \"in charge of forty workers in one production line\". Counsel for the respondent raises the objection that the information contained therein is irrelevant for purposes of this proceeding in which the issue is simply to determine whether the visa officer erred on the basis of the information that was before him. The same thing could probably be said of the other affidavits, but they are at least illustrative of what is actually at stake and I propose to consider them in that context."], ["[10]", "Also forming part of the record is the applicant's employment summary, which is in the same category as the affidavits sworn after the fact. This summary shows an impressive 20 years' experience in the garment industry from the commencement of his apprenticeship in 1968, following graduation from high school in Hong Kong. For the years 1978 to 1980, the applicant indicates that he operated his own sewing business with 16 operators and that he designed his own clothing layouts and patterns."], ["[11]", "It must be remembered that the affidavit of the visa officer, Mr. Thornton, was made and sworn some nine months or more after the interview conducted on July 24, 1989. Respondent's counsel asserts that the affidavit was based on a computer printout of the affiant's interview notes, but there is no evidence of that nor does the affidavit so state. Consequently, the affidavit must be viewed with some circumspection, apart from its self-serving tenor. With that qualification, the most relevant portions of the Thornton affidavit are paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7, which read:", "\"4. To determine whether Mr. Fong could meet the requirements of the position, I questioned him on his past and present employment duties. He confirmed the information given on his written application for permanent residence in Canada (IMM8) that he had worked from 1978-1986 as a self-employed sewer, and from 1986 to the date of the interview as a sample maker with the Single Hearted Garment Co. Ltd. He also produced a letter of reference signed by a director of that company attesting to his employment as a sample maker. Mr. Fong made no mention in his answers to my questions of having worked for at least 10 years on a production line for a clothing manufacturer, or of having any experience in the supervision and instruction of staff on a production line.", "\"5. As is my standard practice in all situations where refusal of an application appears likely or possible, I asked Mr. Fong at the conclusion of my questioning whether there was any other information relevant to his case that we had not covered and which he would wish to add for my consideration. To the best of my recollection, Mr. Fong mentioned at that time the presence of several family members in Canada and expressed a wish to join them. Again, to the best of my recollection, Mr. Fong did not avail himself of this opportunity to inform me as to any other information relevant to his employment background, training or skills not previously covered in my questioning or elsewhere in his application.", "\"6. In reaching a decision to refuse Mr. Fong's case, I took into account that he had not proved that he had 10 years of experience on a production line with a clothing manufacturer (having only shown three years of any kind of employment with a clothing manufacturer) or that he had any experience in the supervision and instruction of staff on a production line. Knowledge of the local garment industry gained through previous interviewing experience and consultation with local experts indicates that the functions of a sample maker and those of a production line manager are separate and distinct -- indeed, they appear at virtually opposite ends of the garment making process. Sample makers are not normally involved with production line activities -- and vice versa. Further, the salary being paid to Mr. Fong of $4,000 HK per month (approximately $620 CDN) is not commensurate with local pay scales in the garment business for supervisory or managerial positions. Finally, none of the responsibilities outlined by Mr. Fong matched with those appearing in the CCDO description of production line manager to be found in Volume 1 of the CCDO manual at paragraph 1143-114; nor does he meet the training and entry requirements for such, which are outlined in Volume 2 of the CCDO as including 'secondary school graduation' (Mr. Fong has completed eight years of schooling) and 'ten years of experience, supplemented by part-time or full-time courses in the speciality ...\" (Mr. Fong has neither).", "\"7. After consideration of the foregoing, I concluded that Mr. Fong had shown neither the direct nor related employment experience to indicate that he could meet the requirements of the job offer as set out on the EMP 2151. He was therefore awarded 0 units under Factor 3 of Schedule I to the Immigration Regulations -- and refused pursuant to the provisions of R11(1) of the Immigration Regulations which state that a visa officer may base a refusal upon an award of 0 units for the experience factor (item 3 of column 1 to Schedule I of the Regulations). The total number of units an applicant may be awarded pursuant to other factors set forth in Schedule I in no way fetters an officer's ability to base a refusal on the failure to compile [sic] with R11(1).\""], ["[12]", "Applicant's counsel makes the point that there is no evidence of Mr. Thornton's interview notes, contrary to the usual practice. He lays particular stress on the fact that there is no indication whether the visa officer considered the applicant's related experience in order to determine whether it matched the experience required under the job officer and the accompanying CCDO classification. Counsel refers to an article entitled Conundrum: Immigration Selection -- Occupational and Experience Factors, by C.L. Rotenberg, Q.C., appearing at 6 Imm. L.R.(2d) at page 24 et seq, which refers to the Policy Memorandum of Employment and Immigration Canada in reference to the assessment of experience and occupational demand factors in column 1 of Schedule I to the Immigration Regulations and particularly the characterization of Type III appearing in the Policy Memorandum, which reads:", "\"Type III The applicant has not performed the full spectrum of duties, but has nonetheless carried out some portion of the duties in the 'eligible' occupation. This argument implies that occupations may be broken down into major characteristics, e.g., some pharmacists may qualify as pharmaceutical representatives.\""], ["[13]", "Applicant's counsel makes the point that the Type III analysis is a direction from the Minister to visa officers that they must look beyond titles in determining whether an applicant has the overall experience related to the position for which he claims to be qualified. According to him, the only thing we are left with in the present case is Mr. Thornton's conclusion that a sample maker is not a production line manager, and therefore lacks the requisite experience. Taking everything into account, applicant's counsel submits that the interviewing officer erred in law by refusing or neglecting to break down the constituent elements of each of the jobs indicated by the applicant in his work history and taking the same into consideration when analyzing the production line job with a view to determining whether the applicant fitted the requirements. In his submission, the failure to do so resulted in a \"0\" assessment, and constituted error in law."], ["[14]", "Alternatively, applicant's counsel submits that the visa officer's failure to take into consideration the different job functions which the applicant performed during his entire working life in the garment industry for the purpose of assessing his job related experience amounted to a breach of the duty of fairness. He makes the further submission that there was a duty incumbent on the visa officer, once the matter of job experience had become critical to the success or failure of the application, to point the path of direction by appropriate questions, especially by reason of the applicant's language difficulty. As he put it, simply to ask if the applicant had anything further to add is another glaring breach of the duty of fairness."], ["[15]", "Counsel for the respondent starts with the proposition that the onus rests squarely on the applicant to satisfy the visa officer that he met the selection standards established by the Regulations for purposes of determining his admissibility, by virtue of s. 6 of the Immigration Act, 1976. Counsel contends that there is nothing to indicate that the visa officer, Mr. Thornton, failed to consider all the evidence before him in relation to the applicant's intended occupation. In her submission, what applicant's counsel is simply asking is that I substitute my opinion of the appropriate experience assessment for that of the visa officer's, contrary to the principles of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Fed. T.D.) and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Fed. T.D.). As to the absence of interview notes, counsel's explanation is that these were contained in a computer printout which was not generated as part of the relevant file material. Finally, respondent's counsel stresses again that there is no evidence of any failure on the part of the visa officer to make a proper assessment of the experience factor, nor is there anything indicative of a breach of the duty of fairness."], ["[16]", "The whole issue, as it seems to me, comes down to this: whether the visa officer erred in law in the manner in which he conducted his interview by failing to delve sufficiently into the applicant's related experience in making a \"0\" assessment in respect thereof or, failing that, whether there was some breach of a duty of fairness."], ["[17]", "In both the Fung and Wang cases, supra, the applicants failed to convince the visa officers that they had the necessary experience in the intended occupation, after a thorough-going investigation and evaluation of all pertinent factors. Indeed, in both of these cases the visa officers fairly apprised the applicants of the specific deficiencies in respect of the intended occupations, and afforded them ample opportunity to respond thereto."], ["[18]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), the applicant was successful in obtaining certiorari quashing refusal of his request for permanent residence and mandamus directing that the application be reconsidered according to law on the grounds of the visa officer's error in law in failing to assess alternate work experience in relation to the intended occupation and breach of a duty of fairness to afford an opportunity to provide information in support of current experience in each included occupation. Jerome, A.C.J., stated the following rationale for the decision at pp. 86-87 F.C.:", "\"... As the [visa] officer stated in the letter received by the applicant:", "'I do not believe that your various responsibilities can be broken down into separate components for the purposes of awarding you units of assessment for experience in your alternative intended occupation ...'", "\"Such an interpretation is a clear error of law. The Regulations permit the applicant to be assessed in 'an occupation'. The factors listed in column I of Schedule I require that the experience of the applicant be assessed with regard to his intended occupation. There is no reason why the actual experience and time spent in each of the various responsibilities in an occupation cannot be broken down to award units of assessment for experience in intended occupations. ...", "\"I should also add that as a matter of fairness the record should show that the applicant was given the opportunity to provide information in support of his current experience in each included occupation. The record must equally indicate reasons which support the visa officer's assignment of a specific experience rating to the included occupations or reasons which support the refusal to do so.\""], ["[19]", "In my view, there is no cogent evidence in the present case that the visa officer went beyond the intended job description of production line manager and the CCDO definition thereof and directed a specific line of questioning as to the applicant's actual work experience in the garment industry broken down into its constituent elements for the purpose of making an appropriate assessment with respect to their adaptability or transferability to the intended occupation. It is apparent from Mr. Thornton's affidavit that he made no attempt to do this. In my opinion, his failure to do so constituted an error in law. I am also of the opinion that the visa officer committed a breach of the duty of fairness by his failure to afford the applicant an adequate opportunity to answer the specific case against him on the issue of related experience vis-à-vis the job offer of production line manager, which could have been done and should have been done by an appropriate line of questioning, once it became apparent that the application for permanent residence was likely to fail on that score. This was the course followed by the visa officers in the Fung and Wang cases."], ["[20]", "In the present case, Mr. Thornton chose to follow a different path. According to his standard practice in that situation, as deposed in paragraph 5 of his affidavit, he asked the applicant if there was any other information relevant to the case that had not been covered and which he might wish to add for the officer's consideration. According to the affiant's recollection, the matters mentioned by the applicant were not at all responsive to the critical issue. It is small wonder, in view of the language difficulty, despite the presence of the interpreter, and the general, rambling nature of the question, if it could even be called that."], ["[21]", "In the case of In re H.K. (An Infant), [1967] 2 Q.B. 617, Lord Parker C.J. said at p. 630:", "\"... I doubt whether it can be said that the immigration authorities are acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity as those terms are generally understood. But at the same time, I myself think that even if an immigration officer is not in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity, he must at any rate give the immigrant an opportunity of satisfying him of the matters in the subsection, and for that purpose let the immigrant know what his immediate impression is so that the immigrant can disabuse him. That is not, as I see it, a question of acting or being required to act judicially, but of being required to act fairly.\"", "Incidentally, this case was but one of the many authorities referred to by Dickson, J. (later Chief Justice of Canada), in his classic judgment in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , regarding the availability of certiorari as a general remedy for failure by administrative decision-makers to exercise the duty of fairness."], ["[22]", "Applying the principle of In re H.K. (An Infant), supra, to the facts of the present case, I find that there was a further breach of the duty of fairness in the failure of the visa officer to apprise the applicant by appropriate questions of his immediate impression regarding the deficiency of proof of intended and related employment and the likely consequences thereof in order to afford the applicant some opportunity of disabusing the former's mind of the crucial impression."], ["[23]", "For these reasons, the applicant's motion must succeed. Accordingly, an order will go for certiorari to quash the visa officer's decision of July 26, 1989, and for mandamus requiring the respondent to consider the application for permanent residence according to the relevant provisions of the Immigration Act, 1976, and the Immigration Regulations, 1978. The applicant is entitled to his costs of the motion.", "Application allowed.", "Editor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/ldl", "[End of document]"]]}

That order, granted on an ex parte application by the Crown, authorized the Minister of National Revenue to take any of the actions described in s. 225.1(a) to (g) of the Income Tax Act, including authorizing a designated sheriff to hold under seizure a 1984 Lake Renegade airplane belonging to the applicant Satellite.

On March 20, 1989, Rouleau, J., adjourned, sine die, the Crown's March 13 motion to dismiss the respondent's December 22, 1988, motion and, at the same time, dismissed an application by David Brough, the owner and principal officer of the applicant corporation, who is not a lawyer, to represent the applicant in these proceedings. On April 12 by motion returnable on April 24, 1989, the Crown applied once again to bring on and to dismiss the adjourned December 22, 1988, motion of the applicant. On April 24 the matter was further adjourned to April 26, but was not then dealt with again until April 27 at which time it was set over to May 29, 1989, but again, on that date it was adjourned sine die, returnable on the usual two days notice.

That section of the Act provides that a certificate when filed shall be deemed to be a judgment of the court against the debtor for a debt due to Her Majesty. Under the writ an aircraft, alleged by the Crown to be the property of the applicant corporation, Satellite, was seized by the Sheriff. In other proceedings David Brough has sought to contest the validity of the seizure and of the writ of fieri facias, inter alia, on the ground that the aircraft is not owned by the applicant corporation Satellite.

It is claimed that notice of reassessment was not received prior to seizure of the aircraft now held by the sheriff. The matter was heard by the Tax court November 28, 1988, and thereafter it allowed the application for late filing. On that same day as the Tax Court heard the application the Crown applied ex parte to this court and was issued the so-called \"jeopardy order\" under s. 225.2(2) of the Income Tax Act as amended, the order which the applicant's motion of December 22, 1988 seeks to have reviewed and set aside."], ["[6]", "While there are numerous initiatives in the name of the corporate party, Satellite Earth Station Technology Inc. and of its principal officer, Brough, the only matter fully dealt with in the hearing on June 26, as specified in the Notice of Return of Motion dated June 22, and the only issue dealt with in these reasons is whether the applicant corporation, Satellite, is entitled under s. 225.2 (8) of the Income Tax Act as amended, to have set aside the earlier order of this court made November 28, 1988.

Satellite was a small, fledgling enterprise dependant significantly upon Brough and to a lesser extent Manchee, and at least in 1986 it was not operated on a very business-like basis in terms of records and the meeting of formal requirements. In these respects it may not be unique among small struggling enterprises. The first general conclusion is that, despite the less than tidy operations of the company, a number of the concerns raised by the taxation officers as the basis for the conclusion by Lee, the officer responsible, that delay would jeopardize collection are answered in a reasonable way by evidence offered in relation to the company's application for review. That conclusion led in May 1988 to action by the Minister in accord with s. 223 of the Income Tax Act, to the filing of the certificate and then to the issue of the writ of fieri facias. It was also the basis of the application on behalf of the Crown, made ex parte on November 28, 1988, for authorization by order of this court in accord with s. 225.2, as amended with effect from September 1988."], ["[27]", "The second general conclusion from the applicant's evidence, that is, that a number of the concerns of the Department's officers can be reasonably answered, leads to a reasonable doubt about the likelihood of jeopardy, as a result of delay, in the collection process. This requires an assessment of whether all the evidence available at the date of hearing, June 26, 1989, on balance of probability leads to a conclusion that it is more likely than not that collection of part or all of the debt due Her Majesty would be jeopardized by delay. That is the standard required by s. 225.2(2) to support an order from the court authorizing collection action by the Minister, and that is the standard to be met upon review if the authorization once granted is to be sustained."], ["[28]", "The applicant, Satellite, is a corporation organized under the laws of Ontario in 1981. Apparently it was principally engaged in the manufacture, sale and servicing of Satellite dishes or instruments for reception of television or electronic signals, but its objects were not limited to these activities. By 1986 the corporation had encountered financial difficulties. Its place of business had been moved a number of times, the scale of its activities had been reduced, the relationship between the two principal players in the company was undergoing change, and some consideration was being given to alternative activities within the company's objects."], ["[29]", "Any shares of the corporation were held by David Brough and Joni Manchee, though they appear not to have in vested, or at least not to have kept track of any investment, finacially in the company. They managed its operations on the basis of sales and by withdrawing little in wages or dividends. Initially both were officers of the company; for a time following a personal bankruptcy in 1985 Brough resigned as an officer. After resolution of relations between the two of them and of Manchee's withdrawal from the company, from late 1986 or early 1987 Brough was the sole officer and president of the company. By agreement between the two principals in October 1986 Brough was considered to have purchased the assets of the company, though apparently no corporate documents were executed as evidence of the intended transaction. By further agreements in 1987 certain continuing responsibilities were outlined between the corporation and Manchee, and between the corporation and Brough. By an agreement made in January 1988, Brough agreed to purchase the shares in the company which they deemed were held by Manchee who until then had been perceived as the major shareholder in the company. In March 1988, a vehicle originally registered in the name of the company and apparently purchased by it was transferred to Manchee. All of the agreements referred to were between Brough and Manchee, without execution of any documents on behalf of the corporation."], ["[30]", "In the summer of 1986 the Department of National Revenue, Taxation, initiated an audit of the company's operations and its tax liability. This led to correspondence, initiated by the department in November 1986, concerning operating expenses and research expenditures claimed on behalf of the company in the years 1984 and 1985. Brough replied to these letters on behalf of the corporation in December 1986, and the accountant retained by the company in previous years wrote to the department in February 1987. These replies were apparently not satisfactory explanations for the department which wrote again to the company for the attention of Brough in mid-April 1987. Brough replied two weeks later disputing some of the positions of the department auditor, indicating he would be writing to the Minister to complain of the department's methods and offering to meet department representatives to resolve concerns about research expenditures. Apparently there were discussions between tax auditors and the company's accountant early in 1987."], ["[31]", "In the spring of 1987 the company left premises in Milton, Ontario, where it had previously based its satellite dish operations, and withdrew to an address in Hillsburgh, Ontario, where Manchee and Brough had lived and where they considered some of their business activities had been based. Later, there were to be different perceptions between the department's officers and Brough about the circumstances of the company's occupations of these properties. While normal advice for change of address to postal authorities for purposes of forwarding mail for four months, and to creditors and debtors of the company, is claimed to have been provided no special advice was provided to the department and there was, after the spring of 1987 obvious uncertainty on the part of the department about the business address of the company."], ["[32]", "Brough who had apparently written to the Minister in the spring of 1987 from the Milton address of the company did not receive a reply although one was apparently sent in August. The Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise branch, wrote to the company at the Hillsburgh address in July 1987, so that at least another branch of the same department was cognizant of the company's address then. The company address had been provided to the telephone company. Taxation officers had telephoned Brough about company tax matters, at least once in April 1988, at the Hillsburgh address. There is evidence the department's taxation officers were not completely ignorant of the Hillsburgh address since part of the company's expenses in dispute for 1986 related to operations at that address."], ["[33]", "Whether or not uncertainty about the company's address was warranted, the department did issue, in December 1987, addressed to the former address of the company, in Milton, notice of reassessment of tax liability of the company for the years of 1984, 1985 and 1986, claiming at that time a total in tax and interest arrears of more than $104,000. This notice and two subsequent collection letters in January and February, 1988 demanding payment, all apparently addressed to the company's former Milton address, were not received by the company or by Brough, though the letters were not returned to the department through the postal service."], ["[34]", "In April 1988 one of the department's officers telephoned the company at its Hillsburgh address. There is conflicting evidence about the conversation but agreement that on that occasion Brough did say that the company had done virtually no business for a year or more, and that its assets had been dispersed, without reference to where the assets had gone, i.e., largely to him. There is dispute as to whether anything was then said about taxes owed or about payment of taxes by the company. On May 10, as noted earlier, the department initiated legal action filing a certificate under s. 223, indicating taxes and arrears of interest in excess of $108,000 then owed, and obtaining a writ of fieri facias."], ["[35]", "What factors are said to indicate risk that delay in collection processes would jeopardize ultimate collection of the whole or part of the debt claimed? As outlined in the affidavit of Sherman Lee and as amplified by submissions of counsel at the review hearing these can be summarized, with the explanations offered on behalf of the applicant Satellite, under four main headings."], ["[36]", "First, concern was expressed about the instability of the business location of the company. It had operated from several locations since its incorporations in 1981, and officers of the department believed on information provided by third parties that the company had been locked out of its leased premises in Milton with rental payments in arrears, and that the landlord of the Hillsburgh property had commenced action to evict Brough and thus the company, because of lease infractions. The evidence of Brough and Manchee is that while the company may have been locked out by the landlord of the Milton property, that was done at the end of the term of the lease which the landlord had earlier tried to have renewed. The evidence of Brough and Callighen was that any difficulties with the landlord of the Hillsburgh property arose over differences about landlord and tenant's obligations but in any event these had been resolved. Whatever the company's difficulties with its several landlords were, and implicitly whatever may have been the cause of departmental uncertainty about the company's address, these factors do not in themselves lead to any basis for concluding that delay would jeopardize collection."], ["[37]", "Second, reluctance on the part of Brough to file tax returns for 1987 and to provide documentation was set out by Sherman Lee as a basis for concluding there was risk warranting special action. The company's tax return for 1987 was due not later than November of that year. When it was not filed Brough had been requested by letters twice in June of 1988 to file the return, he was personally served in August with a notice to do so and in October was urged again to do so since the department was in a position to prosecute him for continuing failure. At the time of his affidavit of November 25, 1988, Lee indicates that the return for 1987 was still outstanding, Brough's affidavit swears that it was filed before November 25, 1988. On the other aspect of reluctance to provide information requested, Lee's affidavit points to the requests in November 1986 and April 1987 for information about expenditures for research and development. Yet it was the failure to provide such information that led in part to the reassessment of tax liability of the company, so that it is not as if the requests for information created any special barrier to departmental actions. In my view, the reluctance referred to in relation to information about research expenditures and in relation to the 1987 return, have no significance in considering the risk from delay in collection of arrears of taxes and interest claimed for the years 1984 to 1986."], ["[38]", "The third general factor relied on by officers of the department was the change in assets of the corporation. In financial statements filed with the company's 1986 tax return, assets of the company included an Ultimate 100 aircraft, a Lake Renegade aircraft and a 1986 Nissan van all purchased from company funds. Yet subsequently the ultimate aircraft was registered in the name of Brough, the Lake Renegade aircraft was said to have been purchased by Brough and registered in the United States in the name of Brough's mother who is resident in the United States, and the Nissan van was transferred to Manchee's name in March 1988, apparently as part of the settlement arrangements of personal relations and corporate involvement of Manchee. In addition the department pointed to a company bank account closed out, with the balance in the account apparently distributed in the spring of 1987, largely between Manchee and Brough. The evidence of the two principals is that the account in question was closed when the company ceased operations in Milton and another account, nearer Hillsburgh, was opened. In November 1988 the officers of the department apparently believed that the only asset of value of the company was the Lake Renegade aircraft which had originally been ordered seized under the writ of fieri facias in May. As noted earlier, another action contests the validity of the department's action, in part on the ground that at the time that aircraft was not owned by the company."], ["[39]", "The fourth general factor, implicitly underlying the department's action and developed in submissions of counsel at the hearing of this matter, was the instability of the company's operations from 1986 and particularly in 1988. By the latter year the company's operations had virtually ceased, and its cash receipts in the previous year were only about $15,000 as estimated by Brough. He professes that consideration was being given to other activities to be undertaken within the company's objects, in particular the production of documentary films for which use of the aircraft now held by the sheriff was crucial, and he points as well to grants available to the company to promote sales abroad, grants apparently available only to meet travel expenses if a representative of the company could travel within the terms of these grants. Despite continuing difficulties for the company, the department was able by the affidavit of Jang, to point to those difficulties being ignored or even misrepresented by Brough in applications for these grants. Efforts by Brough were unsuccessful in obtaining a letter of guarantee from a bank to meet the claims of the department if those were upheld following his appeal on behalf of the company because the company had been virtually out of business for two years."], ["[40]", "Finally, as part of the instability in the company's operations by 1988, the department appears to have been concerned about changes in responsibilities for the operations of the company, with the departure of Manchee, with whom tax officers had originally dealt, and the assumption of full responsibilities by Brough. Department officers only learned of these changes commencing in April of 1988. At the same time they learned that Brough had acquired in 1986 a so-called \"green card\" to permit him to work in the United States, and that he claimed some involvement in corporate activities in that country. In response, Brough's evidence is that the \"green card\" issued in 1986 merely replaced a card he had earlier held and had lost and that he had for some years done some work, claiming work for the applicant company, in the United States. In my view, whatever may have been the change in responsibilities for the company's operations, these were still principally influenced by Brough as they had been since the company's inception and there was no evidence that Brough intended to leave Canada to avoid company liabilities or to evade collection of taxes if his appeal is unsuccessful about the tax claims of the department."], ["[41]", "When one considers all these factors it seems to me that only two in combination could possibly warrant the conclusion that collection of the debt claimed by Her Majesty would be jeopardized by delay in collection processes. Those are that the one asset deemed by the department to be owned by the company which was of sufficient value to meet the debt, the Lake Renegade aircraft, might, in the circumstances of continuing instability of the company's operations, be wasted or transferred. It is an irony that Brough contends that the aircraft is deteriorating because of improper maintenance since it has been held by the sheriff's office. The instability of the company was not a new development in 1988, and in itself it would not warrant a conclusion of risk if collection be delayed. Nor would the fact that the company's assets are changed or reduced, in itself warrant such a conclusion unless there is a reasonable basis on the evidence to conclude that transfer of assets, which are not naturally wasting, has been or will be effected to avoid the claims of creditors including Her Majesty, or that the assets are likely to be moved out of the jurisdiction and beyond the reach of the department."], ["[42]", "In this case considerable mistrust appears to have developed between department officers and Brough. Brough may well have appeared less than open and truthful in his dealings with representatives of the department and he may well have perceived the officers as less than fair and cooperative. From the perspective of each their mistrust may appear warranted, but it is unfortunate. It appears to have generated suspicion on the part of the taxation officers that Brough was simply seeking to evade payment of taxes deemed due from the company. That suspicion might have been inferred from the facts that those responsible for the company were aware of the audit and subsequent correspondence about liability of the company for past taxes and that assets of the company, which was already in some financial difficulty, were distributed between the principals in less than orthodox fashion. But there is not evidence, in my view, that would warrant this suspicion as a reasonable conclusion and suspicion in itself is not a reasonable basis for authorization to avoid delay in collection which s. 225.1 of the Act specifies as the normal case."], ["[43]", "It is my assessment that the evidence in this case does not lead to a conclusion on the balance of probability, that it is more likely than not that collection of all or part of the debt due Her Majesty would be jeopardized by delay in the collection process."], ["[44]", "In the circumstances the application of the corporation Satellite is allowed and the order made November 28, 1988, is set aside pursuant to s. 225.2(8) of the Income Tax Act. At the same time, the complementary motion of the Crown that the application of the corporation be dismissed is itself dismissed."], ["[45]", "Costs are awarded to the applicant Satellite.", "Order accordingly.", "Editor: Reginald W.

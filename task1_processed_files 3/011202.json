The issue ultimately made its way to this Court by way of judicial review. Justice Anne Mactavish concluded that Mr Spidel had been treated unfairly and that the warden's decision had been unreasonable (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[2]", "Mr Spidel subsequently submitted another grievance in which he identified several errors in the Commissioner's Directive relating to Inmate Committees [CD 083]. His main concern is that CD 083 does not accord with Justice Mactavish's decision. He filed this latest grievance at the final, third-level of the Offender Grievance Procedure based on his view that issues relating to the content of Commissioner's Directives should be brought directly to the Commissioner himself. A delegate of the Commissioner, a Senior Deputy Commissioner [SDC], concluded that Mr Spidel's grievance essentially raised matters of general policy that fell outside the ambit of the grievance process. The SDC therefore rejected Mr Spidel's grievance and suggested that he bring the matter before an inmate committee, where members can make recommendations relating to matters affecting the inmate population as a whole."], ["[3]", "Mr Spidel argues that the SDC erred in concluding that his complaint fell outside the grievance procedure and that it should have been brought to an inmate committee. He asks me to quash the SDC's decision and refer the matter back for reconsideration."], ["[4]", "I can find no basis for overturning the SDC's decision and must, therefore, dismiss this application for judicial review."], ["[5]", "The issue is whether the SDC erred in law.", "II.", "The Legal Framework", "(1) The Grievance Process"], ["[6]", "Offenders are entitled to a fair and expeditious process for resolving grievances that fall within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Corrections (", "Corrections and Conditional Release Act", ", SC 1992, c 20, s 90 [CCRA]; provisions cited are set out in an Annex)."], ["[7]", "The Offender Grievance Procedure is set out in the", "Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations", ", SOR/92-620 [CCRR].

In any case, the decision of the Commissioner represents the final stage of the grievance process (s 15).

It is not clear who the Commissioner's supervisor would be. The next steps would involve an institutional head and a regional head. It seems unlikely that a decision of the Commissioner's supervisor, whoever that might be, would be reviewed by officials subordinate to the Commissioner himself. Further, the final step would involve review by the Commissioner, bringing the matter full circle back to the person about whose conduct the offender is complaining in the first place. It is unlikely that this process accommodates complaints about the Commissioner, given that it creates a closed loop with the Commissioner himself having the final word about the disposition of the complaint."], ["[19]", "Accordingly, I cannot conclude that the SDC erred in finding that Mr Spidel's grievance did not fall within the Offender Grievance Procedure.

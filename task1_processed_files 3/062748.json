To make things even more difficult, Ms. Causey's sister was murdered in 1992.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "At 56 years old, Ms. Causey does not plan to return to work or seek work in the near future.

Due to the complete lack of medical evidence about her disability pursuant to the", "CPP", "by \"the latest possible date of onset of illness\" - that is, December 1994, she could not prove she was disabled in any manner at that time. Indeed, the Tribunal found Ms. Causey's evidence confirmed she was able to work until she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease on April 1, 2003. Furthermore, the help she provided her parents from 1989 to 2005 by looking after them, cleaning, doing laundry and grocery shopping indicated she was able to do some work.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "DECISION UNDER REVIEW  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "On February 15, 2006, a designated member of the Pension Appeals Board granted Ms. Causey leave to appeal the Review Tribunal's decision.

While the 90-day appeal period expired approximately December 1, 2005, the Board accepted that Ms. Causey's letter dated December 2, 2005 was received within the time limit.

I note that the phrases in paragraph 18.1(4)(d) are disjunctive; one asks whether the decision under review was based on a finding of fact that was made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before the decision-maker.

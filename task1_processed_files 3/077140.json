Because this declaration was inconsistent with information recorded in Mr. Ghaedi's passport, Mr. Ghaedi was ordered to complete a residency questionnaire and to attend for a citizenship interview.

He observed that in the absence of a right of appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal, there was no judicial mechanism by which the jurisprudential disagreement as to the proper test could be readily resolved. He expressed the hope, however, that the impasse would be solved by then pending legislative amendments. He concluded that, notwithstanding that the issue of residency was one \"close to the correctness end of the spectrum\", deference was required when the decision under review clearly demonstrated the proper application of the facts to any of the three previously recognized tests for residency. It is also apparent from his reasons that he was influenced in part by the expectation that legislative changes would be forthcoming [see footnote 1]."], ["[10]", "Unfortunately the legislative amendments anticipated in", "Lam,", "above, never came to fruition. In the result, the decision has become well entrenched in this Court's jurisprudence and the Citizenship Court has quite properly followed it.

He concluded his analysis with the following admonition:", "21 Accordingly, I find that the qualitative test set out in", "Papadogiorgakis", "and elaborated upon in", "Koo", "should be applied where an applicant has not met the physical test.

He was told that the officers were still in his home and were looking for him as a supporter of Abdul Aziz. Some time around mid-day, the Applicant received a phone call from his sister informing him that the security forces were still in his home and cautioning him not to return.

The Applicant testified at the hearing that he was issued a citizenship card in 1989 but that his uncle was too afraid to send it to him. The Board's conclusion was that the Applicant never had the citizenship card. The Board found that the Applicant's oral evidence was inconsistent with the objective evidence for the following reasons:", "• The Applicant's description of the document was incomplete;", "• The Applicant denied that the citizenship card was necessary to write exams; and", "• While the Applicant testified that he has the old citizenship card, the objective evidence does not indicate that there is a new citizenship card, and the only card described in the objective evidence is different in color from the \"new card\" described by the Applicant."], ["[10]", "The Board also noted that the Applicant presented contradictory statements. He first said that he had obtained the citizenship card in 1989. He then stated that he had to present the citizenship card in order to receive his secondary school diploma in 1988.

The Board noted that the Applicant stated in his PIF that he finished school in 1988."], ["[11]", "The Board also took issue with the Applicant's failure to mention the citizenship card in his PIF at Question 22 (\"What other identify documents do you have or could you obtain?\") and rejected his explanation for failing to obtain the document from his uncle. In the Board's view, if the Applicant's uncle was able to provide him with a fraudulent Dutch passport, it does not make sense that he would be too afraid to mail legitimate documents."], ["[12]", "Finally, the Board found that the Applicant's oral evidence concerning the \"personal card\" was inadequate. The Applicant's description of the card and minimum age requirement was found to be inconsistent with the objective evidence.

The Board also found that the Applicant had presented inconsistent statements regarding the time when he first found out that the security forces were looking for him.

As submitted by the Applicant, official stamps are recognized as security features in the jurisprudence of this Court, and the following quote from", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [", "Ru", "] is but one illustration of that jurisprudence:", "My review of the Marriage Certificate reveals that the English translation says that the original does bear an official seal or stamp.

Such credibility problems are completely unrelated to the birth registration document, and it is clearly incorrect to assess the validity of a document on the basis of concerns that are completely unrelated to the document itself: see, for ex.,", "Ru", ", above, at para 53.

In the case at bar, the Board made a number of credibility findings, some being entirely reasonable but others clearly not so."], ["[26]", "In the first category the discrepancies between the Applicant's PIF narrative and his testimony are noted by the Board. The Applicant informed the Board for the first time during the hearing that Sudanese security forces had instructed him to present himself to them in Khartoum by the evening of June 29, 2011 and that they had approached his uncle asking about his whereabouts. The Applicant tried to explain that his PIF was only meant to be a summary of his story, but the Board reasonably questioned that explanation, stressing that the very core of his claim was the pursuit of Sudanese security forces and that these were not insignificant details. The Board also found that the Applicant had provided inconsistent evidence as to when he became aware security forces came looking for him, stating in his PIF narrative that his uncle telephoned him around 10:30 in the morning, whereas he responded at the hearing that he came to know about it when his sister telephoned him around 12:30."], ["[27]", "Other findings, however, are much more debatable. For example, the Board found that the Applicant never had a citizenship card because he was only able to point to 6 of the 9 particulars contained in this document. Despite the fact that Mr. Elhassan correctly identified that the citizenship card has a green exterior with white interior and contains his photograph, a stamp, the Minister's signature, and his mother's name, the panel drew a negative inference with respect to Mr. Elhassan's credibility because he forgot to refer to his fingerprint, details of his tribe and his father's name. It was unreasonable to expect an individual to recall every single detail on a piece of identification. Even the most familiar piece of identification contains information that is difficult to completely recall."], ["[28]", "The Applicant also testified that he did not have to provide any documents to sit for his tests or exams in school. Yet, in order to discount his testimony, the Board relied on objective evidence dating from 2007 according to which a person will not be able to sit for exams at schools or university without a certificate of nationality. In doing so, the Board shifted the burden of proof and required the Applicant to provide corroborating documentation to show that this system only started subsequent to the Applicant finishing his studies. Having said that, the Board could rightly point out that the Applicant shifted his testimony and provided inconsistent evidence when asked what documents he presented to obtain his secondary school certificate."], ["[29]", "I need not go through a minute examination of all the credibility findings made by the Board. As already mentioned, some adverse credibility findings are eminently reasonable, while others are microscopic and unfair. Had it not been for the errors committed in assessing the Applicant's identity, I might have been inclined to quash the application for judicial review and to find in favour of the Minister. However, as stated by the Board, identity was the determinative issue in this case, and the flaws undermining and contaminating that analysis unavoidably coloured the credibility assessment. Had the Board properly applied the relevant principles in resolving the identity issue, it may well have found in favour of the Applicant with respect to his credibility."], ["[30]", "For those reasons, this application for judicial review is granted.

On one occasion he was called a \"fag\" and had hot coffee thrown on him, on another he was beaten and had his nose broken, and, on another he required hospital treatment to extract broken glass from his foot because he had been forced to use his foot to break a glass door to escape from a mob."], ["[5]", "When he was 18 years old he applied for a national identification card but was denied because he refused to declare that he was Muslim.

He joined the 519 Community Centre and the YMCA, he met men in the YMCA steam room for casual relationships. He subsequently developed haemorrhoids and began to worry about AIDS. By the time of his PRRA and H&C applications, he had been celibate for three years. He suffers from depression, PTSD, OCD and Tourette's Syndrome. His mental illnesses, although treated with medication, tend to isolate him from others and have prevented him from working.

The Officer found that the Applicant should not have had a reasonable expectation that he would be able to remain in Canada permanently given his immigration history.

The Officer noted the March 8, 2000 decision of the Board finding that the Applicant's assertion that he was a Jew was not credible and denying his application for refugee status, as well as the PRRA Decision which the Officer had rendered the day before. While not bound by the PRRA tests or the Board's decision, the Officer found that the Applicant had failed to provide sufficient evidence which rebutted the Board's credibility findings and determination that his claim to be Jewish was not credible. His alleged personal risks due to being Jewish were not corroborated nor did the evidence support his claim that he would suffer risk of harm that would amount to hardship that is unusual and undeserved or disproportionate if he was required to apply for permanent residence in the normal manner."], ["[29]", "The Applicant had also not provided sufficient personal evidence to establish that he was homosexual or sufficient corroborative evidence to establish his homosexuality on the balance of probabilities (the evidence being the same as that submitted in support of his PRRA application) and, as a result, that he faces a risk to his life upon return to Algeria amounting to hardship sufficient to meet the H&C requirements."], ["[30]", "The Officer accepted the diagnoses of complex PTSD, OCD, and Tourette's.

To my mind, these findings are conclusions about Mr. Liban's credibility. They were central to his application.

The evidence as to his sexual orientation was central to that portion of his application claiming persecution or risk arising from same and the Officer's decision in that regard. The Officer stated that without sufficient evidence that the Applicant is homosexual, an assessment of the current country conditions does not establish that he is personally at risk in Algeria.

In fact, there is no evidence that the Officer turned his mind to the appropriateness of holding an oral hearing."], ["[12] Furthermore, it is clear, despite the respondent's submissions to the contrary, that credibility was central to the negative PRRA decision. In refusing to accord weight to the applicant's story without corroborating evidence, the PRRA Officer, in effect, concluded that the applicant was not credible. In my view, given these credibility concerns, it was incumbent on the Officer to consider the request for an oral hearing and to provide reasons for refusing to grant the request. The Officer's failure to do so in this case constitutes a breach of procedural fairness.

As the Officer repeatedly referred to this expectation it raises a reasonable apprehension that the Officer viewed this as a prerequisite or foundational factor to being granted a positive H&C exemption.

Efforts, plans, and goodwill, in the similar context of provision of state protection, are not enough. The Officer provided no analysis of whether the envisaged facilities to assist homeless individuals with mental illness had actually been set up or of the present situation. Of note is that an almost identical statement about future facilities was made in the previous 2008 UK Home Office report, apparently demonstrating that none of those plans came to fruition from then until 2011.

Accordingly, the Officer's findings on this issue were reasonable. Moreover, the Officer did not have to specifically assess whether the Applicant would be homeless in Algeria, just whether he presented evidence that he would be subject to undue hardship.

Liban était exposé à des risques."], ["[70]", "Dans le cas qui nous occupe, tout comme dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, la conclusion de l'agent quant à l'insuffisance de la preuve était en fait une conclusion portant sur la crédibilité du demandeur qui était peut-être influencée par l'audience à l'issue de laquelle l'asile lui avait été refusé treize ans auparavant, mais qui ne portait que sur la question de savoir si le demandeur était de confession juive."], ["[71]", "Par conséquent, l'affidavit souscrit par le demandeur soulève une question importante en ce qui concerne sa crédibilité. Les éléments de preuve concernant son orientation sexuelle étaient importants pour la demande dans laquelle il affirmait être persécuté ou être exposé à un risque en raison de ce fait et pour la décision que devait prendre l'agent à cet égard. L'agent a déclaré qu'à défaut d'éléments de preuve suffisants démontrant que le demandeur était homosexuel, son examen de la situation qui existait actuellement en Algérie ne permettait pas de conclure que le demandeur était personnellement exposé à un risque en Algérie. Vraisemblablement, compte tenu des éléments de preuve documentaires versés au dossier au sujet de la situation au pays, il faut en conclure que le témoignage du demandeur, à supposer qu'il soit admis, justifierait que la protection lui soit accordée. Compte tenu de la présence des facteurs énumérés à l'article 167, l'agent avait l'obligation de tenir une audience."], ["[72]", "Par ailleurs, par le biais de son conseil, le demandeur avait réclamé une audience advenant le cas où sa crédibilité serait remise en cause. Pourtant, rien dans la décision relative à la demande d'ERAR n'indique que l'agent a tenu compte de cette demande. Compte tenu de ce fait et de ma conclusion qu'il tirait en fait une conclusion sur la crédibilité, l'agent avait l'obligation d'examiner cette demande. Son omission à cet égard était déraisonnable, ainsi qu'il a été jugé dans la décision Z", "okai c Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration)", ", 2005 CF 1103, aux paragraphes 11 et 12:"], ["[11] Je reconnais avec le demandeur que les faits de l'espèce indiquent qu'il y a eu manquement à l'équité procédurale. Dans sa demande ERAR, le demandeur a présenté une demande détaillée en vue d'obtenir une audience, en faisant référence expressément aux facteurs énumérés à l'article 167 du Règlement. L'agent ERAR n'a toutefois aucunement mentionné ces facteurs, ni les autres facteurs qui l'ont amené à décider de ne pas tenir une audience, malgré la demande en ce sens présentée par écrit. En fait, il n'existe aucun élément qui indique que l'agent a examiné l'opportunité de tenir une audience."], ["[12] Qui plus est, il est évident, malgré les observations contraires présentées par le défendeur, que la crédibilité a joué un rôle central dans la décision ERAR défavorable. En refusant d'accorder toute force probante au récit du demandeur en l'absence de preuve le corroborant, l'agent ERAR a en fait conclu que le demandeur n'était pas digne de foi. J'estime que, compte tenu de ses doutes en matière de crédibilité, il incombait à l'agent d'examiner la demande d'audience et de motiver le refus d'en accorder une. L'omission par l'agent d'agir de cette façon en l'espèce constitue un manquement à l'équité procédurale. En outre, compte tenu des circonstances spéciales de la présente affaire pour ce qui est de la crédibilité, la Cour estime qu'une audience est appropriée."], ["[73]", "Pour les motifs exposés ci-dessus, la demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision relative à la demande d'ERAR est accueillie.", "Arguments et analyse - Décision relative à la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire", "Thèse du demandeur"], ["[74]", "Le demandeur soutient qu'en 2000, la Commission avait conclu que l'on ne pouvait se prononcer sur sa nationalité et l'avait considéré comme étant apatride. L'agent a pris acte de ce fait dans sa décision relative à la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire en indiquant qu'il est « apatride ».Comme l'agent a accepté que le demandeur était apatride que, dans l'affidavit souscrit le 19 juillet 2012 à l'appui de sa demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire le demandeur déclarait que, s'il était renvoyé en Algérie, il ne serait pas reconnu comme un citoyen et qu'on refuserait de l'admettre, il était déraisonnable de la part de l'agent de conclure que les agissements du demandeur l'empêchaient de se rendre en Algérie."], ["[75]", "L'agent a affirmé à deux reprises que, pour démontrer son établissement au Canada, le demandeur devait soumettre suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour démontrer qu'il pouvait raisonnablement s'attendre à ce qu'on lui permette d'y demeurer de façon permanente. On ne trouve nulle part ce critère dans le guide IP-5 ou dans la jurisprudence. La conclusion de l'agent suivant laquelle le demandeur n'avait pas satisfait à cette exigence a eu pour effet d'entraver de façon déraisonnable et injuste l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire. Comme l'agent a mentionné de façon répétée cette attente, on peut raisonnablement craindre que l'agent ait considéré qu'il s'agissait là d'une condition préalable ou d'un facteur essentiel à respecter pour pouvoir obtenir une mesure spéciale pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. De plus, ce que l'agent voulait dire par là était qu'on ne devait pas permettre au demandeur de profiter du fait qu'il se trouvait au Canada depuis si longtemps sans avoir pris les mesures nécessaires pour régulariser son statut d'immigrant."], ["[76]", "Selon le demandeur, dès lors que l'agent avait accepté qu'il souffrait de dépression, d'un trouble obsessivo-compulsif, d'un trouble de stress post-traumatique et du syndrome de Tourette et qu'il ne pouvait, de ce fait, travailler au Canada, il était déraisonnable de sa part de conclure qu'il pourrait se trouver un logement en Algérie. Cette conclusion reposait sur des documents portant sur des projets à venir du gouvernement algérien plutôt que sur des éléments de preuve concrets portant sur la situation actuelle. Les tentatives, les projets et la bonne volonté dans le contexte analogue de la protection de l'État ne suffisent pas. L'agent n'a fourni aucune analyse portant sur la question de savoir si les infrastructures envisagées pour venir en aide aux sans-abri atteints de troubles mentaux avaient été effectivement mises en place et il n'a pas analysé la situation actuelle. Il convient de signaler qu'une déclaration presque identique portant sur des projets semblables avait été formulée dans le rapport précédent de 2008 du Home Office du Royaume-Uni, ce qui démontre vraisemblablement qu'aucun de ces projets ne s'est concrétisé entre 2008 et 2011. L'agent a mal interprété la preuve et, par conséquent, a conclu, de façon déraisonnable que le demandeur serait en mesure de se trouver un logement en Algérie."], ["[77]", "Quant à la question de savoir si l'agent a ignoré ou mal interprété les éléments de preuve relatifs aux difficultés imputables au fait qu'il est Juif, le demandeur reprend essentiellement l'argument qu'il avait formulé dans sa demande d'ERAR en ce qui concerne les risques qui ont déjà été mentionnés. En d'autres termes, l'agent s'est uniquement demandé si le demandeur était Juif et non si les Algériens le percevraient comme un Juif. L'agent n'a pas examiné la lettre de M. Checroune dans ce contexte et il n'a donc pas analysé sous cet angle les difficultés auxquelles le demandeur pourrait être confronté. « Ben », qui signifie « fils de », fait partie d'un patronyme juif et est employé dans le même sens que « Bar » et, dans le cas des filles, « Bat »."], ["[78]", "Quant aux éléments de preuve corroborant l'orientation sexuelle du demandeur exigés par l'agent, le demandeur reprend essentiellement les arguments qu'il a formulés au sujet de la deuxième question que nous avons déjà mentionnée.", "Thèse du défendeur"], ["[79]", "Le défendeur soutient qu'il n'y a aucun élément de preuve objectif démontrant que le demandeur est apatride. Le demandeur n'a soumis aucune preuve concluante démontrant ce fait, par exemple, un document des autorités algériennes confirmant qu'elles ne reconnaissent pas sa citoyenneté. Par ailleurs, à la suite du rejet de sa demande d'asile en 2000, le demandeur n'a entrepris aucune démarche pour retourner en Algérie ou pour s'assurer que sa situation au Canada est en règle. Le demandeur n'a donc pas démontré que son degré d'établissement dépendait d'une situation indépendante de sa volonté ou qu'il pouvait raisonnablement s'attendre à ce qu'on lui permette de demeurer au Canada de façon permanente."], ["[80]", "Le défendeur affirme que l'agent n'a pas créé une nouvelle exigence à laquelle le demandeur devait satisfaire pour pouvoir obtenir une mesure spéciale fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire en déclarant que le demandeur n'avait pas fourni suffisamment d'éléments de preuve démontrant qu'il pouvait raisonnablement s'attendre à ce qu'on lui permette de demeurer au Canada de façon permanente. L'agent formulait simplement une observation, ce qui était conforme avec les principes sous-jacents en matière de motifs d'ordre humanitaire suivant lesquelles cette mesure est exceptionnelle et discrétionnaire."], ["[81]", "Le défendeur soutient qu'il incombait au demandeur de démontrer qu'il serait sans-abri en Algérie. Il affirme également que les éléments de preuve documentaires présentés par le demandeur n'ont pas convaincu l'agent parce qu'ils étaient insuffisants. La lettre du médecin canadien du demandeur ne précisait pas la raison pour laquelle le demandeur affirmait qu'il deviendrait probablement un sans-abri, et le médecin n'était pas un expert en ce qui concerne le système médical ou le système de logement algériens. Par conséquent, les conclusions tirées par l'agent sur cette question étaient raisonnables. De plus, l'agent n'était pas tenu d'aborder expressément la question de savoir si le demandeur deviendrait sans-abri en Algérie, mais seulement s'il avait présenté des éléments de preuve démontrant qu'il serait confronté à des difficultés excessives. La preuve documentaire versée au dossier n'a pas été mal interprétée; elle indiquait plutôt qu'il existait en Algérie des établissements offrant des soins en santé mentale. L'argument du demandeur suivant lequel il faut évaluer l'efficacité opérationnelle des établissements de santé mentale contredit la jurisprudence et ne s'applique pas."], ["[82]", "Le défendeur affirme que les seuls éléments de preuve qui ont été présentés au sujet de la présumée identité juive du demandeur étaient ses propres assertions ainsi que la lettre de M.

Checroune indiquait que [traduction] « le nom [du demandeur] est un nom juif de l'Afrique du Nord (Algérie) »; l'agent a toutefois estimé que cela n'était pas suffisant pour démontrer que le demandeur serait pour autant exposé à un risque. On ne peut reprocher à l'agent de ne pas avoir examiné plus à fond un argument fondé sur l'apparente identité juive du demandeur alors que la preuve ne démontrait pas l'existence de cette identité."], ["[83]", "De plus, les arguments formulés au sujet des motifs d'ordre humanitaire ne mentionnent pas le fait qu'à lui seul, le nom de famille du demandeur permettrait de l'identifier comme Juif, et cette question n'avait de toute façon pas été portée à l'attention de l'agent.

Même si un témoignage est donné sous serment, l'agent peut quand même estimer qu'il n'est pas suffisant pour établir les faits pour lesquels il est soumis, et ce, sans pour autant se prononcer sur la crédibilité. L'agent n'a pas formulé de conclusion au sujet de la crédibilité, mais a estimé que la preuve était insuffisante. Les conclusions de l'agent portaient sur la valeur de la preuve.", "Analyse", "4.", "Le pouvoir discrétionnaire de l'agent a-t-il été entravé?"], ["[85]", "La question qui se pose est celle de savoir si l'agent a entravé de façon déraisonnable l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire en exigeant du demandeur qu'il démontre qu'il pouvait « raisonnablement s'attendre » à ce qu'on lui permette de demeurer au Canada de façon permanente, ainsi que le passage suivant des déclarations de l'agent le laisse entrevoir: [traduction] « [...] Je ne suis pas convaincu que le demandeur peut raisonnablement s'attendre à ce qu'on lui permette de demeurer au Canada de façon permanente, compte tenu de ses antécédents en matière d'immigration » et: « On ne m'a pas soumis suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour démontrer qu'il pouvait raisonnablement s'attendre à ce qu'on lui permette de demeurer au Canada de façon permanente »."], ["[86]", "Quiconque réclame la mesure exceptionnelle et discrétionnaire qui peut être accordée en vertu du paragraphe 25(1) de la LIPR doit justifier cette mesure par des considérations d'ordre humanitaire se rapportant à sa situation.

La présentation d'éléments de preuve tendant à démontrer que le demandeur « s'attendait raisonnablement » à ce qu'on lui permette de demeurer au Canada ne constitue pas une condition préalable ou un critère fondamental, pas plus qu'une condition que le demandeur doit respecter pour démontrer qu'il serait confronté à des difficultés. Par conséquent, si l'agent avait considéré qu'il s'agissait là d'une condition ou d'un critère et avait refusé la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire pour cause d'insuffisance d'éléments de preuve établissant l'existence d'une telle attente raisonnable, l'agent aurait commis une erreur de droit."], ["[87]", "Cependant, après avoir examiné l'ensemble de la décision relative à la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, je ne suis pas convaincue que l'agent a appliqué un critère d' « attente raisonnable » comme condition préalable ou critère à satisfaire pour en arriver à la conclusion qu'il ne disposait pas de suffisamment d'éléments de preuve démontrant que le demandeur avait réussi son établissement au Canada au point où il subirait des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives s'il devait être obligé de quitter le Canada pour présenter sa demande de résidence permanente. J'estime plutôt que, compte tenu des antécédents en matière d'immigration du demandeur et de son degré d'établissement au Canada, l'agent constatait que le demandeur n'avait entrepris aucune démarche pour démontrer qu'il était apatride. S'il l'avait fait, l'agent aurait alors pu tenir compte de ce facteur d'intégration favorable, en supposant que le demandeur ait démontré que la situation qui l'obligeait à demeurer au Canada était indépendante de sa volonté."], ["[88]", "Il est vrai que la formulation choisie par l'agent aurait pu être plus heureuse, mais l'agent n'a pas, à mon avis, entravé l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire en tenant compte du degré d'établissement du demandeur au Canada.", "5.", "La décision de l'agent était-elle déraisonnable?"], ["[89]", "S'agissant d'évaluer le degré d'établissement du demandeur au Canada et des risques qu'il se retrouve sans abri en Algérie, l'agent a reconnu et accepté que le demandeur se trouvait au Canada depuis 1999, qu'il avait fait beaucoup de bénévolat au cours des ans et qu'il avait présenté des éléments de preuve corroborant ces faits. Il a également reconnu et accepté que le demandeur avait forgé des liens avec la collectivité au Canada et qu'il ne pouvait compter sur aucun soutien ni aucune famille en Algérie.

Binnie, J., wrote at paragraphs 1, and 28 to 32:", "\"1. BINNIE, J.:- An Anton Piller order bears an uncomfortable resemblance to a private search warrant. No notice is given to the party against whom it is issued. Indeed, defendants usually first learn of them when they are served and executed, without having had an opportunity to challenge them or the evidence on which they were granted. The defendant may have no idea a claim is even pending. The order is not placed in the hands of a public authority for execution, but authorizes a private party to insist on entrance to the premises of its opponent to conduct a surprise search, the purpose of which is to seize and preserve evidence to further its claim in a private dispute. The only justification for such an extraordinary remedy is that the plaintiff has a strong prima facie case and can demonstrate that on the facts, absent such an order, there is a real possibility relevant evidence will be destroyed or otherwise made to disappear. The protection of the party against whom an Anton Piller order is issued ought to be threefold: a carefully drawn order which identifies the material to be seized and sets out safeguards to deal, amongst other things, with privileged documents; a vigilant court-appointed supervising solicitor who is independent of the parties; and a sense of responsible self-restraint on the part of those executing the order.", ". . . . .", "\"28. Anton Piller orders have been available in Canada for close to 30 years. Unlike a search warrant they do not authorize forcible entry, but expose the target to contempt proceedings unless permission to enter is given. To the ordinary citizen faced on his or her doorstep with an Anton Piller order this may be seen as a distinction without a meaningful difference.", "\"29. Originally developed as an 'exceptional remedy' in the context of trade secrets and intellectual property disputes, such orders are now fairly routinely issued in ordinary civil disputes ...\""], ["[7]", "The Anton Piller Order originated from a decision of the English Court of Appeal in a case of that name", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  motors used in computers, had evidence from two former employees of the Defendant that the Defendant was stealing the Plaintiff's trade secrets and would be likely to destroy evidence to that effect if it had notice. The Court gave an Order permitting the Plaintiff to request that the Defendant allow an inspection of its premises for the purpose of finding and securing such evidence. Refusal by the Defendant to allow such entry and inspection would be a contempt of court. The extraordinary nature of this Order was specifically addressed by Lord Denning M.R. at page 61 where he wrote:", "\"This is not covered by the", "Rules", "of the Supreme Court and must be based on the inherent jurisdiction of the court. There are one or two old precedents which give some colour for it,", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , an Irish case. But they do not go very far. So it falls to us to consider it on principle. It seems to me that such an order can be made by a judge ex parte, but it should only be made where it is essential that the plaintiff should have inspection so that justice can be done between the parties: and when, if the defendant were forewarned, there is a grave danger that vital evidence will be destroyed, that papers will be burnt or lost or hidden, or taken beyond the jurisdiction, and so the ends of justice be defeated: and when the inspection would do no real harm to the defendant or his case.", "\"Nevertheless, in the enforcement of this order, the plaintiffs must act with due circumspection. On the service of it, the plaintiffs should be attended by their solicitor, who is an officer of the court. They should give the defendants an opportunity of considering it and of consulting with their own solicitor. If the defendants wish to apply to discharge the order as having been improperly obtained, they must be allowed to do so.

The following are excerpts from that paper. Prof. Berryman begins at page 2:", "Rolling Anton Piller Orders", "\"It is difficult to discern a definite point in time when the rolling Anton Piller order was created in Canada although it is uniquely a creation of the Federal Court. Canada's Federal Court is a statutory court created pursuant to the constitutional powers accorded the Federal government to establish courts for the 'better administration of the laws of Canada'. Under the constitutional division of powers the Federal government has the exclusive responsibility to create and regulate copyright and patents, and pursuant to the trade and commerce power, to make provision for trademarks. While the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, and the reasons for maintaining it as a separate court, have often been challenged throughout its 126 year history, most critics have accepted the desire to have a specialist tribunal deal with, among other things, intellectual property as a valid reason for the court's continued existence. Pursuant to this specialized nature the Federal Court, during the eighties, built up a significant Anton Piller jurisdiction the majority of which involve breaches of copyright and trademark.\""], ["[13]", "I move to the end of that paper where, at page 13 Prof. Berryman wrote:", "Evaluation of the Federal Court's Position on Rolling Anton Piller Orders", "\"'New millennium', 'post-industrial', 'globalization', and the 'knowledge economy' are all terms often placed within close proximity to one another. Taken together they mark a paradigm shift in the underlying economic basis of western democracies. Information, knowledge, brand names and consumers associative memories that go with this material to generate goodwill, as well as the manipulation of the same, increasingly forms the main assets of modern enterprises. This new form of property is distinguished by one major characteristic, that it is capable of multiple use without a corresponding deprivation of use by the lawful owner. Thus, the primary wealth in the property is its 'use' value that can only be protected by remedies aimed at exclusion of others. The common law's presumptive remedy, damages, is substitutionary in effect, measuring and trading the plaintiff's loss for a damages equivalent. Equity's presumptive remedy, the injunction, is exclusionary in effect. Thus, as the knowledge economy takes hold, we can only expect an increasing reliance upon exclusionary remedies. The Federal Court's rolling order is a natural growth of this trend but it also portends other changes.\"", "At page 14 he points out that the Federal Court is, in effect, filling in gaps in legislation:", "\"By virtue of its statutory jurisdiction Canada's Federal Court has received the vast majority of Anton Piller suits. The court's cautious development has occurred at a time when the Federal government has spent considerable time in legislating changes to Canada's intellectual property statutes including the remedial provisions. Thus, the legislature has had the opportunity to address concerns with the direction that the court has been taking.", "\"Certainly, one would expect and hope that government's legal advisors were aware of legislative initiatives in the United Kingdom during this period. On the other hand, the fact that the legislature did not make specific provision for a self-help right of seizure, as the United Kingdom had done with copyright in 1988, may cause pause for a court and whether it should 'gap fill' legislation. In this sense the Federal Court has been caught in a quandary over a lacuna in Canadian law.\"", "The \"Rolling Order\" has never been fully litigated, a problem that concerned Professor Berryman as he wrote at page 15:", "\"A common feature in most jurisdictions that have developed the Anton Piller order, but perhaps more so in Canada's Federal Court, have been the relative paucity of either 'strong' or willing defendants to mount concerted actions against the order. The conditions in which adjudication takes place are thus less than ideal. In Canada the number of plaintiffs, and their counsel engaged in arguing before the Federal Court, have been small in number. From a plaintiff's point of view, significant advances have been made, but have these been matched by sufficiently vigorous arguments for defendants?", ". . . . .", "\"Rolling Anton Piller orders and the exclusionary remedy they provide are both a work in progress and a principle derived from adjudication. The remedy is responsive to plaintiffs needs; it remains to be seen whether it proves to be an inconvenience along the way to a better developed set of coherent decision making principles.

The second is more insidious. An Anton Piller Order is to be granted only where there is grave danger that relevant material may be destroyed. For a plaintiff simply to allege that a defendant may destroy relevant material, obtain an Order, secure some material by a surprise search, then return to the Court with the material in hand should not mean that the fact that such material has been obtained can now be used as proof of the likelihood that it would have been destroyed. Such later acquired material may be evidence of the existence of such material, but not evidence that it would likely have been destroyed. Evidence as to the general conduct of a Defendant whose premises are being searched should be used with extreme caution when attempting to use such \"post Order\" evidence to support the \"pre Order\" assertion that the materials sought would likely be destroyed.

It is, after all, the plaintiff's valuable property which it is sought to protect. If the officers of the plaintiff are not in a position to testify from their own personal knowledge as to the nature and extent of the problem, doubts are raised as to the need for the remedy. While counsel who habitually practice in this area no doubt acquire expertise and insight into the practices of counterfeiters, the unusually heavy reliance upon information provided by counsel which one often sees in these matters creates a risk of putting counsel's credibility in issue. This detracts from the independence which the Court is entitled to expect from counsel appearing before it.", "2) Certain elements of the proof put before the Court are general in nature and cannot be easily be particularized, for example, the damage to the goodwill of the plaintiff from the existence of substandard counterfeit goods. This evidence can be given in the form of general statements of the plaintiff's understanding of the effect of counterfeiting upon the value of their intellectual properties.", "3) Other elements of the proof can and should be particularized, specifically the instances of counterfeiting known to the plaintiff which would justify the granting of an order. In general it would not be sufficient to simply say that the plaintiff is aware of counterfeiting in a given city or region. Since these orders are applied for ex parte and often in camera, there is no obvious justification for not giving the Court particulars of known instances of counterfeiting which would justify the issuance of the order sought, especially when the counterfeiting activity is taking place at some distance from the centre where the order is sought.", "4) In general, a number of instances of counterfeiting would be required to justify a 'rolling' order for the simple reason that a specific instance would only justify a specific order. If the plaintiff wishes an order applicable to unlimited future instances, it is incumbent upon it to demonstrate that specific orders are not an appropriate remedy. The deponent's unsupported testimony as to his or her belief that such an order is required would not usually be sufficient.", "5) In the same way, proof of a number of incidents of counterfeiting in Ontario would only justify an order which applied to Ontario. If a Canada wide order is sought, there should be some proof that the counterfeiting is not a local problem. This is not an insurmountable problem: an order tailored to the evidence submitted at the time of the hearing could be extended subsequently by amendment if further evidence of counterfeiting in other provinces or regions became available.", "6) Since it is the allegation of counterfeiting which justifies the extraordinary interference with existing property rights, the grounds upon which it is believed that counterfeiting is occurring should be clearly stated. A simple assertion that the affiant believes the goods to be counterfeit is not sufficient. What observations or examinations support the affiant's belief? In general terms, evidence upon information and belief as to this issue would not be particularly persuasive. This evidence goes to the heart of the application and should receive critical attention.", "7) In those cases where it is sought to renew an existing order, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to demonstrate to the court the use which it has made of the order previously granted. An order which has not been enforced does not need to be renewed but the fact of enforcement does not, of itself, justify renewal of the order, though it may in some cases. As a courtesy to the Court, this information should be collated and summarized so as to enable the court to quickly review the plaintiff's past experience.", "8) An assertion in an affidavit that the plaintiff agrees to be bound by an undertaking as to damages is not an undertaking as to damages just as a promise to agree is not an agreement.

While counsel who habitually practice in this area no doubt acquire expertise and insight into the practices of counterfeiters, the unusually heavy reliance upon information provided by counsel which one often sees in these matters creates a risk of putting counsel's credibility in issue.

Damages can either be proved or an election to take statutory damages made. An injunction can extend to works not specifically put in issue.

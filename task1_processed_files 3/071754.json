These are activities which I characterize as extraordinary because, if I might so phrase it, they have been criminalized by the international community collectively for exceptional reasons, and their nature is described in international instruments (Article 1F(a)) or in terms of such instruments (Article 1F(c)). One feature of some of these activities is that they affect communities and are conducted through persons who do not necessarily participate directly in them. In order for the persons who really are responsible to be held to account, the international community wished responsibility to attach to the persons, for example, on whose orders the activities were carried out or who, aware of their existence, deliberately closed their eyes to the fact that they were taking place. It is in these circumstances that the concept of complicity by association developed, making it possible to reach the persons responsible who would probably not have been responsible under traditional criminal law. Fundamentally, this concept is one of international criminal law.\"", "Therefore, in order to understand this concept derived from international criminal law (in the context of the Schedule to the", "IRPA", ", which refers to the", "Convention", "), we must look to the Federal Court of Appeal's jurisprudence."], ["[13]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the Court held that it is possible to commit a crime against humanity within the meaning of section F(a) as an accomplice."], ["[14]", "Certain benchmarks derived from the case-law make it possible to determine whether a person has committed a crime against humanity by complicity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 302 N.R. 178; 2003 FCA 39, at paragraph 19, Mr. Justice Décary wrote:", "\"As the Court noted in", "Bazargan", "at 286, membership in a group makes it easier to conclude that there was 'personal and knowing participation' - which remains the first test - than when there was no membership, but the difference affects the evidence, not the principles. Counsel for the respondent would like the Court to clarify what is meant by 'membership in a group'. I do not think this is necessary. The expression was used in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in the context of a member whom the Court described as 'active'. The expression suggests the existence of an institutional link between the organization and the person, accompanied by a more than nominal commitment to the organization's activities. As everything is a question of fact, at the end of the analysis I feel that it is better to speak in terms of participation in the group's activities than of membership in the group.\""], ["[15]", "After reviewing the facts in the record, I have no doubt that the applicant personally and knowingly participated in the crime against humanity committed by the Salvadoran Army with respect to the civilian population of that country.

He knew full well that the Air Force kept on bombing the civilian population and was fully aware of the link between his work and those bombings. He still decided to stay in his job for economic reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  an important factor to consider is evidence that the individual protested against the crime or tried to stop its commission or attempted to withdraw from the organization.

For ease of reference, the four family members will be referred to as follows in this decision: Jose Roberto Carias Martinez (the father); Marta Lidia Juarez Pereira de Carias (the mother); Jose Roberto Carias Juarez (the elder son); and Fernando Carias Juarez (the younger son). The claims of the father, mother and elder son rest upon the younger son's involvement in the investigation of corrupt Honduran police and army officers who had been involved in a car theft ring. The applicants claim to have been threatened and persecuted due to the younger son's involvement in the investigation. The father and mother alleged a fear of persecution on the basis of their membership in a particular social group, namely, the Carias family. The elder son alleged a fear of persecution due to his membership in three social groups: the army, Christians and the Carias family. The younger son alleged a fear of persecution due to his anti-government opinion, which was based upon his investigations of corrupt Honduran officials."], ["[4]", "The father described the basis of his claim in the narrative portion of his Personal Information Form (PIF), which was filed in October 2003. He stated that his perception as a relatively wealthy individual caused him problems. In 1997, his elder son was abducted and a ransom was requested. He paid the ransom and his son was released. He continued to be targeted by an organized gang, but could not go to the authorities because the perpetrators were connected to the police. He was advised by a friend not to make any complaints to the police. He paid the gang regularly but on May 6, 2003, they beat him and left him semi-conscious. He left Honduras for the United States on June 27, 2003. He then made his way to Canada on October 7, 2003, where he claimed refugee protection. During the hearing, he testified that his daughter Melisa, who was still in Honduras, was being threatened and assaulted due to his younger son's investigations. The mother did not provide her own PIF narrative, and instead relied upon those of her family in alleging her fear of persecution. She left Honduras on November 27, 2003, and arrived in Canada via the United States on December 9, 2003, where she immediately claimed refugee protection."], ["[5]", "The elder son described his fear of persecution in his PIF narrative, which was filed in October 2003. He was a member of the Honduran army from 1984 until 1994, when he became a teacher. He was harassed for having deserted the army. He was also harassed for being a Christian, when he became a minister. The elder son later determined that those harassing him were gang members. In November 1997, he was abducted by a gang. During his abduction, he was allegedly beaten and tortured. His father paid a ransom and he was released after three days. He fled to the United States on December 3, 1997, where he remained legally until he joined his father in Canada in October 2003, and claimed refugee status."], ["[6]", "The younger son was an investigations agent in the Direction of Criminal Investigation (DIC). His PIF, dated January 2004, set out the reasons for which he feared persecution in Honduras. In 1998, he became the head of the automotive theft department. Following a number of car thefts, his department arrested members of a car theft ring. He and his family experienced death threats, harassment and attempted murder due to his involvement in the investigations. He claimed that his house was set on fire and gunshots were fired, a bomb exploded in his car, his dogs were killed, and he received a phone call threatening him with death unless he stopped the investigations."], ["[7]", "The younger son reported his investigations to his immediate supervisors, however they did not respond, as they were corrupt. Eventually his report was given to senior government officials whom the younger son believed were receiving payoffs. He was allegedly abducted on July 25, 2002, and tortured over a period of two days. His abductors warned him to stop his investigations or that his family would be killed. He took a two month leave of absence and did not pursue the investigations when he returned to work. In December 2002, he received a telephone call from the Honduran Minister of Defence wherein he was asked to leave the country and threatened with death. He agreed to leave if his wife and child would be protected. He relocated his family within Honduras and fled to the United States in January 2003. He was later informed by his mother that there had been an abduction attempt upon his child. He came to Canada on December 9, 2003 and claimed refugee status."], ["[8]", "The applicants jointly filed a supplemental PIF narrative in August 2004. The supplementary information indicated that the younger son had been contacted by phone in 1997 when the elder son had been abducted, and was told that the abduction had been ordered by those he had been investigating. The applicants' refugee hearings took place on August 24, 2004, May 5, 2005, September 14, 2005, and October 17, 2005.

I find that the verbal harassment of the second claimant is not a serious form of harm and that it happened over ten years ago and, therefore, it does not contribute to establishing an objective basis of future harm for any of the claimants.", "The other five incidents took place between 1996 and 2005. Five different family members experienced five different types of economic and/or violent crimes. According to the testimony of the first claimant, the Carias family is perceived as being well-off. The claimants' PIFs indicate that they were largely employed in various professional capacities in Honduras; for example, as an agronomist, teacher, airplane mechanic and investigations agent. The documentary evidence indicates that about two-thirds of the country's households live in poverty and forty per cent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day. In this context, I find that the Carias family members would be perceived as a relatively wealthy and, thus, prime victims for economically motivated crimes.", "The documentary evidence indicates that crime and violence is on the rise in Honduras. Amnesty International reports that \"the socio-economic conditions, the poverty that affects a high percentage of the whole population, the ineffectiveness of and lack of confidence in the legal system and police force have all created great insecurity among the population in general. These conditions have \"prompt[ed] many to flee the country.\"", "I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants, and other Carias family members still in Honduras, have been victims of random and isolated economic, and sometimes violent, crimes over the last decade as a result of the rising crime rates in Honduras. Thus, I find that these incidents do not demonstrate that there is a reasonable chance that the first, second, third or fourth claimants will be personally subjected to a risk to their lives or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in Honduras.", "CONCLUSION", "I find that there is not a reasonable chance that the claimants will be persecuted or will be personally subjected to a risk to their lives or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or be at a risk of torture for the reasons outlined above. Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that the first, second, third and fourth claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection and, therefore, rejects their claims to refugee protection.", "Issue"], ["[13]", "The applicants submitted the following issue for consideration:", "Did the Board err in failing to apply its finding that the applicants were prime targets because of their perceived wealth, to its assessment of whether they would be at risk in Honduras?"], ["[14]", "I would rephrase the issue as follows:", "Did the Board err in finding that the applicants were not persons in need of protection under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of IRPA?", "Applicants' Submissions"], ["[15]", "The applicants submitted that the Board erred in law in failing to consider their status as prime targets of crime, their experiences as a result of this targeting, and the personal risk they faced in Honduras.

This cannot be so.", "The risk described by the Applicants and the Board in this case is a risk faced by millions of Colombians; indeed, all Colombians who have or will have children are members of this population. It is difficult to define a broader or more general group within a nation than the group consisting of \"parents\".", "Further, I can see nothing in s. 97(1)(b)(ii) that requires the Board to interpret \"generally\" as applying to all citizens. The word \"generally\" is commonly used to mean \"prevalent\" or \"widespread\".

Mr. Shukurov challenges the dismissal by the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [the RAD] of his appeal of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division [the RPD]. The RPD determined that Mr. Shukurov was neither a Convention refugee within the meaning of s 96 of the IRPA nor a person in need of protection as defined in s 97(1) of the IRPA."], ["[2]", "For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the RAD applied the wrong standard of review to the RPD's decision and the wrong test to determine the admissibility of additional evidence submitted on appeal.

His claim for refugee protection was based on the following contentions:", "• Mr. Shukurov was employed as a hotel manager in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. In January, 2013, a police officer called to reserve the hotel's pool and sauna in order to entertain his guests. Mr. Shukurov complied and made a note of the reservation.", "• The owner of the hotel saw the reservation and recognized the name of the police officer. Based on previous experience, the owner was concerned that the police officer would not pay for the use of the pool and sauna. The owner therefore arranged for signs to be placed indicating that both were out of service.", "• When the police officer arrived with his guests and discovered that he would not be able to use the sauna or the pool, he became angry with Mr. Shukurov. Mr. Shukurov, who was unaware of the hotel owner's actions, could offer no explanation.", "• Two days after the incident, the police officer demanded the equivalent of $5,000 from Mr. Shukurov as \"compensation\" for the embarrassment he had suffered in front of his guests. When Mr. Shukurov objected, the police officer threatened to bring false criminal charges against him.", "• Mr. Shukurov complied with the police officer's demands with an initial payment of $1,000. The police officer indicated that he expected the balance to be paid in instalments of $500 every month.", "• Mr. Shukurov approached another police officer and a state prosecutor to explain his predicament and to lodge a complaint. He was told by these officials that a complaint would be futile and that the police officer would be protected by other public officials, as this kind of extortion was commonplace.", "• Mr. Shukurov then decided to leave the country. He applied for a Canadian visa on February 24, 2013. Mr. Shukurov continued to make monthly payments to the police officer until he arrived in Canada on May 14, 2013."], ["[4]", "Mr. Shukurov made a refugee claim on June 13, 2013. His claim was rejected by the RPD on November 21, 2013. Mr. Shukurov then appealed the decision to the RAD. The appeal was dismissed on July 28, 2014."], ["[5]", "Mr. Shukurov brought an application for leave and for judicial review in this Court on August 11, 2014. Leave was granted on March 12, 2015.", "III.", "The RAD's Decision"], ["[6]", "Mr. Shukurov submitted a number of additional documents in support of his appeal in accordance with s 110(4) of the IRPA. The RAD relied on this Court's decision in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED to reject all but one of these documents due to its concerns about their provenance and authenticity. The appeal was therefore heard on the basis of the record of proceedings before the RPD, the submissions of the parties, the testimony of Mr. Shukurov, and one additional document."], ["[7]", "Mr. Shukurov argued before the RAD that the RPD's decision was flawed in three respects: a) the RPD's finding that there was no nexus between the risk faced by Mr. Shukurov and the grounds for refugee status contained in the Convention; b) the RPD's negative credibility assessment based on a lack of corroborative evidence; and c) adverse inferences made by the RPD due to inconsistencies in Mr. Shukurov's oral evidence and its rejection of Mr. Shukurov's explanations for those inconsistencies."], ["[8]", "The RAD referred to the decision of this Court in", "Iyamuremye c Canada (Ministre de Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration)", ", 2014 CF 494 [", "Iyamuremye", "] in support of its conclusion that the standard of review to be applied to appeals that involve mixed questions of fact and law is reasonableness."], ["[9]", "The RPD found there to be no nexus between the risk faced by Mr. Shukurov and the criteria for refugee protection because the police officer's threats and extortion did not amount to persecution within the meaning of the Convention. In reviewing this finding, the RAD noted that Mr. Shukurov had not expressed any views regarding police corruption that could be perceived as political opinion against the government. Furthermore, the evidence submitted by Mr. Shukurov to demonstrate that he was a \"wanted person\" in Uzbekistan was found by the RPD not to be credible. The RAD concluded that the RPD's determination was reasonable."], ["[10]", "The RAD then considered the RPD's adverse finding regarding Mr. Shukurov's credibility. The RAD observed that the RPD had identified a number of questions regarding the provenance of the documents submitted by Mr. Shukurov, including how he came to receive them in Canada. The RAD concluded that it was reasonable for the RPD to insist on corroborative evidence, and to assign little or no probative value to the documents when this was not forthcoming. The RAD accepted that the absence of corroborative documentation would not, in itself, be a reason to reject Mr. Shukurov's credibility. However, combined with the inconsistencies in Mr. Shukurov's oral testimony, the RAD once again found the RPD's conclusion to be reasonable."], ["[11]", "Finally, the RAD noted that Mr. Shukurov was given an opportunity by the RPD to dispel its concerns. However, Mr. Shukurov was unable to recall key facts because he had \"forgotten\" them. The RAD concluded that it was open to the RPD to find that Mr. Shukurov's account of events was not reasonable and to expect medical reports if Mr. Shukurov was suffering from memory loss."], ["[12]", "The RAD confirmed the determination of the RPD that Mr. Shukurov was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to ss 96 and 97 of the IRPA, and dismissed the appeal.", "IV.", "Issues"], ["[13]", "The following issues are raised by this application for judicial review:", "A.

This is also the thrust of Justice Shore's decision in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, where he notes that in cases involving findings of pure credibility, the point is not which standard was applied but rather \"whether the RAD conducted an independent assessment of the evidence as a whole.\" I am therefore of the view that the RAD's obligation to conduct an independent assessment of the evidence extends to questions of credibility; although where no hearing is held before the RAD, deference may be owed to credibility findings of the RPD that are based on a witness' conduct before the panel (", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[17]", "In this case, the RAD said the following about the standard of review it should apply to decisions of the RPD:", "[...] counsel submitted that \"the RPD is required to (re-) consider the evidence filed at the RPD and form its own opinion to assess the decision\". It would appear that counsel meant to say that the RAD is to consider the totality of the evidence. I concur if that is what the Appellant has submitted.", "In this case, the issues are to be considered on the standard of reasonableness.

I am not persuaded that the RAD properly understood its obligation to conduct a full, fact-based assessment of Mr. Shukurov's claim.

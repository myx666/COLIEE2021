The issue is whether on the facts before him, the visa officer's conclusion is unreasonable. I have not been persuaded that it is. The visa officer did not, in my view, rely on irrelevant or extraneous considerations in arriving at his conclusion. The fact that the visa officer considered the illegal traffic in women prevalent in the Eastern block countries and that short-term students made refugee claims in Canada, does not, in my view, constitute an error. These considerations of local conditions coupled with those considerations more personal to the Applicant, were part of the broader picture which the visa officer had to assess in reaching his conclusion.", "The visa officer considered the personal situation of the Applicant in the context of the prevailing conditions and circumstances of the Ukraine.

Muldoon provided some general guidance in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 50:", "The first factor identified by the Court in Baker is the closeness of the administrative process to the judicial process. The more the determinations which must be made to reach a decision resemble judicial decision making, the more likely it is that procedural protections closer to the trial model will be required by the duty of fairness. The processing of student authorization applications by a visa officer is highly administrative and does not resemble judicial decision-making. This factor militates in favour of more relaxed requirements under the duty of fairness.", "The second factor is the nature of the statutory scheme pursuant to which the body operates. Greater protections will be required when no appeal procedure is provided within the statute, or when the decision is determinative of the issue. For student applications, an unsuccessful applicant can seek a remedy in this Court by judicial review. This militates in favour of more relaxed procedural requirements.", "The third factor in determining the nature and extent of the duty of fairness owed is the importance of the decision to the individuals affected. The more important the decision is to their lives and the greater its impact on those persons, the more stringent the procedural protections mandated. A negative decision means that the applicant will be unable to study in Canada for a temporary period. The individual is free to apply again in the future. Therefore, this factor militates in favour of more relaxed procedural requirements.", "The fourth factor is the legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision. If the claimant has a legitimate expectation that a certain procedure will be followed, it will be required by the duty of fairness. Nevertheless, this doctrine is does not create substantive rights. An applicant for a student authorization does not have a legitimate expectation regarding the procedure followed in processing the application.", "Finally, the analysis of what procedures the duty of fairness requires should also take into account and respect the choices of procedure made by the agency itself, particularly when the statute leaves to the decision-maker the ability to choose the procedures, or when the agency has an expertise in determining what procedures are appropriate. The Immigration Act does not require that a particular procedure be followed in processing student authorizations. Considering the large number of student authorization applications which are processed, the procedure adopted by the Embassy should be respected.", "In balancing the factors in Baker, the procedural requirements mandated by the duty of fairness should be relaxed for the processing of applications for student authorizations by visa officers overseas. Therefore, there are no grounds to argue unfairness in this process because a visa officer did not communicate all of her concerns to the applicant, or that she did not accord the applicant an opportunity to respond to those concerns."], ["[33]", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Federal Court of Appeal addressed the factors that limit the content of the duty of fairness in cases such as this one:", "The factors tending to limit the content of the duty in the case at bar include: the absence of a legal right to a visa; the imposition on the applicant of the burden of establishing eligibility for a visa; the less serious impact on the individual that the refusal of a visa typically has, compared with the removal of a benefit, such as continuing residence in Canada; and the fact that the issue in dispute in this case (namely, the nature of the services that Abdullah is likely to require in Canada and whether they would constitute an excessive demand) is not one that the applicant is particularly well placed to address.", "Finally, when setting the content of the duty of fairness appropriate for the determination of visa applications, the Court must guard against imposing a level of procedural formality that, given the volume of applications that visa officers are required to process, would unduly encumber efficient administration. The public interest in containing administrative costs and in not hindering expeditious decision-making must be weighed against the benefits of participation in the process by the person directly affected."], ["[34]", "Justice Robert L. Barnes also addressed these issues in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :", "In this case, the Respondent was dealing with one of several thousand visa applications it receives in Beijing each month. Its practices in the rendering of decisions are a reflection of the workloads associated with this process. Whatever the merits of her application, the Applicant had no right to enter Canada. The fairness duty to provide reasons in a context like this would be at the lower end of detail and formality and, in my view, the reasons provided to the Applicant were sufficient to meet that legal obligation."], ["[35]", "It is also well recognized that, to use the words of Justice Judith Snider in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"the decision on an application for a temporary student authorization is not judicial or quasi-judicial in nature.\""], ["[36]", "It has to be borne in mind that the onus was on the Applicant to meet the evidentiary burden of satisfying the Officer that she would leave Canada at the end of her authorized stay. The words of Justice Luc Martineau in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> should be kept in mind:", "The applicant's arguments are unconvincing. Case law teaches that where an applicant fails to meet the evidentiary onus of satisfying the Visa Officer that they will leave Canada at the end of their authorized stay, an interview is not a statutory requirement. It is the applicants who bears the onus of providing visa officers with thorough applications in the first place ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [Bollina ] ). Generally, where an officer has extrinsic information of which the applicant is unaware, an opportunity to respond should be made available to the applicant to disabuse the officer of any concerns arising from that evidence ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). A similar exception is found where the officer's conclusion is based on a subjective consideration rather that on objective evidence (Bollina, above, at para 27;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This is not the case here. In this instance, the Visa Officer relied only on materials submitted by or known to the applicant and so he was not required to conduct an interview. By themselves, the expired bank note, the lack of any other financial records or documentation to confirm residency and registration, are relevant to assess financial capability and his degree of establishment in China (for example, the applicant does not own a house in China). Thus, no reviewable error has been made in this regard by the Visa Officer."], ["[37]", "Likewise, the words of Justice Russel Zinn in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> re equally applicable to the case before me:", "I find that there is no merit to the submission that the officer ought to have provided the applicant with an opportunity to address his concerns. Justice Russell in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  reviewed the law as to when a visa officer ought to provide such an opportunity. Relying on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  he noted firstly that there was no statutory right to an interview, or any dialogue of the sort suggested here. Secondly, it was noted that generally an opportunity to respond is available only when the officer has information of which the applicant is not aware. As in Ling, that is not the situation here and thus no opportunity was required to be given to Mr. Singh to address the officer's concerns. Further, when as here the officer is relying only on materials submitted by or known to the applicant, there is no need for an interview."], ["[38]", "Although the duty of fairness is minimal in this situation, there is certainly jurisprudence from the Court to the effect that where an immigration officer has concerns with respect to the credibility or the genuineness of documents, the officer should provide the applicant with an opportunity to respond to such concerns.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above."], ["[39]", "In the present case, however, it is clear from the GCMS Notes that there were several important factors relied upon to doubt whether the Applicant would return to Iraq or Jordan after coming to Canada. In the affidavit submitted by the Officer for this application - which, in my view, is admissible because it simply elaborates on the reasons in the notes and is not an attempt to go beyond the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) - the Officer says that, even without his concerns over the genuineness of the Abbas Letter, he would still have not been persuaded of the Applicant's", "bona fides", ". When I review the GCMS Notes and the other factors at play in the application, I am convinced that this is the case. In fact, in the Decision itself the Officer says \"If this is indeed a genuine document, then it appears that the employer is not a well-established company.\" I think the Officer is making it clear that, quite apart from the issue of whether the letter is genuine, there are significant problems with this company that do not support the application and which give rise to concerns about the Applicant's", "bona fides"], ["[40]", "In the circumstances, I do not think there was an obligation to put the concerns over the genuineness of the letter to the Applicant because the real problem was that it is unusual for companies in Iraq to fund Canadian education and there was no supporting documentation to back up this commitment or to show it was genuine."], ["[41]", "As regards the Officer's reliance upon economic and security concerns in Iraq without putting these concerns to the Applicant, the Applicant says that the duty of fairness requires an officer to put concerns to an applicant whenever those concerns could not be reasonably anticipated by the applicant. I do not think that the jurisprudence of this Court supports this position. For example, in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 33, Justice Michel Shore had the following to say on point:", "As stated above, procedural protection that arises in the context of a student visa application is \"relaxed\". There is no unfairness if the Visa Officer did not communicate all of her concerns to Mr. Le Minh Duc Tran or that she did not accord him an opportunity to respond to those concerns. (Li, above;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )", "It is also reasonable to expect that Visa Officers will bring their own experience and expertise to the applications before them. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 1719 (QL), at para. 16;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 14)", "The fact that the Visa Officer considered the availability of similar culinary management programs of study available in Vietnam and South Asia at a \"fraction of the cost\" does not constitute an error. Contrary to what is argued by Mr. Le Minh Duc Tran, the Visa Officer did not rely on extrinsic evidence, but rather relied on her own expertise and analysis of all the evidence before her. (Wen, above, at paras. 18-19)", "As in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , these considerations of local conditions coupled with those considerations more personal to Mr. Le Minh Duc Tran, were part of the totality of circumstances which the Visa Officer had to assess in reaching her decision. (the Brown Affidavit;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 14)"], ["[42]", "So it seems to me that what applicants should expect is that the onus is upon them to make a convincing case and that, in assessing their applications, visa officers will use their general experience and knowledge of local conditions to draw inferences and reach conclusions on the basis of the information and documents provided by the applicant without necessarily putting any concerns that may arise to the applicant. The onus is upon the applicant to ensure that the application is comprehensive and contains all that is needed to make a convincing case."], ["[43]", "I can find no reviewable error with the Decision."], ["[44]", "Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[45]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "1.

Not all Canadians have the financial means or personal flexibility to make multiple trips out of Canada to visit the child to be adopted. Unless a contextual approach is taken to the means and abilities of the prospective parents to establish a genuine parent child relationship, adoptions will become the purview of Canadians of means, if they are not already."], ["[31]", "Although decided some 15 years ago, the Federal Court arrived at the same conclusion, although through different reasoning.

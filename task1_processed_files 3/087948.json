She suffered beatings and threats during some of these arrests."], ["[5]", "After the fourth incident, she decided to flee the country for fear of what would happen if she remained there.

The Board's reasons also invoke the Chairperson's Guidelines on Gender-Related Persecution."], ["[8]", "The Board laid out credibility concerns, beginning with the applicant's psychological evidence. She had consulted a psychologist in Turkey but had been unable to provide any documentary evidence. She produced a psychological report from a Toronto doctor, but the Board noted it was a single visit for the express purpose of obtaining a report for her refugee claim. The Board noted the report did not satisfactorily establish that the applicant's condition was the result of the facts alleged in her claim. The Board gave the report no weight since opinion evidence is only as valid as the truth of the facts on which it is based and the Board found the applicant lacked credibility."], ["[9]", "The Board found that on a balance of probabilities, she did not face the problems she alleged in Turkey and was not at a risk of harm at the hands of Turkish authorities. The reasons detail each credibility concern in turn."], ["[10]", "The applicant claimed that she and two of her cousins were detained in June 2007. In oral testimony, the applicant stated that one of the cousins lives in Ankara, but in her Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative, she said both lived in Istanbul. The Board rejected the applicant's explanation that the cousin went to Ankara, as it does not explain the inconsistency. The Board rejected the explanation that the applicant was referring to the cousin's mother's house being in Istanbul."], ["[11]", "The Board found that the applicant claimed at the hearing for the first time, that her cousin had been arrested due to the applicant's own activities. There was no mention in the PIF, including in amendments made at the start of the hearing. This allegation is a material part of her claim of persecution by the Turkish state."], ["[12]", "The Board gave little weight to two receipts showing membership in Alevi associations in Turkey based on the applicant's inconsistent answers to questions about who paid the dues and at what time. The Board also found that the handwritten letter from her cousin confirming the payment of dues contained no security features and the Board had no way of assessing its origins."], ["[13]", "The Board noted the inconsistency between the applicant's letter indicating she was a member of a cultural association's youth committee and her testimony indicating she was unaware of any committee."], ["[14]", "The Board questioned the authenticity of the letter dated December 26, 2012, from an Alevi association in Turkey.

While the applicant only learned of this allegation after submitting her PIF, it was not mentioned in the PIF amendments at the start of the hearing either."], ["[17]", "The Board outlined the applicant's conflicting testimony on her contact with her family in Turkey. She said she did not talk to her family on the phone and feared wiretapping, but later said she had spoken to them on the phone regarding obtaining a copy of the Turkish psychologist's report. She attempted to clarify this by saying she speaks to her family every few months, but this does not explain the discrepancy with the clear statement that she never speaks to them on the phone."], ["[18]", "The Board described conflicting oral testimony on whether the applicant went to a hospital after a beating during an arrest. She first said she did not go to a hospital, but then later said the Turkish authorities took her to a doctor. The Board consulted the audio recording and it indicated the applicant clearly said she did not go to a hospital."], ["[19]", "The Board found contradictions between the applicant's testimony and that of the supporting witness she offered. Her record of examination described him as a cousin, but her testimony described him as her father's friend.

The Board again emphasized the contradictory evidence regarding the applicant's membership in Alevi organizations, including questioning why she did not attend any activities of the pre-existing Alevi association in Toronto before taking part in founding a new association. The Board concluded there was no persuasive evidence that the practice of her faith in Canada would be problematic if she returned to Turkey."], ["[25]", "The Board noted the applicant did not speak the Kurdish language and led no evidence that all people from the area her grandparents came from were Kurdish.

The Board made negative credibility findings based on doubting the authenticity of three letters without ever raising this issue at the hearing and giving the applicant an opportunity to respond to this concern. The applicant argues there similarly was no notice of the Board's concerns over inconsistent arrest dates. This was a breach of the duty of fairness."], ["[30]", "The applicant disputes the Board's treatment of the evidence. The Board failed to presume the applicant's testimony was true, engaged in overzealous and microscopic examination, failed to explain its credibility findings in clear terms and made negative credibility findings based on the failure to offer documentation."], ["[31]", "The Board was required to analyze the applicant's explanations for the Board's concern and explain why it finds these explanations unreasonable. Board decisions of plausibility rather than other findings of fact are afforded less deference."], ["[32]", "The applicant provides rebuttal of several of the Board's credibility concerns. The arrest of the cousin was confirmed by a letter sent to the Board. The applicant only learned of the authorities seeking her after the PIF narrative was drafted. It was unreasonable to doubt the authenticity of the letter from her parents given it was hand written, signed and dated, and the Board did not indicate what other security features could be expected from a personal letter. Such documents are obtained for the specific purpose of overcoming credibility concerns. There was no conflicting testimony regarding the dues receipts as the association was simply unconcerned with the dues of an active member. The Board's questioning of the authenticity of the cousin's letter confirming the payment of dues also had no basis. The translated letter bore a translated letterhead, not the original. It was reasonable for a letter to mention only two of the four arrests and this is not a contradiction."], ["[33]", "The applicant argues the March 1999 date is not mentioned in neither the record of examination nor the PIF. The only reference is to March 1995, which is the date of the Gazi killings commemorated by the March 2008 event. All of the events mentioned in the PIF and testimony are in the record of examination, with the exception of the July 2009 date which the applicant explained should have been July 2008. The record of examination should only be used for exclusion and ineligibility and not for substantive issues and credibility, given applicants are not represented by counsel and these proceedings are not recorded."], ["[34]", "The applicant argues the inconsistency regarding the hospital is simply the difference between what she did after being released from the authorities and their treatment of her during custody, which included a visit to a doctor."], ["[35]", "The applicant argues the Board made a microscopic examination of her statements regarding where her cousin lives. The applicant explained in her culture, one refers to one's mother's home as one's home."], ["[36]", "The applicant disputes the Board's plausibility finding that a person who had problems with the Turkish authorities could leave the country legally. The Board cites documents that an individual will be stopped if she has been wanted or charged with a crime, but the applicant's arrests were illegal and extrajudicial. The Board cites no evidence for its conclusion that a victim of illegal detention would be unable to leave Turkey. The Board unreasonably rejected the applicant's explanation of the youth committee issue, that it was not a specific committee but only to distinguish the youth in the group."], ["[37]", "The Board's country conditions conclusions were based on the negative credibility findings above, that the applicant did not fit the profile of a politically active Kurd or Alevi who would be at risk. The Board overlooked country conditions evidence showing persecution of those participating in demonstrations."], ["[38]", "Finally, the applicant argues the Board erred by not undertaking a separate analysis under section 97 of the Act.

The problems with the letter from the Alevi association were obvious so did not need to be raised by the Board. The Board had a right to observe the basic reliability of the other letters without first apprising the applicant. The misstatement of the March 1999 date instead of March 1995 in the Board's reason is merely a clerical error."], ["[40]", "The respondent argues it was reasonable for the Board to fault the applicant for inconsistencies, even if there is evidence supporting her testimony; it does not resolve the inconsistencies.

La Commission ne renvoie à aucun élément de preuve à l'appui de sa conclusion selon laquelle une victime de détention illégale serait incapable de quitter la Turquie.

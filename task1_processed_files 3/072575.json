Among other things, the Agreement creates several decision-making and policy-making bodies involved in the administration of Nunavut. One of them, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (\"NWMB\"), is responsible for managing wildlife in the territory. The applicant argues that members of the NWMB are being underpaid, contrary requirement in the Agreement that they be provided \"fair and reasonable remuneration\". In particular, it submits that the refusal of the Privy Council Office (\"PCO\") to reclassify the NWMB, which would have resulted in an increase in its members' daily fees, amounts to a violation of the Agreement.

The Agreement itself, mentioned above, provides that members of the board should receive \"fair and reasonable remuneration\" for their work (Article 5.2.20). By way of a contract, the parties to the Agreement agreed in 1993 that the members should be paid $200 a day, and the Chairman $275 a day. Those rates were confirmed by orders in council in 1993 and 1994 respectively. The guidelines PCO administers for federal boards did not specifically mention the NWMB until they were revised in 2000.

It consulted with the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, which appoints and administers other northern boards and agencies. In the end, PCO staff concluded that the NWMB should remain a category IV agency. The Deputy Clerk of the Privy Council, Mr. Ronald Bilodeau, agreed with that conclusion. As a result, PCO took no action to alter the existing rates of pay. In April 2002, Mr. Kovic was so informed.

However, PCO ultimately made its decision not to reclassify the board, at least in part, based on other factors, including what it called the principle of \"internal relativity\". \"Internal relativity\" simply means that PCO compared the NWMB with other bodies and attempted to ensure that like organizations were treated similarly.

Under the revised guidelines released in 2000, the NWMB is listed as a Category IV Board. When PCO increased daily fees in 2001, NWMB members were given $225 a day (and the Chairman $325), which was at the mid-point of the Category IV range. If they had been paid according to the Category III scale, they would have received about $275 and $400 respectively."], ["[30]", "When PCO responded to NWMB's request for increased remuneration, it stated that the board was \"appropriately classified as Category IV Board\".

The placement of a board in a particular category does not necessarily dictate the remuneration of its members. The guidelines themselves specify that the daily rates set out in it are maximums. Board members may be paid less than, and in special circumstances, more than, the fee range corresponding to the board's designated category. Accordingly, even if PCO had made a mistake about which category the NWMB had fallen within originally, it was entitled to find that its members' remuneration should now fall within Category IV.

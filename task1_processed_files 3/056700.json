When the cease-fire broke down, he claims that he was unable to return to his home."], ["[9]", "The Applicant helped in his uncle's store for approximately one year, at which time he obtained a job with an entity called Road Construction Private Company Ltd [Company]. It is common ground between the parties that the operations of the Company were controlled by the LTTE during the period of the Applicant's employment, namely, approximately July 2007 to August 2008. It is also common ground that the Applicant obtained that job through a person named Sinnappa Master, an acquaintance of his aunt, to avoid front-line service with the LTTE.

The key issue was therefore whether the Applicant was a \"member\" of that organization."], ["[13]", "The ID found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Company was controlled by the LTTE at the relevant time. However, it rejected the suggestion that the mere fact of working for an LTTE-controlled company is sufficient to constitute membership in the LTTE, for the purposes of paragraph 34(1)(f) of the IRPA.

The meaning of the term \"member\" in paragraph 34(1)(f) is a question of statutory interpretation that is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.

In my view, to the extent that the test for the defence of duress has been settled in the jurisprudence (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), it is not open to the IAD to apply a different test. Accordingly, the issue of whether the IAD applied the proper test for the defence of duress is reviewable on a standard of correctness (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).

The Applicant also asserts that the IAD erred by failing to reasonably consider and balance factors that it was required to assess. I agree that the IAD appears to have committed both of these errors. In any event, it is clear that it committed the latter one."], ["[27]", "It is settled law that the term \"member,\" as it is used in section 34 of the IRPA, must be given a broad meaning ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 27-29; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 33;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ])."], ["[28]", "The jurisprudence has not yet established a precise and exhaustive definition of the term \"member\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above;", "Toronto Coalition", ", above, at para 118; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 37). However, it is clear that actual or formal membership in the organization in question is not required; informal participation or support for a group may suffice ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 33-34;", "Sepid", ", above, at para 17), depending on the nature of that participation or support."], ["[29]", "In determining whether a foreign national is a member of an organization described in paragraph 34(1)(f), some assessment of that person's participation in the organization in question must be undertaken (", "Toronto Coalition", ", above, at para 118; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 24). In this regard, three criteria that should be considered include the nature of the person's involvement in the organization, the length of time involved, and the degree of the person's commitment to the organization's goals and objectives (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [", "TK", "];", "Toronto Coalition", ", above, at para 130; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 18;", "Sepid", ", above, at para 14; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 44-45).

In general, the evidence must establish \"more than mere suspicion, but less than [what is required by] the standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the balance of probabilities\" (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 114 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).

Accordingly, the only question addressed by the IAD was whether the Applicant was an informal \"member\" of the LTTE."], ["[32]", "In its decision, the IAD noted that the Applicant provided inconsistent evidence regarding whether the Company was controlled by the LTTE. In his letter to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], the Applicant unambiguously stated that he worked for the LTTE (Applicant's Record, p 52). The IAD acknowledged that the contents of that letter were based on advice that he received about what to say. Nevertheless, the IAD found that this evidence was consistent with the Applicant's responses to several questions posed during his initial interview with the Canada Border Services Agency [CBSA] on August 29, 2010, when he characterized his employment as having been for \"an administration section [of the LTTE] who were involved in the road construction\" (Applicant's Record, p 63). In reaching this finding, the IAD acknowledged that the information provided by the Applicant during that interview was not entirely clear in places. However, it found that there was no material lack of clarity upon reading the Applicant's responses as a whole."], ["[33]", "The IAD proceeded to determine that this evidence was more reliable than the testimony given by the Applicant during proceedings before the ID and the IAD, when he took the position that the Company was controlled by the government. In this regard, the IAD stated that it was more likely than not that the allegation of inadmissibility to Canada based on the Applicant's association and employment with the LTTE had influenced his later testimony. In any event, the IAD found that the available evidence regarding the LTTE's control of the region in which the Applicant lived and worked substantially excluded the possibility that the Company was controlled by the government and that the government would have deducted funds from employees' salaries for the LTTE, as the Applicant alleged."], ["[34]", "In my view, these findings were not unreasonable. They were well \"within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law,\" and were appropriately transparent, intelligible and justified ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above", "at para 47). As an aside, I note that the ID also concluded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Company was controlled by the LTTE. In addition, during the hearing of this Application, and solely for the purposes of this Application, the Applicant conceded that the Company was controlled by the LTTE."], ["[35]", "However, to the extent that the IAD appears to have concluded, that the Applicant was an informal member of the LTTE, largely based on the mere fact that he worked for the LTTE to avoid serving on the front lines of battle, it erred."], ["[36]", "At paragraph 17 of its decision, the IAD stated: \"I agree with the [Respondent] that, if the [Company] was an LTTE operation and the employment was effectively in lieu of the [Applicant] engaging in the front lines of battle, the employment amounts to informal membership in the LTTE.\" Later in its decision, at paragraph 19, the IAD gave the following reasons for concluding that the Applicant was an informal member of the LTTE:", "i. The Applicant obtained his employment in the Company through a prominent member of the LTTE (Mr. Master);", "ii. He was paid by the LTTE and left that employment together with other employees of the Company when the Sri Lankan army advanced into the region;", "iii. He told the CBSA shortly after arriving in Canada that the Company was an LTTE organization and that he worked there in lieu of having to serve on the front lines of battle;", "iv. In his letter to the UNHCR, he identified the Company as an LTTE institution and stated that he worked there instead of engaging at the front lines."], ["[37]", "The foregoing reasons, taken alone, did not provide a sufficient basis upon which to reasonably conclude that the Applicant was a member of the LTTE.

It did this in the context of explaining the basis for its conclusion that the Applicant's statements to the UNHCR and the CBSA were more reliable than his testimony to the ID and the IAD concerning the issue of whether the Company was controlled by the LTTE or the government. In this regard, the IAD noted the following:", "i. He was hired by Mr. Master to work for the Company in 2007, \"when recruitment was forced,\" as a caretaker of a house for engineers and other officer grade people in the Company; and", "ii. He was able to give part of his salary of 6,000 rupees per month to the LTTE to avoid having to dig bunkers for the LTTE - that money was used by the LTTE to hire someone else to perform that task."], ["[39]", "After noting the foregoing facts, together with the reasons why it found the Applicant's statements to the UNHCR and the CBSA to be more reliable than his statements to the ID and the IAD on the issue of whether the Company was controlled by the LTTE or the government, the IAD again stated its conclusions that (i) the Company was an LTTE organization, and (ii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Applicant's employment in that Company amounts to informal membership in the LTTE."], ["[40]", "I have serious doubts that these additional reasons given by the IAD met the legal requirement to consider the issues of the nature of the Applicant's involvement in the Company and the degree of his commitment to the LTTE's goals and objectives. However, even if it could be said that those reasons met that requirement, the IAD still failed to reasonably engage with those factors and to weigh them against the factors that supported its conclusion that the Applicant was a member of the LTTE."], ["[41]", "Some evidence bearing on those factors (the nature of the Applicant's involvement in the Company and the degree of his commitment to the LTTE's goals and objectives) was assessed in the earlier decision by the ID (at paragraph 47), when the ID concluded that the Applicant was not a member of the LTTE. In this regard, the ID noted the following:", "i. The Applicant worked for the Company not to further the terrorist objectives of the LTTE, but to avoid forced recruitment.", "ii. The work he did was not clearly supportive of the LTTE's terrorist objectives.", "iii. There is no evidence that he had any involvement with the LTTE after his job with them ended.", "iv. He did not refer to himself as a member or express a desire to become a member of the LTTE."], ["[42]", "The Applicant provided important evidence on these points that should have been meaningfully addressed by the IAD.

When he was finally forced to encounter those recruiters, he was able to successfully resist them approximately five or six times by telling them that he was the only relative who could help his uncle at the store (CTR, at pp 1212, 1238);", "iii. He was scared to join the LTTE and he did not want to fight for them (CTR, at p 1274);", "iv.

He gave up part of his salary to avoid digging bunkers, because he was scared and \"didn't want to go and get killed by helping the Liberation Tigers. I didn't need to do that for them\" (CTR, at pp 1274, 1254, 1212); and", "vi. He did not support or even wish to help the LTTE, and he perceived that the LTTE had not done anything to benefit the people (CTR, pp 90, 108, 205)."], ["[43]", "This evidence suggested that the Applicant was not committed to the LTTE's goals and objectives. The IAD erred by failing to meaningfully engage with it."], ["[44]", "The same is true with respect to the nature of the Applicant's role and participation within the Company. Although the IAD recognized that he was employed as a caretaker, it did not appear to give any weight to the fact that this was obviously a minimal or marginal role within the organization ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 37)."], ["[45]", "Contrary to the Respondent's submissions, these errors did not simply involve the weight given to the evidence by the IAD.

In addition, it accepted the documentary evidence that reported on the LTTE's heightened campaign of forced conscription and the pressure it brought to bear on households to provide young men and women for its operations or to work in entities that were under its control."], ["[50]", "In this context, people within that region who could not find a way to work in a family or other business that was not controlled by the LTTE may have had little realistic alternative but to either join the LTTE or work for an entity that it controlled, particularly if they needed to work to support themselves or their families. It is not reasonable to suggest, as the Respondent did in its submissions to the IAD (CTR, at p 1284), that simply being employed by an LTTE-controlled entity in such a context was sufficient to render a person a \"member\" of the LTTE for the purposes of section 34 of the IRPA. A more nuanced analysis that addressed the factors that have been identified in the jurisprudence discussed at paragraph 29 above was required."], ["[51]", "The Respondent appears to suggest that, when the IAD's decision is read as a whole, it becomes apparent that the IAD met the legal requirement to engage with the issues of the nature of the Applicant's involvement in the Company and the degree of his commitment to the LTTE's goals and objectives. However, even if the IAD is given the benefit of the significant doubt that I have on this issue, the IAD still failed to meaningfully address factors that it was required to consider, including by weighing those factors against the factors that mitigated in favour of its conclusion that the Applicant was a member of the LTTE."], ["[52]", "Accordingly, the IAD's decision will be set aside and remitted to a differently constituted panel for redetermination in accordance with these reasons."], ["[53]", "The parties declined to propose a question for certification and I agree that no serious question of general importance arises on the facts of this case.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[54]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "1.

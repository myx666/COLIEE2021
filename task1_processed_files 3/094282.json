Indeed, the rate of acceptance had begun (albeit not markedly so) to decline even before the Minister's comments. Without expert guidance, it would be difficult to draw conclusions from such evidence unless the statistics were overwhelming conclusive on their face or unless the statistics were clearly supported by other reliable evidence.

Moreover, the acceptance of such a discretion in cases of this kind would act as a spur to the parties to try to present the court with as much evidence on the merits as they could. Not only would this increase the costs of judicial review but it also entails the arrogation to itself by the court of a function that properly belongs to the decision maker whose procedure have been brought into question.

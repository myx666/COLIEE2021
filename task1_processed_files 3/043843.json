Such limitation is not a factor in the present timely Federal Court litigation."], ["[24]", "Most usually, perhaps even universally, a defendant seeking a stay on the grounds of a jurisdiction clause will go out of its way to show that it seeks no procedural advantage by specifically waiving any time-bar. This is an excellent way of showing good faith. However, in the present instance, Hyundai says and here I quote from counsel's brief:", "\"if the plaintiff is faced with a time-bar in Korea then the plaintiff's prejudice is self-induced and the omission to protect time in the contractual forum should not prevent a stay of this action.\"", "Pertinent here is", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "(supra). There Mr. Justice Colman pointed out that a stay will not be ordered, even where the plaintiff has decided not to preserve time in a foreign jurisdiction, so long as there is a strong case for the jurisdiction where the action has in fact been commenced. Indeed, even where there is not a strong case to maintain jurisdiction, except for the time bar, a stay will not be granted if a plaintiff can show it acted reasonable. Whether failure to start a protective action in a foreign jurisdiction is unreasonable depends upon the circumstances: see", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. In the present instance, in addition to the time bar argument, the plaintiff has a strong case by which to oppose a stay. Moreover, it acted reasonably in not commencing a backup action in Korea for it is not unfair to say that the plaintiff was lulled into believing Hyundai would or had attorned to the Federal Court jurisdiction. Hyundai's argument, set out above, that the plaintiff had brought its time bar problem upon itself is an argument that will not wash. The time bar and resulting prejudice is a very strong and here a sufficient ground for refusing a stay. Yet there are other factors which either go toward refusing a stay or are a strong ground for denying a stay.", "Differences In The Law"], ["[25]", "In applying", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "I should look at the mechanics of enforcing a claim in the courts in Korea. Korean procedure is based on civil law. Hyundai's expert says there will be 7 to 10 court hearings to submit evidence over the one or two year course of the action. Apparently there is no formal discovery of documents. Rather there is an ad hoc production of documents if a party can convince the Korean court, in each instance, as to the relevance of a document. Nor is there a means to compel oral testimony unless, in the same way, a party can convince the Korean court that a witness ought to be compelled to testify. This sort of thing is particularly relevant in a cargo claim, which depends generally upon documentation and particularly upon the evidence of and documents produced by loading surveyors, tally clerks, the officer in charge of loading, the master during carriage, ship's officers during discharge and discharge surveyors. The differences in Korean law, as compared with Canadian law, are a substantial point against allowing a stay.", "In Rem Proceedings"], ["[26]", "The present action is in rem and in personam. Hyundai's Korean law expert says that there is no in rem procedure in the Korean courts, but then goes on to set out that vessels may be arrested. It is clear from the expert's material that such an arrest is to force a sale to satisfy a mortgage or a maritime lien, neither of which applies in the present instance. Alternately, there is a prejudgment attachment procedure analogous to a Mareva injunction, to preserve assets, with the party requiring preservation to put up a bond, which is forfeited if the claimant is not successful. Such prejudgments attachments are subject to prior security and to challenges by the shipowner for a preliminary injunction cancelling such an arrest. This arrest procedure is also interesting in that not only must the ship be within the Korean jurisdiction, when the order is sought from the court, but also such an arrest order takes a minimum of one or two days and will not be effective if a ship has completed preparation for a voyage. In the present instance there is no in rem security which might be carried over. It is thus a factor, although in the present instance certainly not a strong factor, that in rem security in Korea, based on an arrest or the threat of an arrest, might seem to be something of an illusion, particularly when paired with the reasonable availability of arrest in Canada. All of this might prejudice a plaintiff and could conceivably prejudice the plaintiff, however I give it very little weight in this instance.", "Intransigence And Attornment"], ["[27]", "There is further strong reason to deny a stay and that is the intransigence on the part of Hyundai in seeking the stay. Coupled with this factor are the initial actions of Hyundai, which are tantamount to attornment or estoppel. A similar estoppel arose in", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "(supra), considered at page 598 and following. There the estoppel was in the form of a letter of undertaking. Here the estoppel is no less binding because it was the result of telephone calls and correspondence by which Hyundai sought time extensions within which to file its defence and then, after much delay, changed its position to the detriment of the plaintiff which had conducted its case in a normal manner in the Federal Court because it had been lead to believe that jurisdiction would not be an issue."], ["[28]", "These factors, intransigence and attornment or estoppel, are bound together in the present instance. They also go toward prejudice to the plaintiff. To begin, Hyundai indicated it wished a time extension so it might file a defence. This request was made on 10 July 1997, well before the time-bar had run. Had Hyundai, at that time, indicated it would challenge jurisdiction on the basis of some exceedingly fine print on the reverse of the Bill of Lading, the plaintiff could easily have preserved time by commencing proceedings in Korea. Counsel for the plaintiff makes a fair and proper statement: he says he is not prepared to undertake that he would have commenced an action in Korea had he learned, at the last minute but within time, of Hyundai's intention to challenge jurisdiction. Yet, what counsel, the plaintiff, or the plaintiff's underwriters might have done is pure hypothetical conjecture for, on the basis of dealings with Hyundai, counsel felt there was no need to bring an action in Korea as the claim, for some $87,000, was properly secured by an action in Canada, Hyundai wished to file a defence and jurisdiction was not an issue. This sort of situation arose in", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. However, on the facts in that instance, the plaintiff had not been mislead or lulled by the conduct of the defendant's advisors. That is not the fact pattern in the present instance. In itself Hyundai's request for and grant of a time extension within which to file a defence constitutes an estoppel. The plaintiff was further lulled by the 24 July 1998 letter from Hyundai's counsel, quoted in part earlier, setting out an intent to apply, some five weeks in the future, on behalf of Hyundai, for an extension of time within which to file a defence. This estoppel is, in itself, a strong cause by which to deny a stay.", "Delay In Seeking A Stay"], ["[29]", "There is also the matter of delay. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. In", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "the statement of claim was filed 30 March 1982, with the defendant advising, 7 April, that it would apply for a stay. This is the sort of prompt unequivocal action that is required and this is particularly so in the Federal Court."], ["[30]", "The rules of this court have always been time sensitive. This is particularly the case since the institution of the new rules in April of 1998. A plaintiff has always had the onus of moving an action along in a timely manner.

Yet, under the new rules, plaintiff's counsel and a plaintiff who does not move an action along at the required rate may suffer more than embarrassment to counsel and convenience to plaintiff. If either pleadings are not closed within 180 days from the issuance of a statement of claim, or all procedural steps completed and a pretrial conference not requested within 360 days of issuance of a statement of claim, the court may and indeed the court, by reason of delay, has struck out a proceeding by way of status review under rules 380 and 381. This is prejudice which cannot be compensated for in costs."], ["[31]", "In the present instance the actions of the plaintiff and of plaintiff's counsel have clearly shown not only reasonable accommodation to Hyundai and various of Hyundai's counsel, but also a proper desire and indeed steps taken, to get on with the action. Here I have in mind ongoing production of documents, yet accommodation to allow Hyundai time to file a defence, a proper balance which would permit the action to proceed in a timely way. In contrast, Hyundai has not lived up to the obligation to bring on its objections to jurisdiction quickly and at an early stage. This is also a strong reason by which to deny the present stay.", "Conclusion"], ["[32]", "As I indicated in", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "(supra) at p. 603, a stay is decided not by adding up points, pro and con, but by considering factors involving the appropriateness and convenience of a given forum and factors going to secure proper justice.

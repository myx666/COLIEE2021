As a trier of fact, the RPD assesses the witnesses, and views the evidence first-hand in respect of an Applicant's credibility, in light of the evidence as a whole. In consideration of the recent jurisprudence, it is the Court's view that the RAD owes varying degrees of deference to a RPD's decision, depending on whether the RAD is hearing an appeal on issues of credibility or otherwise.

Ceci dit avec égards, j'ai toujours cette crainte au sujet de la confusion des genres. Il me semblerait préférable de s'en tenir à la norme d'erreur manifeste et dominante en appel sur les questions de fait. Il n'y a rien de nouveau à la proposition qu'une instance d'appel fait preuve de retenue lorsque l'organisme dont la décision est en appel procède d'une discrétion importante comme l'examen de la crédibilité.

Phelan supports the view that deference may be owed by the RAD in respect of a RPD's findings on credibility which are critical or determinative to the outcome of the RPD's decision.

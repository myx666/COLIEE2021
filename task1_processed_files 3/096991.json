Prior to the leave stage, the applications could have been rejected as flawed in form, thus requiring the decisions to be addressed independently and perhaps in a single application for leave. Even in their presented form, the applications could have been rejected at the leave stage without being determined. Nevertheless, they were not rejected at either stage, and they entered the decision-making process in flawed form. In my opinion the procedure adopted by the family was ill advised, because, as detailed below, it has worked a grave injustice to each member of the family other than the Applicant."], ["[4]", "The procedure is ill advised because the negative PRRA decision and the negative H&C decision were decided by the same Visa Officer and each decision is directed to all members of the family jointly. Consequently, if either the PRRA decision or the H&C decision is set aside for reviewable error, each member of the family is entitled to a redetermination on the evidence as it exists on the date of the redetermination. With respect to the Applicant's Application challenging the two decisions, leave was granted, whereas, leave was not granted on the applications of the other members of the family. Since reasons for granting leave are not provided it is not possible to determine in which decision the arguable error was perceived."], ["[5]", "The injustice lies in the fact that the family's applications were not considered as a unit. As set out below, I find no reviewable error in the PRRA decision, but I find that the H&C decision is fundamentally flawed. Therefore, while the Applicant is entitled to a redetermination on the H&C decision, the other members of his family are not, even though the decision does not differentiate their pleas for humanitarian and compassionate relief. In my opinion this is unjust. The decisions under review did not make a distinction on the merits of the arguments tendered by the family, and, indeed, leave should have been determined in the same way; for an error warranting leave in either decision, all applications should have been granted leave."], ["[6]", "With respect to the PRRA decision presently under review, I find that the Applicant's challenge fails."], ["[7]", "At the Refugee Protection Division level, the joint protection claim of each member of the family was dismissed on the finding that state protection would be available to them on their return to Kenya.

I find no reviewable error in this determination. From the material filed by the Applicant in the present Application, and from what he submitted in argument as an unrepresented litigant during the course of the hearing of the Application, it is clear that the Applicant's present concern is that new evidence exists regarding risk to him in Kenya which post-dates the PRRA decision.

As I expressed during the course of the hearing of the present Application, a critical error of fact is, on its own, enough to find that the decision is made in reviewable error. The critical error of fact is the statement that the parents have \"three children who continue to reside in Kenya\". In fact, at the date of the decision, the \"children\" were 27, 23, and 20 years of age and the eldest was resident in Dallas, Texas (H&C Tribunal Record, p. 101).

This is true because the possible repercussions of the return of an applicant to his or her country of origin are an important factor in giving both risk and humanitarian and compassionate relief from the return. At the practical level, a visa officer is required to have a full knowledge of all the evidence tendered on both issues, and factual findings across both applications must be based on knowledge of the complete record."], ["[13]", "The", "Risk / Hardship Allegations", "section makes a critically important statement about the suffering that the Applicant's sister experienced in Kenya. Clarity is brought to this statement by the following description provided by the Applicant's father:", "At the same time, my daughter Naomi was also facing turmoil during our absence. She was kidnapped, raped and left for dead, by unknown masked man. The good Samaritans took her to police and then to hospital. This man warned her that this was a lesson taught to my family, and as a result she became pregnant from the raping. She went through many difficulties during her pregnancy as she was again attacked at gunpoint at the chemist when the pregnancy was seven months, and almost miscarriaged and was taken to hospital which saved her life.", "(PIF of William Sosi Machungo, PRRA Tribunal Record, p.16)", "In my opinion, if the Applicant's sister's experience is found to be a consideration in reaching a determination, as it was here, it was incumbent on the Visa Officer to reach a conclusion about the weight to be placed on the consideration. This was not done."], ["[14]", "The", "Risk / Hardship Analysis", "is internally inconsistent. The Applicants statements of risk upon return to Kenya are contained in the RPD decision, and, in addition, the Applicants supplied a wealth of material to the Visa Officer on risk arising from in-country conditions in Kenya. In arriving at the PRRA decision, the Visa Officer was required to read this evidence. Therefore, the statement that \"the applicants do not appear to have provided any documents as evidence in support of their risk of returning to Kenya\" while at the same time saying that \"I am of the opinion that the risks described by the applicants would not be sufficient as to constitute a hardship if they were to return to Kenya\" does not make sense unless it is understood that the Visa Officer failed in two respects."], ["[15]", "First, at the opening to the decision this statement is made:", "Items given consideration include:", "• IP-5, Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds", "• Applications for permanent residence & supporting documentation", "• RPD decision dated 24 February 2006 TA4-1967/72/73 & TA5-04488", "• U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, 2006", "http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78740.htm", "• Amnesty International Report 2007, http://thereport.amnesty.org", "• Federal Court decision:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  obvious that, in reaching the decision on the H&C application the Visa Officer did not consider the entirety of the evidence the applicants supplied on the issue of risk. While some of this evidence is contained in the material filed on the PRRA application, I do not think it can be reasonably argued that they should be required to present the same material on each discrete application when they are inextricably linked. Indeed, since the Visa Officer was charged with rendering both decisions, this is absolutely unnecessary. In this kind of situation, surely some accommodation should be made to not let the form interfere with the substance. It is important to note that the Visa Officer did view the PRRA and H&C applications as inextricably linked, because the analysis of risk in the H&C decision is taken directly from the body of the PRRA decision."], ["[16]", "Second, the evidence of the experience of suffering the applicants experienced as recounted in the RPD decision is not refuted; indeed, as stated, the RPD made no negative credibility finding with respect to it. Therefore, the experience existed, and the question is: to be humanitarian and compassionate, should the applicants be returned to face this same risk? The existence of state protection is not the central issue in a humanitarian and compassionate deliberation. The issue is whether the applicants should be sent possibly, or probably, to relive the experiences which caused them to flee. While they did not succeed in their claim for protection under s.96 and s.97 of the", "IRPA", ", they are entitled to an H&C assessment with the past experiences clearly in mind.

The Visa Officer makes the statement that \"there has been no information provided by the applicants with regard to the situation in Kenya with respect to these children or why they did not accompany their parents to Canada\" to ground the pivotal assumption that \"these children have established themselves in Kenya and were reluctant, or viewed it unnecessary to come to Canada\". The assumption is sheer speculation. It is clear that the speculation formed a central part of the negative decision rendered. Indeed, there is evidence on the record which refutes the speculative opinion and which, by the exclusive evidentiary analysis undertaken, was apparently not known or neglected. In his PIF, the father says about the children in Kenya:", "I am still crying for my other two kids back home who I was unable to rescue because they were in boarding high schools (that served as their refugee/hiding places) and had not attained certificates to allow them to get admission and student visas to escape out of the country.", "(PIF of William Sosi Machungo, PRRA Tribunal Record, pp. 16-17)"], ["[18]", "In my opinion, the use of the conclusion that the applicants are well established in Canada is perverse because it takes the existence of a factor set out in IP 5 as a consideration militating towards granting humanitarian and compassionate relief and uses it to do just the opposite. Obviously, the proven establishment of the applicants in Canada should work in their favour because there is absolutely no way of knowing whether the personal abilities they used to create this establishment can be used in Kenya to accomplish the same thing. To speculate that the applicants would be successful is a primary error, given the evidence of suffering they experienced in Kenya before fleeing to Canada."], ["[19]", "A final factor considered in the establishment section requires comment.

The point made is intended to apply to the applicants. In my opinion, given the circumstances that the applicants present, this is an unfair standard to apply to them. For example, the following is the mother's plea to be allowed to stay on humanitarian and compassionate grounds:", "Having applied for refugee status and was refused, I will not be permitted to travel outside the country to apply for permanent residence visa for Canada and be allowed re-entry. So I am extremely fearful of going out of Canada as required by the law and Canada is the only country I can submit my application from within. I am extremely fearful to what will happen to me if returned to my country. I will only become a destitute having no home to go after loosing all I possessed on earth. My home was burnt, land grabed [sic] and family business burnt to ashes by my enemies in my own country, who wanted to kill me and my family. I became a refugee in my own country. My relatives contributed greatly to my sufferings by excommunicating me from the community after refusing my daughters not to go through FGM and thus they cannot provide or assist me and my family. Canada is the only country I have come to know that has a good record and respect on Human Rights. Canada has provided homage and protection to myself and my family. Emotionally and socially I am oriented and attached to Canadians who have become my brethren in all aspects of life. Economically I am stable and if returned back home, there is none, not one person who will provide for me and my husband in terms of daily living, after being on the run for many years and especially the last past 4 (four) years.", "Therefore it is my sincere plea to be given a chance to submit my application from within.", "(Supplementary Information of Christne Moraa, H&C Tribunal Record, p. 99)", "By virtue of this statement, not only is the mental state of the daughter in issue because of the sexual assault she suffered, but the mental state of the mother is in issue as well.

That is, it is not only fair for the members of the family to be granted reconsideration, but it is consistent with the manner in which the family's H&C application was conducted; they applied as a family, the decision was rendered in respect to them as a family, and the reconsideration should be granted to them as a family."], ["[22]", "I request the Minister to give the Applicant's father, mother, and sister careful and expeditious consideration if they choose to file another humanitarian and compassionate relief application.", "ORDER"], ["[23]", "Accordingly, I set aside the H&C decision under review, and refer the matter back to a different visa officer for redetermination."], ["[24]", "There is no question to certify.", "[End of document]"]]}

It was also reasonable for the RPD to give less weight to certain parts of the subjective evidence, and more to the objective documents in evidence, such as documents produced by the government, the media, or personal documents created for a purpose other than for obtaining refugee protection. Furthermore, it was reasonable for the RPD to reject the claim that BNP support alone put the Applicants at risk of being killed, based on the evaluation of documentary evidence that was done by the RPD.

The credibility of the Applicants with regard to their allegations of threats and attacks in Bangladesh was undermined because the Applicants did not make a refugee claim in the United States and waited two months in the United States before making a refugee claim in Canada. Before the RPD, the Principal Applicant testified that his intention was to make a refugee claim in the United States and that the Bangladesh community, to whom he spoke in the United States, advised him that it would take longer to do so in the United States, than it would in Canada, to obtain refugee status.

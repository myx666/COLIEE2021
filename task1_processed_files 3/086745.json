He and his family (together, the applicants) - his common-law spouse, Helena Samkova (born October 10, 1983), his son, Josef Bledy Jr. (born June 10, 2002), his daughter, Jenifer Bledy (born February 3, 2004), and his son, Adam Frantisek Bledy (born September 24, 2008) - arrived in Canada on December 17, 2009 and claimed refugee protection on December 19, 2009.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "The applicants claimed protection as convention refugees, alleging a well-founded fear of persecution in the Czech Republic based on their Roma ethnicity. Failing a successful claim under section 96 of the IRPA, the applicants also claimed protection under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, based on their fear of being victims of further violence in the Czech Republic, as well as based on their assertion that they, as Romani citizens, would receive inadequate healthcare if returned to the Czech Republic.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "In the principal applicant's Personal Information Form (PIF), he alleged the following facts in support of his family's claim:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(a) In kindergarten, the principal applicant had been verbally harassed for being a Roma child. He defended himself physically and was expelled.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(b) Both the principal applicant and his spouse received their education via \"special\" schools for children with mental disabilities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(c) The Czech students at the regular school would swear, demean and attack both the principal applicant and his spouse because they were Roma. They complained to the teachers and director, but no action was taken.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(d) As a child, the principal applicant was prevented from participating in sports (hockey, soccer, karate) organized by his home municipality, because he attended a \"special\" school.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(e) Josef Jr. was also placed in a \"special\" school despite his parents' attempts to register him in a regular school and despite the fact that his parents believed he had performed well on his entrance exams.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(f) The principal applicant was prevented from participating in a bricklayer apprenticeship due to insufficient education. Although he had been registered at the employment office since he was 15 years old, he had received only limited employment because of his poor schooling and his ethnicity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(g) In August of 2005, while in Pisek to visit his aunt, the principal applicant and his cousin were attacked by 12 skinheads who yelled various racial slurs. They were kicked until the cousin had a concussion. The aunt called the police, but the police laughed at them and accused them of provoking the attack.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(h) In January of 2006, while at a disco in Protivin, the principal applicant and two cousins were attacked by a group of 30-40 skinheads. One cousin was stabbed, while the principal applicant and the other cousin had concussions and were bleeding. The other patrons at the disco did nothing to intervene. The police were called, but they accused the boys of provoking the skinheads. The police did not write up a report.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(i) In August of 2007, the principal applicant's mother-in-law was raped and beaten by a man who swore at her using various racial slurs. She was left in the woods unconscious. The police laughed at her and suggested she made it up or that it was her fault. Despite having evidence (a description of the car and semen samples), and despite the applicants checking with the police on multiple occasions, the police never found the assailant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(j) In December of 2007, the applicants were visiting their parents in Vimperk for Christmas. On Christmas day, their house was set on fire, but it was saved by firefighters. The next day, the basement was set on fire, it was again extinguished. On December 28th, the roof was set on fire and on the 29th, the whole roof burned down along with part of the house. Although the applicants did not see the attackers, they heard on the news that it was a \"racist attack\". The applicants' parents were given alternate temporary accommodations by the city. However, those alternate accommodations had no water, toilet, or bathroom.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(k) In November of 2008, the principal applicant, his spouse and her four cousins, were attacked by 6 skinheads with baseball bats while at a local pub celebrating the christening of Adam. Before fleeing the scene, the skinheads let off 5 pistol rounds as a warning. The police called an ambulance and left in pursuit of the attackers. Although the police took statements from the principal applicant and his family, the applicants never heard anything further about the investigation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "At the hearing before the Board, the principal applicant added the following additional allegations in support of his family's claim:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(a) In 1992, when he was a young boy, his cousin was attacked and killed by skinheads. Counsel for the applicants provided the Board with a video recording of a news report regarding the incident.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(b) The principal applicant's eldest son was attacked on his first day of school by a group of 6 Czech boys. His son came home with a black eye, but the teacher said that his son had started the fight.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(c) The principal applicant's brother-in-law, Stefan, was attacked in the Czech Republic only three days after being returned home from Canada following a denied refugee claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(d) There are skinheads among the Czech police. On one occasion, a police officer approached the principal applicant in the park and asked, \"What are you black mug doing here? <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Impugned Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The Board began its reasons by noting that it had \"some credibility concerns.\" First, it indicated that the principal applicant testified that he had suffered a concussion as a result of the attack in Pisek and that he had spent some time in hospital, whereas, in his PIF he did not mention that he was in hospital. The Board found this to be an embellishment and that the applicant was, in fact, never in hospital as a result of any skinhead attacks. Second, the Board concluded that \"some of the details surrounding the rape are inaccurate\" and therefore gave \"little weight to the statement that the rape occurred because the second claimant's mother was of Roma ethnicity\". This finding was due to a discrepancy between the principal applicant's PIF and his testimony with regards to the number of attackers involved.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The Board then went on to discuss \"discrimination vs. persecution\". It acknowledged that Romani children in the Czech Republic are still \"systematically turned away from regular schools\" and sent to remedial schools that cater to developmental disabilities. It further acknowledged that these remedial schools provide substandard levels of education that do \"not meet the minimum requirements for dignity. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "It then referred to a report from the Roma Education Fund which indicated there had been improvements in recent years: preparatory classes for children from difficult backgrounds, additional teachers' assistants to work in schools that had a high proportion of Roma, free pre-school education, secondary school scholarships for Roma students, abolition of special-education schools, and increased government funding. The Board also referred to a government program entitled, \"Reintegration of Roma Pupils\", the objective of which was to correct cases where Romani students were wrongfully placed in remedial schools. It also pointed to a decision of the European Court of Human Rights [ECHR] which determined that the Czech Republic had indirectly discriminated against certain students by placing them in remedial schools. The verdict obliged the Czech Republic to enact legislation prohibiting discrimination against Romani children in the education system.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "The Board acknowledged that the treatment of the applicants, in placing them in remedial schooling, was \"obviously a form of discrimination along with the verbal insults and the physical assaults.\" However, it found that since steps were being taken to deal with this discrimination, and since the ECHR decision meant that the applicants would have a remedy with regards to their eldest son's placement, the Board concluded that the situation with respect to education did not rise to the level of persecution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "Turning to the principal applicant's difficulty in finding employment, the Board acknowledged that there may have been some discrimination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "With respect to the allegation that the police had discriminated against the principal applicant by calling him names, the Board noted that this had only occurred once.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "The Board then considered two of the alleged assaults. Regarding the alleged attack in Pisek in 2005, the Board reiterated that it had \"some concerns about the embellishment of the details\" surrounding that incident. Regarding the alleged fires during Christmas of 2007, the Board concluded that there was no persuasive evidence that the fires were set because the inhabitants were Roma.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "The Board then indicated that the word \"persecution\" had been ascribed the meaning of \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\" The Board indicated that the physical attacks on the applicants would be canvassed in the subsequent section on state protection and that; ultimately, there was no persuasive evidence of a sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "It concluded its analysis of persecution by stating: \"I have also considered these matters singularly and cumulatively and find that they do not rise to the level of persecution in either instance. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "On the issue of state protection, the Board found that because the Czech Republic is a democracy, the presumption of state protection is strong. The Board pointed to Czech legislation which provided protection for the Roma, including anti-discrimination and hate crimes legislation. It specifically pointed to reforms in the Czech police force: the introduction of Roma Police Assistants, the recruitment of Romani police officers, and the training of police on how to better interact with minorities. The Board also noted that the Czech judiciary had prosecuted a number of hate crimes committed against the Roma and that the number of such proceedings had increased in recent years. In addition to the police, the Board pointed to other avenues of assistance for the Romani: the Czech Ombudsman, the approximately 400 Romani NGOs, the Czech Trade Inspectorate, the Czech Helsinki Committee to investigate cases of police misconduct, and the Social Inclusion Agency. The Board concluded that the \"preponderance of the documentary evidence indicates that the Czech Republic government is making very serious efforts to provide protection to the Roma whether as victims of hate crime, assist in obtaining health care or education, or inclusion into Czech society. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "With respect to the 2006 incident at the disco, the Board found that it was apparent that the police investigated the situation and took statements from bystanders and concluded that no charges were to be laid. It found that it would be difficult to arrive at a clear picture of what occurred without any police reports or other statements. With respect to the incident at the pub in 2008, the Board noted that the police arrived and chased after the attackers. As such, the police did take some action. Furthermore, the police were actively involved in investigating the fires. On the whole, the Board concluded that in cases where the applicants asked for police help, there was evidence that the police responded. Although the applicants' may not have been satisfied with the result, the Board found that they had not rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "Ultimately, the Board rejected the applicants' claim for protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "The issues before the Court are the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(a) Did the Board err in finding that the applicants did not face persecution in the Czech Republic?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(b) Did the Board err in finding that state protection was available to the applicants in the Czech Republic?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "The identification of persecution behind incidents of discrimination or harassment has consistently been reviewed by this Court against a standard of reasonableness: see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 154, at para 25;", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 950, at para 12.

They argue that it was incumbent on the Board to explain", "why", "it found that their experiences, cumulatively, did not amount to persecution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[23]", "The applicants further submit that the Board compounded this error by only addressing two of the incidents of harassment and physical attack - the 2005 incident in Pisek, and the 2007 fire incident - as part of its persecution analysis, and left other incidents for consideration as part of the state protection analysis only. They allege that the Board completely failed to address certain incidents, such as: the murder of the principal applicant's cousin (which was supported by video evidence), the attack on the principal applicant's son, and the attack on the principal applicant's brother-in-law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[24]", "The applicants also argue that the Board erred in its treatment of the documentary evidence as to persecution. They submit that the Board was selective in its treatment of the evidence regarding education, and that it completely ignored the country conditions documents on issues such as: physical attacks, employment discrimination, and housing discrimination. The applicants claim that it was incumbent on the Board to explicitly discuss this evidence as it ran counter to the Board's ultimate conclusion that the applicants' experiences had not amounted to persecution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[25]", "The respondent argues that the Board considered the physical attacks on the applicants, singularly and cumulatively, and reasonably found that they did not rise to the level of persecution.

The Federal Court of Appeal indicated in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4th) 68, at para 42, that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "...the Board is duty bound to consider all of the events which may have an impact on a claimant's claim that he or she has a well founded fear of persecution, including those events which, if taken individually, do not amount to persecution, but if taken together, may justify a claim to a well founded fear of persecution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[28]", "Justice Eleanor Dawson in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 232, at paras 4-6, indicated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "4 The following three legal principles are not controversial.

At paragraph 26 of its reasons, the Board asked the right question: \"Does the discrimination suffered by these claimants amount to persecution when considered singularly or cumulatively?\" However, the Board posed this question only after considering the applicants' past experiences sequentially; it first considered the discrimination they faced surrounding education, then the employment discrimination, followed by the discrimination by the police, and finally the physical assaults. The Board went on, after presenting a definition of \"persecution\", to conclude: \"I have ... considered these matters singularly and cumulatively and find that they do not rise to the level of persecution in either instance.\" It failed to provide any analysis of the cumulative effects of the discriminatory incidents and explain why these incidents, in the aggregate, did not amount to persecution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[32]", "Justice Yves de Montigny made a similar observation in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 154, at para 27:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "...The RPD was obviously aware of the cumulative persecution test, but in fact did not review the discriminatory acts as a whole and proceeded sequentially through the chronology recounted by the applicants without appreciating the totality or cumulative effect of their uncontradicted evidence about the treatment that they had endured.

The precise regular, three-dimensional arrangement of the molecules in a crystal, referred to as the crystal lattice, determines the physical properties of the crystalline solid, such as its melting point, its stability, the shape of the individual crystals, etc. The relationship that the individual cations and anions adopt when crystals form, and thus the structure of the lattice and the physical properties of the crystals, depends on many factors. The most important factor is the identity of the individual components that make up the crystal, because different cation and anion combinations usually adopt different relationships when they come together to form the crystal lattice. Even very subtle differences in the structure of one of the components can result in the formation of crystals with different arrangements of the cation and anions and thus different physical properties. As a consequence, it is not possible to predict the physical properties of the crystals that a salt will form.", "\"26. When a salt crystallizes, the crystals themselves remain electrically neutral; that is, the positive charges of the cations must be balanced by the presence of an equal number of negative charges from the anions.

This conclusion is bases on the calculated and measured elemental analysis results shown in Example IV, which shows a calculated percentage of 12.86 for chlorine. Based on the molecular weight of cefepime, this percentage corresponds to a dihydrochloride acid addition salt instead of a monohydrochloric acid salt addition. The measured result for chlorine of 13.03% also indicates that the product described in Example IV is indeed a dihydrochloric acid addition salt (this result can also be confirmed by noting the similarities in the calculated percentages of the various elements for both Examples IV and V, with Example V of the '288 Patent describing a dihydrochloride acid addition salt of cerepime).", "\"16. Further, the measured water content of the dihydrochloride acid addition salt of cefepime from Example IV is described to be 4.5%. The molecular weight of anhydrous cefepime dihydrochloride is 553.5, meaning that the monohydrate would theoretically possess approximately 3.15% water and the dehydrate approximately 6.11% water. Additionally, as I discussed in paragraph 10 above, stochiometric crystalline hydrates of salts (i.e., hydrates for which water molecules are regularly incorporated into the crystal lattice), as well as anhydrates, can also contain unbound or 'adventitious' water, with such water being present in varying amounts bases on such things as the hygroscopicity of the material, the degree of drying of the material and its subsequent storage conditions, etc. as a result, in my opinion, Example IV of the '288 Patent discloses cefepime dihydrochloride monohydrate (i.e., with approximately 3.15% bound water) that also contains approximately 1.35% of unbound or adventitious water.", ". . . . .", "\"55. The remainder of the specification of the '055 Patent is very similar to that of the '288 Patent, including several of the examples such as Examples IV (preparation of cefepime monohydrochloride hydrate) and V (preparation of cefepime dihydrochloride hydrate). Analogous to the case that I described above for the '288 Patent, although Example IV from the '055 Patent is entitled 'Preparation of the Monohydrochloric Acid Addition Salt', the product discussed in this example is a hydrated (4.5% water) dihydrochloric acid addition salt of cefepime based on the elemental analysis calculated and measured results. As a result, for similar reasons to those that I described in paragraphs 15 and 16 above, it is my opinion that a person skilled in the art would consider Example IV of the '055 Patent to disclose cefepime dihydrochloride monohydrate. Additionally, although the water content of the cefepime monohydrochloride hydrate salt disclosed in Example IV of the '055 Patent (4.5%) is 0.4% higher than the upper limit of the range of water content (2.5 to 4.1%) purportedly disclose in the '288 Patent for the monohydrate (e.g. as purportedly disclosed in claim 2 of the '288 Patent), it is my opinion that this 0.4% difference is insignificant, particularly given admissions of the inventors of the '729 Patent discussed in paragraphs 33 and 34 above.\""], ["[122]", "These conclusions are contested by the Applicant's experts Drs.

As they point out, based on the chloride content reported, this elemental analysis is consistent with the dihydrochloride, not with the monohydrochloride that is the stated product of the procedure. However, what Drs. McClelland and Langer have overlooked is that the reported product of this procedure cannot be cefepime dihydrochloride. The procedure of Example IV is reported to produce 900 mg of a cefepime salt starting with 1 g of the zwitterion and one equivalent of hydrochloric acid. As described, the procedure involves the combination of 1.0 g (2.08 mmoles) of cefepime with 2.08 mL (1 equivalent or 2.08 mmoles) of 1.0 N HCl to give a typical yield of 900 mg of product. If this product is the monohydrochloride (mw = 517), it represents 1.74 mmoles of material and would contain 1.74 mmoles of chloride ion. However, if it were the dihydrochloride (mw 553.5), it would contain 3.25 mmoles of chloride ion, which is more than 1.5 times as much chloride as was introduced into the reaction mixture. In short, the addition of 2.08 mmoles of hydrochloric acid to the reaction mixture is not enough chloride to give a product that contains 3.25 mmoles of chloride ion. The inescapable conclusion is that the elemental analysis reported in Example IV in the Greek '055 and Canadian '288 Patents cannot have come from the material produced from that procedure.

In my opinion, the subject matter of the claims of the '288 Patent is not new subject matter over what is set out in the '055 Patent. A chemist to whom the '288 Patent is directed would arrive at substantially pure cefepime dihydrochloride monohydrate as claimed in Claims 1 and 2, and as claimed by XRPD pattern in Claim 3 by following the teachings of the '055 Patent, in particular by reproducing Example V on a greater scale in the course of routine development. Indeed, as I have shown in the table in paragraph 49, and discussed in paragraphs 49-54, Examples XI and XII of the '288 Patent constitute no more than a simple scaling up of Example V of the '055 Patent.\""], ["[135]", "The affidavit of Dr. Langer also discusses those test results. I repeat paragraphs 64 and 69 of his affidavit:", "\"64. Finally, it appears that an increase in the scale of the runs resulted in generally similar results to those described above with the possible exception of a lower amount of unbound or adventitious water retained by the dried product. For example, a 10X increase in scale over that utilized in LSU-I-001 resulted in little change in water content after drying, as evidenced by a water content (Karl Fisher) of 4.96% (page 10) and a similar observed XRPD pattern (page 15) obtained for run LSU-I-002 as compared to the results for run LSU-I-001 described above. However, as described for run LSU-I-007, A 20X increase in scale resulted in a measured water content (Karl Fisher) for the dried product of 3.64% (page 75, with this result also supported by the Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) results shown on page 94 that display a step weight loss of a similar magnitude). The XRPD results for sample LSU-I-007-3 (pages 100 through 102) also appear to be much sharper (less diffuse) than those described above, which may indicate a reduction in the level of disordered regions present in this sample. The sharpness of the peaks also allows for a better comparison of the main peaks seen for LSU-I-007-3 as compared with those described in Example XI and claim 3 of the '288 Patent. Upon inspection, it appears that the positions and relative intensities of the peaks match up very well between these data sets (I note that several additional peaks are listed in the XRPD data corresponding to LSU-I-007-3 as compared to those listed in the '288 Patent; however, most of these additional peaks are of a low intensity and may have simply not been reported by the inventors of the '288 Patent). For example, the seven highest intensity (>20%) peaks listed in the table from claim 3 of the '288 Patent (d=10.21, 6.78, 4.74, 4.26, 3.95, 3.90 and 3.78 appear to match well with corresponding high intensity peaks seen for LSU-I-007-3 (d=10.28, 6.80, 4.75, 4.25, 3.95, 3.89 and 3.79).", ". . . . .", "\"69. Thus, the data described in the API Results in my opinion indicates that the reproduction of Example V resulted in the production of crystalline cefepime dihydrochloride monohydrate with an XRPD pattern represented by that described for LSU-I-007-3 discussed above. As described above, the XRPD pattern appears to match closely with that purportedly disclosed in Example XI and Claim 3 of the '288 Patent. Additionally, as I described above, the Karl Fisher and TGA data related to LSU-I-007-3 indicates that this material is a monohydrate. Further, the elemental analysis results for LSU-I-007-3 shown on page 89 of the API Results (i.e., %N-14.65, %C=40.00, %H= 5.17) appear further to confirm that the material is indeed cefepime dihydrochloride monohydrate. I also note that these elemental analysis results indicate that the LSU-I-007-3 material is also relatively pure. Based on this, in my opinion, one would consider said material to be substantially pure as defined in the '288 Patent as I described in paragraphs 47 through 52 above.

Considering the differences in the other characterizing data, it is not clear to me that what as produced. As noted above, Dr. Cima previously has indicated that single crystal data is determinative of crystal form, but this analysis was not done here.

He cited a number of procedural differences from Example V of the Greek '055 patent leading him to conclude that, including the modifications, it cannot be said that in every case without the possibility of error that she obtained cefepime dihydrochloride monohydrate. He said at paragraphs 23 to 27 of his reply affidavit:", "\"23. In Experiment LSU-I-007, the procedure Ms. Corelli-Rennie followed differed from that of Example V of the Greek '055 Patent in several respects. First, Ms. Corelli-Rennie's experiment was carried out at about 20 times the scale of Example V. Second, the first and second portions of acetone were added to the hydrochloric acid solution of cefepime over 50-minute and 60-minute periods, instead of the 5-minute periods specified in Example V. And third, after filtration and washing, the wet filter cake was allowed to sit for 4 days, in a closed sample vial, before the material was placed in the vacuum oven and freed from residual solvent. No such interval is described or implied in the Greek '055 Patent. The final material was again analyzed by NMR, PXRD, KF and elemental analysis. The sharp peaks in the PXRD analysis show that crystalline material was obtained.", "\"24. The PXRD analysis of the product of Experiment LSU-I-007 is similar to that of the PXRD disclosed and claimed in the '288 patent, but it is not identical. While the KF and elemental analyses of this material are consistent with monohydrate, no single crystal X-ray analysis was performed. I note that Apotex's expert, Dr. Cima, would consider this analysis to be the definitive way to characterize the crystalline form of this material and to determine whether it was the claimed monohydrate or not.", "\"25. In my opinion, Ms. Corelli-Rennie did not obtain a different result in this experiment because she performed it on larger scale than Example V of the Greek '055 Patent. In her Experiments LSU-I -002 and LSU-I-005, she had increased the scale 10-fold and 5.4-fold and obtained the same results as the on-scale experiments. In my opinion, she obtained a different result in this experiment because of the other procedural differences. By slow addition of the acetone portions, she brought the cefepime dihydrochloride out of solution much more slowly than occurred in the experiments that more closely followed Example V. Decreasing the solubility of a compound slowly has long been understood to be more conducive to formation of a crystalline, as opposed to an amorphous or poorly crystalline, material. Moreover, even if an amorphous or poorly crystalline form of cefepime dihydrochloride of ill-defined water content had been formed, by standing for 4 days as a wet product alter filtration and washing with acetone, without evaporation, or other means by which the excess solvent could be removed, it could have been transformed into the crystalline material. A significant amount of excess solvent was present in the wet material, as its weight was reduced from 5.21 g to 5.05 g when it was eventually dried.", "\"26. Whichever one of these procedural modifications was responsible for the different result Ms. Corelli-Rennie obtained in Experiment LSU-I-007, they were not part of Example V of the '055 Patent. The time period over which the acetone portions are added was clearly stated as 5 minutes, not 50 and 60 minutes. No time period is stated for the interval between filtering and washing the product with acetone and placing it in a vacuum oven for drying, but one of skill in the art would understand the phrase 'The crystals are removed by vacuum filtration, washed with two 5 ml portions of acetone and vacuum dried at 40-45 deg. C for 24 hours' to mean that there is no intervening time period. Indeed, it was Ms. Corelli-Rennie's usual procedure to dry her products immediately after filtration and washing.", "Summary of Experiments Relating to Example V", "\"27.

What I propose here is that the fees be allowed to one particular expert shall not be disproportionately large when compared to the fees charged by any other expert for any other party. In this case, I have not found any particular expert to be significantly more helpful, or put another way, more valuable than another.

I have therefore left the matter to be considered by counsel on the basis that no fee shall be allowed that is disproportionately large."], ["[192]", "Further, fees for experts shall be limited to fees for the services only of the experts who attested to affidavits filed by Apotex in this proceeding namely Drs.

They fear persecution on the grounds of race and membership in a particular social group."], ["[4]", "The Applicants allege they suffered various and ongoing forms of discrimination because of their Roma ethnicity. The father's Personal Information Form (PIF) recounts harassment, intimidation and other forms of persecution at the hands of Skinheads, Neo-nazis and Caucasians while growing up and continuing on in adulthood. The Applicants regularly faced discrimination from their neighbours. The children were harassed at school."], ["[5]", "The PIF lists several specific incidents. Among them, Neo-nazis threw a molotov cocktail through the Applicants' window in 2001. The father claims he was viciously attacked by Skinheads in 2006. He was stabbed during the incident. In 2002 a neighbourhood Caucasian child threatened to kill Lucie with a rock. Terezie was falsely accused of stealing a cell phone at school in 2000. Her mother was called. The incident escalated and the mother needed to call the police."], ["[6]", "According to the PIF the police were called after each one of these incidents, but the result was the same. The police would take part in questioning but nothing else would ever happen. However, on at least one occasion the father admitted to being too afraid to press charges."], ["[7]", "Michaela left home in 2008 and did not return. A few weeks later, some Ukrainian-Russian men allegedly entered the Applicants' home and attacked the family, warning them not to look for Michaela, otherwise risk being killed.

The Board found that the determinative issue in the claim was state protection. While the Board acknowledged that the experience of the Applicants was mixed with respect to the ability and willingness of the state to protect, the Board found that when the Applicants called the police they responded. While the protection offered was not always effective, the Board found that the Applicants had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection based on the test of adequacy. The Applicants were unable to provide clear and convincing evidence that the Czech state is unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection. The Board went on to examine what efforts the Czech Republic has undertaken to protect Roma, and the effects of those efforts.

The Board based this first conclusion on its characterization of the evidence relating to the boyfriend as unreliable. Michaela testified that her boyfriend started hitting her when she declined to marry him, yet, this information was not provided in her Port of Entry (POE) interview or PIF.

Firstly, the Board ought to have considered that the boyfriend has an interest in finding Michaela as he has enforceable rights and obligations to the child.

Thirdly, the Board erred in failing to explain why they ignored the evidence that the boyfriend had called her and threatened her in Canada."], ["[17]", "With respect, I find no reviewable error with respect to any of the above issues.

So now two parents have rights to the child, both the man and the woman but one of them, if they're separated, usually one of them gets custody which means they get to care for them and keep them and raise them and so on and sometimes it takes a court to decide which parent gets to do that and sometimes it turns out the mom gets the child and the dad is supposed to support with some finances and gets to see the child once in a while and sometimes it's the other way around.", "So is there a court in the Czech Republic that you can or your daughter can go and do that?

The Board noted that there are concerns that these efforts are not adequate but that the preponderance of the evidence indicates that the state is taking action against extremists and does not condone or acquiesce to extremist actions, and those actions are effective. The Board further notes that discrimination against the Roma in the Czech Republic is prevalent. However, that Czech Republic was taking steps to assist the Roma in several ways to ensure that they would be able to participate in Czech society. Among these initiatives was the establishment of an agency to combat the social exclusion experienced by the Roma and improve socio-economic conditions through improved access to employment and mainstream education."], ["[28]", "The Applicants did not provide any clear and convincing evidence that the Czech Republic continues to be unable or unwilling to protect them. In fact, the father recounted an incident in his PIF where the police told a family that was harassing the Applicants \"to be grateful that the Kaleja family was not pressing charges and prosecuting the case.\" The father goes on to say that they were afraid of pressing charges because they feared retaliation.

I do not find this argument persuasive. The doctrine of cumulative persecution allows for the possibility that non-persecutory actions may accumulate and give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution. In the present matter, there was never any dispute that the harassment and discrimination suffered by the Applicants amounted to persecution due to their ethnicity. The Board did not find otherwise. What the Board did find, and what disposed of the Applicants' claim, was that the state was able to offer them adequate protection."], ["[31]", "The Applicants relied on", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4th) 68 in making the cumulative persecution argument. However, as the Respondent submits, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> has the effect of reaffirming that, as the Board determined in the instant matter, the availability of state protection is key for determining whether the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution. The Court stated at para 45:"], ["[45] The plain fact is that whether a claimant relies on a single or a number of events taken together, he still has the obligation to satisfy the Board that, at the time of the hearing, he has a well founded fear of persecution in regard to the country from which he seeks protection. He has to show that by reason of a Convention ground, he is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. Thus, in the present matter, are the respondents unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of Rwanda or, to put it in a different way, is Rwanda able to protect the respondents should they return?", "D.

After receiving two such threats, he fled Honduras. Upon his arrival in Canada in November 2008, he claimed refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the", "Immigration and Refugee Protection Act", ", SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[2]", "In June 2010, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected his claims.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "The Applicant submitted that the RPD erred by:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(i) determining that there was no nexus between his stated fears and the Convention refugee ground of membership in a particular social group, namely, young males who are targeted for membership in the MS 18;", "(ii) determining that his claimed risks are \"faced generally by other individuals in or from Honduras,\" as contemplated by paragraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "(iii) ignoring certain evidence in reaching its decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the RPD did not commit any of those alleged errors.

He allegedly suffered a knife wound to his hand and was also knocked unconscious for a period of time. He claims that he reported the incident to the police approximately one week later, but was told that since he could not provide a thorough description of his attackers and because there were no witnesses, they could not follow up on his report.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "Mr. Lainez further claims that on November 27, 2006, he was approached again by three members of the MS 18 as he was leaving church.

He claims that there was a note attached to the motorcycle which stated: \"This is proof that we know where you live and you only have a few days left to join the Mara. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "On December 5, 2006, Mr. Lainez fled Honduras. He travelled through Mexico and entered the United States on January 16, 2007. During his stay in the United States, he did not make a claim for asylum, allegedly because he feared that his claim would be rejected and that he would then be deported to Honduras. He remained with relatives in the United States until he heard about the availability of refugee protection in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "II.", "The Decision under Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "At the outset of its decision, the RPD stated that the determinative issue in respect of Mr. Lainez's claim for protection under section 96 of the IRPA was whether there was a nexus between his stated fears and one of the five grounds of protection set forth in that section. Those grounds are race, religion, nationality, political opinion and membership in a particular social group.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "The RPD began its assessment of this issue by noting that Mr. Lainez fears that the MS 18 will harm or kill him because he did not comply with their demand to join the gang. After briefly reviewing Mr. Lainez's allegations, the RPD stated that his \"decision to flee was because he did not want to be a victim of the gang.\" It then concluded that Mr. Lainez was \"a victim of crime,\" and that therefore his stated fear is not linked to any of the five Convention refugee grounds set forth in section 96.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The RPD then considered Mr. Lainez's claim under section 97. It noted that: (i) the assessment of risk under section 97 must be specific to the individual, in that the evidence must establish a specific, individualized risk of harm with regard to the particular claimant; and (ii) the risk must not be indiscriminate or random and one faced generally by the population of the country in question. It added that the fact that a group of people may be victimized by criminals repeatedly or more frequently than others does not satisfy the requirements of section 97 if that risk is faced generally by others in the country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "The RPD proceeded to note that the Applicant was victimized because he was  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"spotted by gang members as a suitable person to rob as he was walking alone on a street.\" It concluded that \"he had no particular characteristic except that he was unfortunately walking alone on both occasions when the gang members were looking for someone to rob.\" It then observed: \"The second time the claimant was robbed, the gang members also attempted to recruit the claimant into their gang. However, this does not establish that the risk is not one that is faced generally by the population in Honduras. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "In the course of reviewing the documentary evidence, the RPD observed that: (i) the \"failure to cooperate [with the MS 18] often leads to violence by gang members\"; (ii) gangs and the MS are a widespread problem in Honduras; and (iii) membership is based on individuals' proximity to gangs in their community, rather than resulting from an official recruitment process.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "Ultimately, the RPD found that the risk identified by Mr. Lainez is one that is faced generally by others in Honduras.

When asked why they had been pursuing her, he replied \"the same reason as mine.\" When the panel member then pointed out that she is not a male and that he had earlier stated that the MS 18 pursue young men to join their gang, he replied: \"Well, the problem is they kill the [", "sic", "] whole families.\" He later added: \"[W] hat I really think is that they want to kill her because I am not there, and I said they kill entire families. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[19]", "A short while later in the hearing, Mr. Lainez stated that nothing gets by the MS 18 and \"that is why everybody [in Honduras] is so terrified, that is why everybody pays the war tax right now.\" A few minutes later, he added: \"One has to pay a war tax just to live; it does not matter, if they need more money sometimes yeah they will go and attack you, they will mug you.\" He then observed that these types of incidents occur \"daily. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[20]", "Considering the foregoing testimony, together with the country documentation to which the RPD referred later in its decision, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for the RPD to conclude that Mr. Lainez was a victim of crime, rather than a member of a particular social group consisting of young men who are specifically targeted for robbery and violence by the MS 18 (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "In short, it was reasonably open to the RPD to conclude, based on the evidentiary record, that Mr. Lainez was not targeted by the MS 18 because he was a young male. As the RPD subsequently explained, it found that he was robbed and assaulted because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

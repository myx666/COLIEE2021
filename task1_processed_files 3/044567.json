Can the C.R.D.D. take into account other factors beyond the crime(s) committed outside the country of origin which might aggravate or mitigate a finding of 'serious non-political crime'? For example, can a continued pattern of crime within the country of refuge or testimony showing a complete lack of remorse or rehabilitation in relation to such crime(s) engage the exclusionary provision? <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "I agree that these are serious questions of general importance concerning Article 1F(b) and raise issues directly related to these reasons.

The Officer noted that the Applicant's H&C application was based on the emotional and physical dependency placed upon the Applicant by his extended Canadian family, including his aunt, uncle, and their five children. The Officer acknowledged that the Applicant's cousins depended on the Applicant for physical care and emotional support, but noted that the children would be cared for by their biological parents in Canada if the Applicant applied for permanent residency outside of Canada."], ["[5]", "The Officer also considered the hardships caused to the family if the Applicant was required to make his application from outside Canada and concluded that they would not be \"more unusual and undeserved or disproportionate then [sic] other family members in Canada face who are separated from their relatives outside of Canada.\""], ["[6]", "The Officer then noted that the Applicant could return to the United States to join his wife, a U.S. citizen, who may be able to provide emotional and financial support to the Applicant, and that such a return would support the interests of family re-unification. The Officer also acknowledged that if the Applicant returned to Jordan, the country conditions would be less appealing than those in Canada, but held that the conditions he would face were no more unusual or undeserved with respect to hardships than those faced by other persons in Jordan and in other countries.

Rather, the interests of the child must be \"well identified and defined\" (Legault, at para. 12) and \"examined ... with a great deal of attention\" (Legault, at para. 30).

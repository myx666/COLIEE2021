The employer then has a duty to investigate the matter. If at the end of the investigation the employee believes the danger continues to exists, the employee may continue to refuse to work. It is at this stage that a health and safety officer is notified (subsection 128(13)). The health and safety officer then conducts an investigation and determines whether a danger exists and as a corollary, whether the employee may continue to refuse to work (s. 129(6)).

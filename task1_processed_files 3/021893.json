When the applicant appealed the 1985 decision deporting him, he argued his new facts, for the first time, before a Board, stating that he was at risk if he were returned to India. The Board heard that argument, assessed that evidence and rejected it as 'mere speculation'. Further, when the applicant appealed to the Minister on compassionate and humanitarian grounds, he relied, for a second time on the new facts about the danger he would face if he returned to India. The Minister, in rejecting his claim, presumably considered this new evidence and was not persuaded. Later, when he sought to reopen the 1989 decision of the Appeal Division, he argued, for the third time, his new facts that he was at risk and again he was unsuccessful. In launching his last application to reopen the 1985 inquiry, which is under attack here, the applicant sought to rely, for a fourth time, on the new facts of the danger he would now face if he were to be returned to India, and again he was not successful in convincing the adjudicator to reopen the inquiry. He nevertheless, comes to this court, and urges me that his s. 7 rights were violated by the adjudicator. I am not persuaded. The applicant has had ample opportunity to convince tribunals of the importance of his new facts, and each time he has failed. This is not a denial of fundamental justice.

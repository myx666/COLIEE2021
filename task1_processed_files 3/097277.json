The Member unreasonably focused on those documents where authenticity appeared doubtful, and ignored those documents that appeared trustworthy. The Member was bound to fairly consider all of the documents but made no effort to ascertain the authenticity of the other documents. Therefore, her finding on identity, which was determinative of the entire claim, was made without considering the totality of the evidence, and this was a reviewable error (", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[9]", "As to the birth certificate, graduation certificate, divorce certificate and electricity bill, the Member made a factual error in stating that the documents have no security features, as the certificates all bore official stamps (", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED).

She had testified, in connection with her driver's licence, that the reason it appeared brand new and smelled strongly of mothballs was that her mother had carefully stored the Applicants' identity documents in a drawer (CTR at 545). When asked why then her mother could not locate the birth certificates, the Principal Applicant testified that \"I ... I had told her to find those carefully, but maybe sometimes if she took those out and then she did not remember where she put them back\" (CTR, pp 545-46). In my view, the Member's finding that this explanation was purely speculative was, in the absence of any other evidence, reasonably open to her. As to her finding that it was implausible that the Principal Applicant would have entrusted her mother with finding and sending her the documents if her mother was not competent to do so, I agree with the Applicants that the implausibility finding was not well grounded. However, little turns on the point, given that the explanation that the Principal Applicant offered as to why her mother could not locate the birth certificates was reasonably not accepted by the Member."], ["[33]", "The Applicants also assert that a reviewable error and breach of procedural fairness arise from the failure of the Member to give notice to the Principal Applicant about her concerns with the authenticity of the immunization records and an opportunity to respond. In this regard they rely on", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", ". In that case Justice Rennie was considering a letter which, on its face, appeared legitimate. He stated that if the RDP was of the view that the letter was not authentic and relied on specialized knowledge to impugn it as fraudulent, then the RPD should have said so and provided the applicant with the opportunity to respond. This was a breach of procedural fairness as well as of Rule 18, which requires that before using any information or opinion that is within the RPD's specialized knowledge it must notify the claimant of this and provide an opportunity to respond. In this instance, the Member in her reasons did not state that she was relying on specialized knowledge. Further, the Member had made her suspicion that some of the documents were not authentic, albeit not specifically singling out the immigration records. The Applicants were afforded the opportunity to respond to the concern at large and did so. In any event, the immigration records do not establish the Minor Applicant's identity."], ["[34]", "In conclusion, the burden was on the Applicants to establish their identity.

The issue of identity is at the very core of the RPD's expertise and the Court should be cautious about intervening in such decisions (", "FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED).

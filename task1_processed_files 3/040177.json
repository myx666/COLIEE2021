So the notion of accessing private health insurance, for the refugees I see, and the refugee claimants I see it's not on the radar. So it's out there and I would hope that people know that, it's not really something that's attainable for most people\": Rashid cross-examination at question 289."], ["[272]", "Indeed, the respondents accept that the beneficiaries of the IFHP program are generally vulnerable, poor and disadvantaged.

Finally, patients still have to pay to fill prescriptions that they receive through hospital emergency rooms.", "(6) Social Assistance"], ["[279]", "The respondents also suggest that going on social assistance is another way that IFHP beneficiaries can access health insurance. Indeed, Mr. Bradley observed that Mr. Ayubi would likely have been better off in terms of his ability to access health care had he simply quit his job and gone on social assistance."], ["[280]", "At the same time, the respondents acknowledge that privately-sponsored refugees are banned from going on social assistance for their first year in Canada, with the result that this is not a viable option for these individuals."], ["[281]", "Moreover, provincial social assistance programs do not provide comprehensive medical benefits to recipients. Where health benefits are provided, they only cover things like medication and supplementary services, but do not ordinarily extend to cover the cost of doctor's visits, pre-natal care, diagnostic testing etc."], ["[282]", "To the extent that cost containment was identified as an objective of the 2012 changes to the IFHP, it must also be recognized that there are costs associated with forcing people to go onto social assistance in order to access potentially life-saving medications and medical treatment. These include, of course, the direct financial cost of the social assistance benefits themselves."], ["[283]", "There is, however, also an intangible cost to human dignity that comes with forcing people to quit their jobs and go on welfare in order to access medical care.

It is simply demeaning to require desperately ill people to go begging for essential medical treatment.", "(8) Section 7 Discretionary IFHP Coverage"], ["[287]", "The last alternate source of medical insurance coverage identified by the respondents is section 7 discretionary IFHP coverage."], ["[288]", "It will be recalled that in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of the 2012 OIC, the Minister retains the discretion to pay the cost of health care coverage, public health or public safety health care coverage or immigration medical examinations \"in exceptional and compelling circumstances\". Mr. Ayubi was ultimately the beneficiary of such discretionary IFHP coverage for his diabetes-related medical services, but not for his medication."], ["[289]", "Once again, this may be a satisfactory source of alternate medical insurance coverage for some individuals, but it does not come close to compensating for the loss of health care benefits resulting from the 2012 changes to the IFHP."], ["[290]", "First, the Minister's discretion under section 7 of the OIC does not extend to cover the cost of medications or immunizations, unless they are required to treat a condition that involves a threat to public health or safety."], ["[291]", "Second, it is conceded by the respondents that the existence of Ministerial discretion under section 7 of the OIC is not designed to address emergency medical situations. The concession that the exercise of this discretion is not a viable option in emergencies is supported by the evidence regarding Mr. Ayubi's request for discretionary relief, which was outstanding for five months before it was approved. Indeed, Ms. Fortin admitted on her cross-examination that many requests for section 7 relief had been outstanding for several months."], ["[292]", "Moreover, although the 2012 OICs are publicly available documents, as is CIC's 2013 policy manual dealing with the IFHP, it appears that the existence of section 7 Ministerial discretion is not widely known. This is demonstrated by the fact that, as of the date of the record, only 23 requests for discretionary relief had been received by CIC."], ["[293]", "Finally, section 7 relief is discretionary, and thus, by definition, uncertain.", "(9) Conclusion Regarding the Alternatives to IFHP Funded Health Care"], ["[294]", "The respondents repeatedly emphasized that in every case cited by the applicants, the individuals in question were ultimately able to obtain the medical care that they required. According to the respondents, this is proof that there are satisfactory alternatives to federally-funded health care insurance benefits for those involved in the refugee process."], ["[295]", "There are a number of reasons why I do not accept this submission."], ["[296]", "The first is that it is factually incorrect. We know that Mr. Ayubi has", "not", "been able to obtain all of the medical care that he requires. He has been unable to get some of his medications, which his doctor says \"will undoubtedly be disastrous for him ... and will ultimately ... be far more expensive to the health care system when he inevitably presents with complications placing him in a life and death situation\": Ayubi affidavit, Exhibit A."], ["[297]", "We also know that Mr. Ayubi's inability to access prescribed medication has in fact already caused him physical harm. That is, when one of Mr. Ayubi's anti-hypertensive drugs was not available though his community health centre, an alternative medication had to be substituted. This caused him to suffer a hypotensive crisis, requiring the administration of intravenous fluids at a community health centre to restore his blood pressure."], ["[298]", "There are, moreover, numerous short-comings in all of the alternate sources of health care identified by the respondents. These other sources of health care are not always timely. We know that it was only through the goodwill of Mr. Garcia Rodrigues' ophthalmologist, who agreed to perform his surgery for a fraction of the usual price, that he did not lose the vision in his eye, which could have impaired his ability to support his family."], ["[299]", "The respondents' proposed alternatives are also uncertain, and do not take into account the psychological harm inflicted on people like Mr. Akhtar, who, on top of receiving a cancer diagnosis, was left wondering whether or not he would be able to receive life-saving chemotherapy treatments."], ["[300]", "Nor do the respondents' proposed alternatives take into account the negative impact on human dignity that flows from forcing people to have to rely on the charity of others for life-saving medical treatments."], ["[301]", "The respondents concede that people have probably been harmed by the 2012 changes to the IFHP: Transcript, Vol. 2 at p. 119. Given the number of people affected by the changes, and the uncertain and unsatisfactory nature of the alternative avenues of care, this is undoubtedly true. Indeed, I accept the evidence of Dr. Rachlis, to the extent that he asserts that the changes to the IFHP are most certainly causing illness and disability.

This is particularly, but not exclusively, so with respect to children who have been brought to this country by their parents. The 2012 modifications to the IFHP potentially jeopardize the health, and indeed the very lives, of these innocent and vulnerable children in a manner that shocks the conscience and outrages our standards of decency. They violate section 12 of the Charter."], ["[1081]", "I have also concluded that the 2012 changes to the IFHP violate section 15 of the Charter inasmuch as it now provides a lesser level of health insurance coverage to refugee claimants from DCO countries in comparison to that provided to refugee claimants from non-DCO countries. This distinction is based entirely upon the national origin of the refugee claimants, and does not form part of an ameliorative program."], ["[1082]", "Moreover, this distinction has an adverse differential effect on refugee claimants from DCO countries. It puts their lives at risk, and perpetuates the stereotypical view that they are cheats, that their refugee claims are \"bogus\", and that they have come to Canada to abuse the generosity of Canadians. It undermines their dignity and serves to perpetuate the disadvantage suffered by members of an admittedly vulnerable, poor and disadvantaged group."], ["[1083]", "I have not, however, been persuaded that the IFHP violates subsection 15(1) of the Charter based upon the immigration status of those seeking the protection of Canada, as \"immigration status\" cannot be considered to be an analogous ground for the purposes of subsection 15(1).

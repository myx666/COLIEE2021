My reasons are reported at 343 F.T.R. 298; 2009 FC 374. It had been agreed during the hearing that the parties would prefer to discuss costs after the decision was rendered. In particular, the applicants were seeking costs against the Minister on a solicitor-client basis. The interveners were also seeking costs which are not presently before me."], ["[2]", "The Minister now moves for an order against the applicants jointly and severally in the lump sum amount of $35,187.39. The motion was accompanied by a draft bill of costs calculated on Column III of Tariff B, which is the default provision. It is clear that the draft did not capture all relevant disbursements, particularly airfares. I am confident that if a bill of costs were taxed, it would be taxed for at least $35,000, and probably more. However, since any taxation may well be symbolic, the Minister was persuaded to settle for a lump sum of $30,000. I so order."], ["[3]", "This motion raises two issues: entitlement to costs and the amount thereof. The applicants did not have much to say with respect to quantum, although some concern was expressed that the disbursements were proportionately high when compared to the fees. However, the reduction to $30,000 more than addresses that concern. The objections to the taxation were more on principle.

There was a time when the 'rule of dignity' dictated that the Crown neither asked nor paid costs in the ordinary course of events. That time is long past ... .\""], ["[6]", "All things being equal, costs are usually awarded to the successful party. The Minister is not seeking enhanced costs based on any of the factors set out in Rule 400."], ["[7]", "It has been held as a matter of policy that the Court should, when instances allow of it, favour lump sum orders, primarily guided by the standards established in Tariff B. As stated by Mr. Justice Hugessen in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) at paragraph 11:", "\"... In my view, as a matter of policy the Court should favour lump sum orders. It saves time and trouble for the parties and it is a more efficient method for them to know what their liability is for costs.

I hold entitlement to costs was not waived.", "PUBLIC INTEREST"], ["[10]", "This is not, in my view, a case where public interest dictates a particular result with respect to costs. The Honour of the Crown was not at stake. The case was limited to breaches of a funding arrangement and the remedies available to the Minister.

Mr. Justice Kelen concluded at paragraph 68: \"... The Custom Council could have sought legal advice before seeking to remove the applicants from office in the middle of their term, which may have removed the basis for the applicants' legal action.

However, that was a case which dealt with solicitor-client costs. The Minister is not seeking solicitor-client costs, or even enhanced costs on the basis that the case became unduly complex because the applicants resurrected issues going back fifteen years before the decision to impose third party management was made.", "LIABILITY OF THE BAND"], ["[14]", "Finally, the applicants say that if costs are to be taxed they should be taxed against the Band itself. I do not subscribe to this view. I held that the four applicants, be they as the Elders Council, or as individual Band members, had no standing. There was nothing in the record to indicate that the Band counsel itself was unable to institute proceedings. In fact, just after the application was launched the Council passed a resolution in support. This suggested to me that the applicants were being put up as straw men, immune to costs, or so as to avoid the application being discontinued should the then-Council be replaced by a new one which did not wish to pursue the litigation.

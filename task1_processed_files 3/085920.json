The investigator also concluded that the evidence on record did not support his allegations that he had been humiliated by Ms. Smolynec. The applicant also claimed that Ms. Smolynec had criticized him for no good reason and had not taken into consideration his vision problems, namely, that he suffers from cataracts. The investigator, however, noted in her report that Ms. Smolynec was aware that the applicant had problems with his eyes because he had to take time off work, although she did not know what the exact problem was.

On this point, the investigator concluded that the evidence did not support the applicant's position. The applicant also claimed that he had asked his supervisor multiple times for changes. The investigator concluded that the applicant no longer worked for Ms. Dielh-MacLean and Ms. Smolynec and now reports to another supervisor, Terry Brown, and to another manager, André Voltaire.

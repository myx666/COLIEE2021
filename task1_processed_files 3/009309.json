The RPD did not accept his explanation that this was due to an interpreter or consultant error, since the PIF had been translated back to him before he signed it;", "• He had engaged a smuggler some three months before his practice group was raided, allegedly because he was afraid he might have to leave the country on short notice. Since the Applicant had a wife and a child in China, the RPD did not believe he would continue practicing Falun Gong if he was that afraid of being discovered as such;", "• His alleged fear of discovery was inconsistent with the fact that he never made any substantial inquiries into the safety of his Falun Gong group practices or how long they had been operating;", "• There was a discrepancy in the amount of money he said that he paid the smuggler;", "• He claimed that he had gone to four or five different doctors about his back, but only supplied a medical booklet for one visit. He claimed that he lost the booklets recording the other visits, but the RPD found that those visits should have been recorded in the same booklet and that, in any event, the smuggler would have told the Applicant about the importance of keeping documentation;", "• The Applicant testified that his back condition was improving just by performing the qi qong exercises without learning any Falun Gong philosophy. Since qi qong exercises are legal and were working, the RPD did not believe that the Applicant would take the risk of joining a Falun Gong group;", "• The Applicant originally said that he never learned any philosophy with the group, and it was only after he was asked by the RPD that he mentioned an older member who would occasionally come and read to the group;", "• The Applicant testified before the RPD that his Falun Gong group had no instructor, but in his PIF he had stated that lookouts alerted his instructor about the alleged raid;", "• The Applicant testified that he ran away during the raid by the PSB and never looked back, but the RPD considered it unlikely that he would not look back to see if he was being followed;", "• At the hearing, the Applicant stated that he went to his wife's aunt's house after the raid, but he had told an immigration officer that he had gone to a friend's house;", "• There were some inconsistencies about when the PSB required the Applicant to report to them and also as to whether the PSB mentioned Falun Gong on their first visit to the home of the Applicant's parents;", "• Only when questioned by the RPD did the Applicant say that the PSB looked for him at work; and", "• The Applicant called Falun Gong a religion in his PIF narrative, but at the hearing testified that Falun Gong was not a religion."], ["[5]", "In view of the foregoing findings, the RPD rejected the Applicant's credibility and found that he had never practiced Falun Gong in China.

Moreover, it is well-established that deference is to be afforded to the findings of a tribunal such as the RPD in matters of credibility."], ["[14]", "The central issue before the Court, therefore, is whether the RPD made unreasonable credibility and plausibility findings with respect to the Applicant's claims and, in particular, whether the RPD's conclusion that the Applicant was not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner was reasonable."], ["[15]", "A useful summary of the principles that should be applied to a review of the RPD's credibility findings can be found in", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED, where my colleague Madam Justice Mary Gleason states as follows:", "42", "First, and perhaps most importantly, the starting point in reviewing a credibility finding is the recognition that the role of this Court is a very limited one because the tribunal had the advantage of hearing the witnesses testify, observed their demeanor and is alive to all the factual nuances and contradictions in the evidence. Moreover, in many cases, the tribunal has expertise in the subject matter at issue that the reviewing court lacks. It is therefore much better placed to make credibility findings, including those related to implausibility. Also, the efficient administration of justice, which is at the heart of the notion of deference, requires that review of these sorts of issues be the exception as opposed to the general rule. As stated in", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED:", "There is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review...", "(see also", "CITATION_SUPPRESSED and", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED).", "43", "Second, contradictions in the evidence, particularly in a refugee claimant's own testimony, will usually afford the RPD a reasonable basis for finding the claimant to lack credibility, and, if this finding is reasonable, the rejection of the entire refugee claim will not be interfered with by the Court (see e.g.", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED). That said, the contradictions which underpin a negative credibility finding must be real as opposed to illusory. Thus, the tribunal cannot seize on truly trivial or minute contradictions to reject a claim (see e.g.", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED).", "44", "Third, while the sworn testimony of a claimant is to be presumed to be true in the absence of contradiction, it may reasonably be rejected if the RPD finds it to be implausible. However, a finding of implausibility must be rational and must also be duly sensitive to cultural differences. It must also be clearly expressed and the basis for the finding must be apparent in the tribunal's reasons (see e.g.", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED;", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED).", "45", "Fourth, the RPD may legitimately have regard to witness demeanor, including hesitations, vagueness and changing or elaborating on their versions of events. These sorts of matters may reasonably underpin a credibility finding, but it is preferable if there are additional objective facts to support the finding (seeREFERENCE_SUPPRESSED).", "46", "Finally, where a decision turns on credibility, it is incumbent on the RPD to provide reasons for its assessment given the importance of the issues at stake in a refugee claim. A generalized, imprecise and vague credibility conclusion without particulars is subject to being set aside on review (see e.g.", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[16]", "With these principles in mind, the Court must respect and cannot interfere with a decision unless it is satisfied that the reasons of the RPD are not justified, transparent or intelligible and that the result does not fall \"within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED)."], ["[17]", "The Applicant argues that the RPD conducted a microscopic analysis of trivial inconsistencies, something which this Court has disallowed in cases such as:", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED; and", "REFERENCE_SUPPRESSED.

While the RPD did make negative findings with respect to a few peripheral issues, such as the place to where the Applicant fled following the alleged raid by the PSB in 2011, a number of the negative findings were clearly supported by the evidence and related to central aspects of the Applicant's claim.

Subsection 6(5) of the", "Trade-marks Act", "provides that in determining whether trade-marks are confusing, the Court is to have regard to (1) the inherent distinctiveness of the trade-marks and the extent to which they have become known, (2) the length of time the trade-marks have been in use, (3) the nature of the wares, services or business, (4) the nature of the trade, and (5) the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them. This is not an exhaustive list of factors and the weight to be given to any factor will vary with \"all the surrounding circumstances\"."], ["[16]", "AREVA and AECL make the following submissions on these factors."], ["[17]", "With respect to distinctiveness, AREVA submits that AECL's Flying A Design Mark has little inherent distinctiveness; letters are \"weak\" marks entitled to a narrow ambit of protection. It further submits that AECL has not produced evidence that its mark has been used in the marketing of nuclear reactor products and services so as to acquire distinctiveness. AECL submits that both AECL's Flying A Design and AREVA's A Design Mark possess equal inherent distinctiveness. It argues that AREVA has not adduced evidence that its mark has any acquired distinctiveness, whereas there is evidence before the Court that AECL's Flying A Design Mark has been used and is used on virtually all of AECL's letterheads, business cards, proposals, invoices, brochures, signage, equipment, trucks, uniforms, hardhats, products and advertisements."], ["[18]", "With respect to the length of time the marks have been in use, AREVA submits that although AECL's Flying A Design Mark has been registered since the late 1960s, on cross-examination AECL's witness Dale Coffin could not attest to the use of the mark since the date of registration.

AREVA submits that the \"hasty impression\" test is not appropriate to the nuclear business because the relevant consumers undertake a judicious inquiry of the wares or services to be purchased. They submit that AECL and AREVA sell and service different types of nuclear reactors and that all existing reactors in Canada are AECL CANDU reactors. Currently, there is no market in Canada for any of AREVA's Nuclear Reactor products related to its light-water reactors. Purchasers of nuclear reactors, they submit, are familiar with the underlying technology, and in any event AREVA and AECL market their reactors using the trade-marks EPR and CANDU/ACR 1000 respectively. All of AECL's experts acknowledged in cross-examination that the relevant consumers would not be confused into purchasing the wrong nuclear reactor."], ["[20]", "AREVA notes that the purchase of a nuclear reactor is not a regular occurrence in Canada. AECL has not sold a reactor in Canada in the past decade and AREVA has never sold a reactor in Canada. The nuclear reactor products and services business is a global business with a limited number of global competitors who are known to industry players. AREVA submits that whether the public at large might be confused is completely irrelevant in the context of a sale of nuclear reactor products and services. The relevant customers, they argue, are provincial governments and major power utilities. The market for nuclear products and services is extensively regulated. Suppliers of safety-related products must be government qualified and they are audited by CANPAC, a unified industry organization, for quality. Procurement decisions involve multiple individuals conducting multiple reviews and approvals over a relatively long period of time. Customers often have master services agreements with suppliers for the provision of parts and services, which have been negotiated over a period of years. Nuclear reactor services that do go out for bid are multi-million dollar contracts. In this environment, customers are not confused with whom they are dealing."], ["[21]", "AECL submits that it and AREVA are direct competitors and both compete for the provision of parts and services for CANDU reactors. In relation to procurement of nuclear products and services, AECL has adduced evidence from the customer's perspective, whereas AREVA has not. William Bohlke's evidence is that a vendor's particular technology is only one factor in procurement decisions. In his experience, a logo can play an important role in the overall impression of decision makers as to a vendor's capabilities. Links to customer's jurisdiction are equally important. In relation to Ontario Power's request for proposal for a \"New Build,\" it would be important to be perceived as having experience and a significant presence in Ontario. Because so many individuals are involved in procurement decisions, not all of them with a technical expertise, there is a heightened risk of confusion arising as a matter of first impression."], ["[22]", "AREVA submits that there is an immediate and obvious difference in the two marks due to the flying atom or ball that appears at the front of AECL's Flying A Design Mark. It relies on", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) as authority for the proposition that the degree of resemblance must be judged discounting the underlying A's in common use. As a consequence, they submit, the appearance and ideas suggested by the two marks is quite different."], ["[23]", "AECL notes that AREVA has admitted that both marks are stylized A's and it submits that as a matter of first impression, therefore, they are very similar."], ["[24]", "Having reviewed the affidavit evidence relied upon by the parties, as well as the case-law placed before the Court, I agree with AREVA that of the factors going to confusion enumerated at subsection 6(5) of the", "Trade-Marks Act,", "in this case the nature of the wares, services, and business, and the nature of the trade, is of primary if not determinative importance. It is difficult to imagine more sophisticated consumers, and a more prudent procurement process, than exists in the nuclear power business. In this context, adopting the point of view of the \"somewhat hurried\" consumer, as urged by AECL, does not make sense as there is no such thing as a \"hurried consumer\" of nuclear products and services. On the evidence before the Court, it can be determined at this stage that it is beyond the realm of possibility that any utility could be confused by the resemblance of the AREVA and AECL marks into purchasing a reactor from the \"wrong\" company (as indeed AECL's witnesses and its counsel admitted), or services from the \"wrong\" company. The lengthy and detailed procurement process that is involved in purchasing the wares and services of these parties makes that quite simply impossible."], ["[25]", "AECL's witness William Bohlke describes in detail the many steps taken in the procurement process in this industry when purchasing a reactor, refurbishment of an existing reactor or awarding a maintenance contract. He describes these steps for each of the following stages of the procurement process: project identification, forming a selection committee, pre-bid steps, evaluation of proposals including phase II - quantitative assessment and phase II - qualitative assessment, proposal clarification process, establishing an overall ranking, and awarding the contract. Accordingly, this is a case where there is no evidence that has been or could possibly be adduced at trial that would change the fact that any passing confusion that may arise from the resemblance of the trade-marks will always and in every case be dispelled through procurement processes before nuclear wares or services are actually purchased."], ["[26]", "That said, Mr. Bohlke's evidence raises an issue of confusion outside the procurement process. He challenges the assertion of AREVA's affiant that even if there were some initial confusion \"it is inconceivable that such a customer could or would continue to be confused once the procurement process started ...\" Mr. Bohlke affirms that a logo is associated with a vendor's reputation. He writes:", "[The] overall experience with a vendor is shaped not just by direct contact, but also be seemingly incidental occurrences. Often the color of, or logo on, a hard hat may be the \"identity\" of the individual(s) observed in some unsanctioned behaviour. Similarly, the customer will recognize the presence of a contractor in the field by the logo or trade-mark on its field trailers or offices. Finally, some pieces of equipment are branded, and the performance (or lack of performance) of the piece of equipment can contribute to the overall opinion formed by the utility of the vendor in question.", "In other words, there is goodwill in marks and there may be confusion by those in the nuclear industry aside from the procurement process. The suggestion of this witness is that a Canadian customer of nuclear wares and services could see the AREVA A Design Mark on say, an engineer's hard hat, and \"wrongly\" transfer to AECL whatever positive or negative associations he has made. This would then permeate his perception of the brand, which may ultimately influence relationships with vendors in subtle ways."], ["[27]", "AREVA's evidence does not speak to this type of confusion or subtle influence on consumer behaviour; however, when considering confusion of the two marks, regard must be had to the overall presentation used by the parties with respect to their marks:", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)."], ["[28]", "AREVA's A Design Mark is used in the first and last letter of the name AREVA.

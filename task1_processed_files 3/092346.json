The President of A&R, Mr. Randy Rotchin, was blunt enough to admit that there is no market for textile scrap and waste, and that in the course of the last five to seven years, it was not economically feasible to sell the textile scrap and waste for which it claims a drawback (Transcript of Randy Rothin's examination on affidavit, pages 53 and 56 of the Applicant Record). The best price the applicant was able to get for its leftover textile cuttings was $0.05/pound or $4.00 for the 80 pounds of scrap and waste for which it claims a drawback.

They cannot be assimilated to the \"goods\" referred to in ss. 109 and 110. Had Parliament intended to apply a refund for \"obsolete or surplus goods\" to scrap and waste, it would have used those words specifically. Indeed, Parliament was well aware of the distinction and enacted a specific regime for by-products, scrap and waste in ss. 120 to 122 of the", "Act"], ["[37]", "Section 122 is particularly interesting as it deals specifically with scrap and waste. Paragraph 89(1)(b) provides a relief of customs duty paid on imported goods processed in Canada and subsequently exported. Scrap or waste resulting from a processing operation is also eligible for relief under this program when the processed goods are exported. However, paragraph 122(1) provides that if the scrap or waste is merchantable and would be dutiable if imported, it is not entitled to the relief unless the scrap is exported. The rate of duty to use is that which applies to similar scrap, if it was being imported. In other words, any importer who imports dutiable materials into Canada that undergo a process resulting in scrap and waste does not receive a relief of 100% of the customs duties paid in respect of the imported material unless 100% of the imported material is exported. Any imported material and any scrap and waste derived from the processing of that material in Canada that remains in Canada is subject to the applicable Customs duties if it is merchantable."], ["[38]", "The same reasoning applies to goods in respect of which an application was made under s. 110 or 113. Whether the drawback or refund is claimed because the goods are surplus or obsolete (s. 110), or because duties were paid on goods for which relief could have been granted under s. 89 (s. 113), it is clear that the amount of the drawback or the refund will have to be reduced by the amount of duty that would be applicable to the sales value of the scrap resulting from a processing operation.

The same is true if the manufacturer decides not to market some or all of the dresses made from the textile bolt. Paragraph 110(b) of the", "Act", "would entitle him to a drawback since the dresses would be obsolete or surplus good (assuming, of course, that the other requirement of s. 109 are met).

Since the first portal through which a potential claimant for drawback must pass is that the surplus goods in respect of which the drawback claim is made must first be \"goods\", the above quoted phrase would be redundant, so the argument goes, since merchantable scrap or waste could never qualify for a drawback."], ["[43]", "As ingenious as it is, this reasoning cannot hold sway. The situation contemplated by that subsection is completely different from that of the applicant in the present case. The merchantable scrap to which s. 122(3) refers would be the leftover textile cuttings that would come into existence as a result of the processing of the textile bolt or dresses for which a refund has already been sought pursuant to s. 110. The intention behind s. 122(3) is to ensure that the drawback claimed for obsolete or surplus goods will be reduced by the amount of custom duties that would have to be paid on the merchantable scrap resulting from the processing of the obsolete or surplus goods.

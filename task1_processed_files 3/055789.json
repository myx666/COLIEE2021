After the fire, Mr. Elezi tried to reconstruct the files so people who had their property stolen could be compensated. But in December 1997, men came to his office and threatened to kill him.

Those threats were focused on Mr. Elezi, as his sister had emigrated to the U.S. by that time. Socialist Party supporters continually pressured Mr. Elezi's father to help them \"win\" the election.

It concluded he did not actually work for the Commission, because he could not tell the Board when it had been created, and by which political party. The Board also found he was not a Convention refugee because he lacked subjective fear: he had waited six months to leave after having been attacked, he had transited through several countries where he could have claimed refugee status before arriving in Canada, and he had returned to the same city each time he came back to Albania after trying to flee.

These include a dentist's note, confirming he had treated Mr. Elezi at home the night of September 2003, and documents from Mr. Elezi's work with the Commission to prove that he had indeed worked there. The PRRA officer similarly disregarded an article about Emir Dobjani, the Albanian ombudsman.

First, the letters appear to have been written after the Board's decision. They were notarized after the Board's decision, and the date on the envelopes in which they were sent also postdates the Board's decision. More importantly, however, I think the officer should have admitted the undated letters because they contain information that goes beyond a mere repetition of what was already in front of the Board. Unlike country condition reports and other documentary evidence of a general nature, the six letters that were excluded all directly relate to Mr. Elezi. The letters from his friends are first-hand witness accounts that corroborate his story.

In the latter decision, Justice Mosley went out of his way to distinguish the case before him from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , opining that the new evidence in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was \"central to the applicant's claim as it went to the very heart of the Board's conclusion that he would not be at risk as a HIV-positive gay man in Mexico\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 18).

The dentist's letter even notes that Mr. Elezi insisted on being treated at his home - which supports his submissions about subjective fear. As for the documents emanating from the Commission, they all bear his name and confirm that he did work for the Commission.

After all, the Board's hearing took place only three months after he arrived in Canada, and it does not require a stretch of the imagination to consider that this is not much time to gather that kind of evidence. The same applies, obviously, to the letters coming from the Mayor and the Deputy, if they were to be considered as evidence that arose before the Board's decision.

Even though he might be at fault for not providing some of the excluded evidence earlier, this should not excuse a PRRA officer from using his discretion to consider such critical, direct evidence. That evidence goes to the very heart of the Board's conclusion, and certainly tends to confirm not only Mr. Elezi's story but also the risk he would be facing were he to be returned to Albania."], ["[45]", "If Canada is to respect its international obligations and abide by its", "Charter of Rights and Freedoms", ", it cannot disregard credible evidence that a person would be at risk if sent back to his or her country of origin on the sole basis that this evidence is technically inadmissible.

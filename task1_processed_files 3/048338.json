By letter dated July 6, 1999, Mr. Mohamed's agent was advised that Mr. Mohamed's application was being assessed by the department's case management branch at national headquarters and that it was anticipated that the security review in the case would require a further period of six months to one year to process."], ["[7]", "On September 23, 1999, as a result of the internal review of Mr. Mohamed's file it was recommended that Mr. Mohamed be interviewed by an immigration officer.

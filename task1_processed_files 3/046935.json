Nevertheless, I also must consider relevant case law that has characterized these types of decisions as \"purely administrative\"."], ["[50]", "The nature of analogous decisions under the former", "Act", "was considered by the Federal Court of Appeal in that case of", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).

Under s. 27(3) of the former", "Act", ", the referral decision of the Deputy Minister is very similar to the referral decision of the Minister's delegate under s. 44(2). The conclusion of the Federal Court of Appeal was that he did not have such a right."], ["[52]", "Although the facts of", "Kindler", "involved a person with no legal status in Canada, rather than a permanent resident, I believe that the reasoning in that case remains applicable to the provisions of the", "IRPA", "and to the facts before me. In considering the nature of the decisions in question, Justice MacGuigan stated, at para. 9:", "\"... Whether it is the decision of the Deputy Minister under s. 27(3) to issue a direction for an inquiry to a senior immigration officer, or the subsequent decision of a senior immigration officer under s. 27(4) to cause that inquiry to be held, or the parallel decision such an officer under s. 28 to cause an inquiry to be held, it is, I believe, a purely administrative decision. The senior immigration officer does not even have to reflect on the question; he is merely a conduit through whom the inquiry is caused by operation of the", "Act", "The Deputy Minister has only to decide that an inquiry is warranted, which he could do on the existence of a prima facie case. His decision is analogous to that of any prosecutor who decides to proceed with a charge before the courts.", "\" (Emphasis added)", "In his conclusions, Justice MacGuigan considered all of the decisions made prior to the inquiry itself to be \"purely administrative\"."], ["[53]", "In the inquiry, as here, the possible outcomes of the inquiry were limited. At para. 15, Justice MacGuigan stated:", "\"It is true that the sole question in issue before the immigration adjudicator at the inquiry would be whether the factual allegations against the respondent are true. If they are, the result, deportation, must follow, since s. 32(6) of the", "Act", "precludes the adjudicator from considering special circumstances in determining whether to issue a deportation order in a case such as this. But in that respect the adjudicator is no different from many other triers of fact - the judge in a murder case, for example, who has no option as to imposing the penalty of life imprisonment if the facts are proved. What the adjudicator must do is scrupulously observe fairness in making his decision on the facts.\""], ["[54]", "Thus, even though the provisions have been amended and the final step of an appeal to the IAD removed, the analogies of the case before me to", "Kindler", "are evident. Under the current framework, all steps move towards an admissibility hearing, just as they did under the former", "Act", ". The outcome of this analysis and the applicability of", "Kindler", "is that the level of procedural fairness falls at the low end of the spectrum."], ["[55]", "The Applicant draws the Court's attention to the decision of", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 258 F.T.R. 54 (F.C.), and submits that the reasoning of Cha, is inconsistent with the reasoning in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .

Realistically speaking, it would be rare for someone convicted of serious criminality to complete the Division 4 procedure without receiving a removal order. Thus, the Officer's Report and the s. 44(2) Referral are, most often, determinative of the issue of whether the Applicant is to be issued a removal order. Further, without a statutory right of appeal to the IAD, the Applicant is unable to have a further consideration of the inadmissibility determination."], ["[59]", "It would be, however, artificial to consider the Admissibility Division in isolation from the rest of the", "IRPA", ", as it relates to the Applicant. As was recognized by my colleagues in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Applicant had the right to make an application to the Minister for an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate (\"H & C\") grounds (s. 25). He could have availed himself of a pre-removal risk assessment (s. 112). Under both of these processes, the Applicant would been permitted to make submissions that would have been taken into account by the decision makers. None of the Officer's Report, the s. 44(2) Referral or the removal order is the end of all possibilities for the Applicant to remain in Canada. Viewing the statute as a whole, the decisions at issue in this proceeding are not necessarily determinative of whether the Applicant will be removed from Canada."], ["[60]", "Accordingly, considering the rights of the Applicant under s. 25 and s. 112, the nature of the statutory scheme ensures that the Applicant need not be removed without consideration of H & C and risk factors. This favours a lower duty of procedural fairness.", "Importance of the Decision to the Applicant"], ["[61]", "There can be no question that the decisions of the immigration officer to prepare a report and of the Minister's delegate to refer that report to the Immigration Division are important to the Applicant. As discussed, the outcome will be a removal order with no right of appeal to the IAD. The Applicant points out that for someone in his position, who comes to Canada as a child and has been here for a long time, the decision has extreme importance. However, as noted above, the Applicant had access to two other procedures where H & C factors and possibility of risk upon his return to the Philippines could have been considered.", "Legitimate Expectations of the Individual Challenging the Decision"], ["[62]", "The fourth factor in the Baker analysis is the legitimate expectation of the person challenging the decision. As stated at para. 26 of", "Baker", ", \"if the claimant has a legitimate expectation that a certain procedure will be followed, this procedure will be required by the duty of fairness\". Further, the circumstances affecting procedural fairness take into account the promises or \"regular practices\" of the decision makers. Finally, Justice L'Heureux-Dubé commented that \"it will generally be unfair for them to act in contravention of representations as to procedure.\""], ["[63]", "In", "Baker", ", in examining this factor in the context of an immigration officer's decision on an H & C application, the argument before the Supreme Court was that the duty was heightened by the articles of an international convention. The Court rejected this argument."], ["[64]", "However, under both this factor and the fifth factor, the procedures set out in the Manual are relevant. Paragraph 8.7, ENF 5 of the Manual states that in making a s. 44(1) report against a permanent resident:", "\"[A]ll persons who are or may be subject to a report are to be informed of the criteria against which their case is being assessed and the possible outcome of the review (including the possibility of loss of appeal rights in A64 cases ...). They should also be given the opportunity to provide information. This can be done by way of in-person interview or in writing. For submissions in writing, sufficient time should be allowed for receipt by way of regular mail ...\""], ["[65]", "Paragraph 12.3 provides that:", "\"... an officer who writes a report must also provide a copy of that report to the person concerned ...

This appears to set the bar for the duty of fairness at something more than merely acting in good faith, as the Court in", "Kindler", "determined. This is not unreasonable now that the Supreme Court, in", "Baker", ", has given us more guidance on the matter of procedural fairness.", "Choice of Procedures by CIC"], ["[68]", "Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, at para. 27 of", "Baker", ", stated that this analysis should \"take into account and respect\" the choice of procedures made by the agency itself. She continued by stating that, while this was not determinative, \"important weight must be given to the choice of procedures made by the agency itself\"."], ["[69]", "In this case, CIC has adopted the procedures described above.", "Baker", "teaches us that weight should be given to these choices.", "Application to s. 44(1) and 44(2) Decisions"], ["[70]", "Balancing all of these factors, I find that they point toward a more relaxed duty of fairness, similar to that found by the Supreme Court in", "Baker", ". In my view, the duty of fairness implicitly adopted by CIC for purposes of the s. 44(1) report is appropriate. Although these are administrative decisions (rather than quasi-judicial) and although the person affected has some other rights to seek to remain in Canada, these are serious decisions affecting his rights. CIC, whose choice of procedures should be respected, has elected to give the affected person a right to make submissions, either orally or in writing and to obtain a copy of the report. Having a copy of the report would allow the affected person to decide whether he wishes to seek judicial review of the immigration officer's report to this Court. This, I conclude is the duty of fairness owed the Applicant and others in his position with respect to the Officer's Report."], ["[71]", "Implicit in this duty is, in my view, a requirement that the person being interviewed by an immigration officer is informed of the purpose of that interview so that he may make meaningful submissions. Further, I would think that the duty of fairness would require the immigration officer put to the interviewee any information he has that the interviewee would not reasonably be expected to have. A further implication is that the person should be offered the opportunity to have counsel present at any interview or to assist him in preparing written submissions. All of this is part of what CIC has acknowledged is required for the person to \"fully understand both the case against them and the nature and purpose of the report\"."], ["[72]", "Given my conclusion that the duty of fairness is \"relaxed\", there are a number of procedures that are not essential. As was concluded in", "Baker", ", I would agree that an oral interview by the immigration officer is not always required, as long as the affected person is given an opportunity to make submissions and to know the case against him. Nor do I believe that the duty requires that the Officer's Report be put to the Applicant for a further opportunity to respond prior to the s. 44(2) Referral.

He states that, while he was told he could have counsel for an inquiry, he was not advised on whether he could have counsel represent him on the issue of whether his case should be referred to an inquiry. The Applicant acknowledges that he was asked questions.

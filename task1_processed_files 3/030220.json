The penis contains two symmetrical compartments above and on either side of the urethra each of which is called a corpus cavernosum. They consist of small blood vessels or passages surrounded by smooth muscle which can contract or relax as with any form of muscle. Blood is supplied to the corpora cavernosa by a network of arteries and it is drained from them through veins. When flaccid, the flow of blood into the corpora is restrained by contraction of the smooth muscle surrounding the arterial network. The penis becomes erect when the penile smooth muscle relaxes and blood flows through the arterial network and into the small blood vessels or sinusoids. The resulting swelling squeezes the veins thus reducing their drainage capacity."], ["[13]", "Full erection is achieved when the pressure in the corpora cavernosa equals the pressure of the blood leaving the heart. Detumescence results when the smooth muscles contract, the arteries are again restricted and pressure on the veins relaxed allowing for the outflow of blood. Abnormal vascular responsiveness is the underlying cause of impotence in the majority of sufferers and the most common cause is the failure to retain blood within the sinusoids."], ["[14]", "Penile smooth muscle is \"told what to do\" by a complex biochemical system involving chemical messengers operating on communication systems called", "pathways", "in the evidence. The term is used to describe a chain of related events in a signal transmission extending from the source of the signal to a cell and continuing within the cell through the various steps that are triggered to change the cell. The NO-cGMP pathway in particular plays a central role in the mechanism of penile erection and defects in this pathway can lead to impotence and underlie certain diseases that cause ED."], ["[15]", "In the NO-CGMP pathway, a \"first messenger\" (nitric oxide) relays a message to the inside of the smooth muscle cells, activating receptors to stimulate the production of a \"second messenger\" (cGMP or cyclic3c,5c,-guanosine monophosphate). Nitric oxide (NO) is produced or released from two sources: endothelium cells in the lining of the smooth muscle and nerves in the smooth muscle known as non-adrenergic non-cholinergic or NANC nerves. Accordingly, this route is referred to as the NANC pathway. NO is produced by a reaction from a chemical called L-arginine catalyzed by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. This was often referred to in the evidence as the \"front end\" of the process."], ["[16]", "The production of cGMP sets off a chain of events that leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle in the penis. This allows more blood to enter causing an increase in pressure which restricts blood outflow, the resulting effect being an erection. In brief, production of cGMP contributes to tumescence and its removal leads to detumescence. Another chemical agent which relaxes smooth muscle is cyclic adenosine monophosphate or cAMP, produced by other material in response to different chemical messengers."], ["[17]", "The physiological effects of cGMP and cAMP may be reduced by PDE (phosphodiesterases) enzymes, which break down (hydrolyze) cGMP and cAMP by binding to the molecules. By June 1993, it was known that there were five PDEs and that some of them could be inhibited or blocked by other chemicals called PDE inhibitors. By inhibiting a PDE, one can stop the degradation of cGMP or cAMP. Inhibiters are selective in that they preferentially hydrolyze a particular enzyme, for example PDE5 is a selective cGMP PDE in that it prefers to hydrolyze cGMP over other enzymes.

All of the literature left open the cause of erectile dysfunction. Was it caused by impairment of the NANC pathway or some other pathway? If it was the NANC pathway, where did the impairment lie?

Indeed, he says, many remained skeptical even after publication of the Pfizer results. The focus was on intracavernous drug injections and other therapies. It was counterintuitive and surprising that a PDE5 inhibitor administered orally could have a localized effect.

In reviewing their possible use as drug therapy for humans, one of the several potential uses he identifies is impotence. He notes that zaprinast was the most frequently studied PDE5 inhibitor and much of his commentary is based on the reported effects of that compound. But Murray never suggests that zaprinast be considered as a candidate for treatment of ED. One of the compounds he describes had been developed by his own company but there is no indication of any intent to explore any potential use of that compound in relation to ED. He states that the therapeutic potential would become clearer when other \"rationally designed PDE5 inhibitors become available\". In Dr. Brock's view, with which I agree, this was all \"blue sky\" thinking."], ["[105]", "None of the PDE inhibitors Dr. Murray listed had any established clinical utility in treating ED. Zaprinast had been developed for treating asthma. Based on Dr. Murray's review, zaprinast should have been a candidate for clinical testing in human ED. As Dr. Heaton noted, this was not done because, amongst other things, zaprinast lowers blood pressure, as Dr. Murray pointed out. This side effect was the expected disadvantage of any PDE5 inhibitor. There would be concerns about the effects on other body systems. At best, the Murray article can be taken to suggest that there is a possibility that cGMP PDE5 inhibitors could be developed for ED, subject to human testing. In any event, Dr. Murray points to the potential utility of zaprinast, not sildenafil."], ["[106]", "According to Dr. de Tejada, on cross-examination in reference to Dr. Murray's comments about therapeutic potential and speaking of zaprinast: \"[o]bviously, I mean there is a development that has to occur ... It is obvious it should be tried.\" But try what? Zaprinast? Murray does not point to trying sildenafil but even if he did, the test for obviousness in Canadian law, being mindful that one should not rely on catchphrases as legal standards, is not whether something should be tried or is \"worth a try\":", "Eli  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 301.", "Bush:"], ["[107]", "As noted above, Dr. Peggy Bush was a member of the Ignarro team at U.C.L.A. during the relevant period.

The respondent's experts, Drs. de Tejada, Corbin and Maurice, conceded on cross-examination that they first became aware of the thesis when it was provided to them by counsel for Apotex.

The objective of this research was to determine whether the L.arginine-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway is involved in NANC stimulated relaxation of the corpus cavernosum, and to elucidate the mechanism of relaxation. The conclusions she expressed as resulting directly from those experiments were, as Dr. de Tejada put it, \"relatively narrow\" and very similar to those reported by the same group in the Rajfer and Trigo-Rocha papers on which she had also worked. However, Dr. Bush was able to take a wider view in the summary and conclusions section of her thesis. In that section, among other things, she stated the following:", "\"The results of this research are probably most important in terms of practical application to the treatment of urological disorders such as impotence and priapism. Now that the physiological mechanism for corporal smooth muscle relaxation has been established, this mechanism can be used as a framework", "to systematically study", "the problem of impotence. The geology of the vasculogenic and\\or neurogenic importance", "may be linked", "to a defect somewhere in the L.arginine nitric oxide cyclic GMP pathway ... Clinical development of a specific cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor", "should be considered", "for the treatment of impotence. A specific cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor", "could enhance", "corporal smooth muscle relaxation and produce erection by inhibiting the breakdown of cyclic GMP, thus having a direct and specific effect on the L-arginine-nitric oxide-cyclic GMP mediated relaxation process. Agents that are currently being used to treat impotence, the mechanisms of which do not appear to have the physiological basis, should probably be reevaluated, and less efficacy has been clearly established. A number of", "interesting directions for future research", "can be identified. ... Elucidation of the mechanism of relaxation and corpus cavernosum will set the", "groundwork for future studies", "of the mechanism of erection as well as the etiology and treatment of impotence.\" (Emphasis added)"], ["[121]", "In Dr. Brock's opinion, when a skilled person read this passage in context, he would not have understood that a specific cyclic GMP PDE inhibitor would successfully treat erectile dysfunction. It was a possibility to be considered and further researched, which is consistent with the views of the other experts at the time such as Rajfer and Trigo-Rocha."], ["[122]", "For Dr. Heaton, the Bush thesis showed just how much remained unknown that could be the subject of future research projects. It was not a given that a cGMP PDE inhibitor would be clinically effective as a treatment for ED and there is no suggestion in the thesis that such a drug could be administered orally. On cross examination, Dr. Corbin agreed with the suggestion that what Dr. Bush was saying is that understanding the mechanism for relaxation will establish a basis for future research into not only the mechanism of erection but also for treatment of impotence. But that does not, in my view, point directly to the invention claimed by the '446 patent.", "Conclusion on Obviousness:"], ["[123]", "Keeping in mind the strict nature of the obviousness test, and the fact that there is much which is common in the evidence of all of the experts; what emerges is a picture of a field of rapidly advancing science which led to the discovery but which did not point directly to it. It is clear that quite a number of significant factors were known at the priority date, but this is to be expected. Seldom will an invention come out of the blue; usually it will be based on a body of work and incremental progress."], ["[124]", "As submitted by the applicants, in 1993 there were several biochemical pathways under study and several first and second messengers disclosed. A few scientists speculated that PDE inhibition might be a factor in erectile tissue physiology. None of them, however, arrived at the solution of using oral administration of sildenafil as a PDE5 inhibitor in the treatment of ED prior to Pfizer."], ["[125]", "Although there was a significant amount of evidence indicating that cGMP PDE inhibitors should be further explored with regards to the treatment of ED in the months leading up to the Pfizer discovery, the evidence does not in my view establish that the solution taught by the patent was obvious at the time. At best there was speculation, which in hindsight proved to be correct, that PDE5 inhibitors might treat impotence. Experiments with zaprinast, a cGMP PDE inhibitor, had been performed but in an effort to understand how the erectile process works, not how to treat ED."], ["[126]", "Even if the person of ordinary skill had arrived, based on the art, at oral administration of sildenafil, and being mindful of the caution stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above about the use of catchphrases, the most that could have been said at the priority date is that it would be \"worth a try\". Indeed that is essentially how Dr. Ringrose characterized his view when he suggested that sildenafil be tried out as a treatment for impotence by the Urogenitals Group  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in January, 1992. As we know from the evidence, the initial tests with monkeys were unsuccessful but subsequent testing in human volunteers produced reports of spontaneous erections. Those reports, internal to Pfizer, were not available to the ordinary skilled person. The result was, as the applicants say, part luck and part deductive science."], ["[127]", "While it was surprising to many working in the field at the time that the oral administration of a PDE5 inhibitor would work, without serious side effects, the evidence is clear that there was a strong motivation to come up with a convenient drug treatment for ED. Textbooks and articles published in the 1990's and tendered in evidence contain statements such as \"[e]very urologist has been asked at some point by a patient suffering from erectile dysfunction whether he could just get a 'pill' to fix the problem\". As Dr. Rajfer wrote in a June 1998 editorial in the Journal of Urology: \"The development of an oral pill for impotence has been the dream of many researchers in the field, myself included.\" That this was the \"Holy Grail\" of such research is not surprising given the estimates that many millions of men suffer from the condition. The result of the discovery of sildenafil's effects was a profound change in treatment methods, as the experts acknowledged."], ["[128]", "The cumulative effect of secondary indicia such as the commercial success of the product, its wide use, and the surprise that accompanied its first publication further support my conclusion. As noted in the", "British Medical Journal", "of September 19, 1998:", "\"The popular interest in Viagra (sildenafil) is not solely the result of media hype and the drug's association with sex: the demand for treatment has been enormous.

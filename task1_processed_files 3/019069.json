Her daughter Leyla Apithy, a citizen of the United States, is the other applicant. The principal applicant is a Muslim. She fears her family because they allegedly tried to force her into a marriage and because of the fact that she had a Christian boyfriend. In 2002, the applicant followed her boyfriend to the U.S. While in the U.S. the applicant became pregnant. Shortly thereafter the applicant and her boyfriend began having problems and the applicant moved alone to Chicago where she gave birth to her daughter. Several months after the birth, the applicant left with her daughter for Benin. She alleged that while in Benin her mother threatened to poison her and her daughter. As a result of this incident the applicants returned to the U.S. They arrived in Canada from the United States on January 6, 2004 and claimed refugee status upon arrival. In a decision dated October 7, 2004, the Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the \"Refugee Board\") denied the applicants' claim on the grounds that the principal applicant was not credible and had no subjective fear."], ["[3]", "The applicants made a motion for a stay of removal but this motion was refused on January 31, 2007 by Mr. Justice Shore.

She noted that the applicant had provided no evidence to support these allegations. The Officer noted that the documentary evidence indicates that there is a law which prohibits female genital mutilation but that in practice the government has not succeeded in completing eradicating the practice. According to the documentary evidence approximately 17% of women in Benin have been subjected to female genital mutilation and that 70% of women from the Bariba, Yoa-Lokpa and Peul ethnic groups are subjected to it.

Secondly, where the immigration officer intends to rely on evidence which is not normally found, or was not available at the time the applicant filed his submissions, in documentation centres, fairness dictates that the applicant be informed of any novel and significant information which evidences a change in the general country conditions that may affect the disposition of the case.", "23 To reach that conclusion, which in my view is the correct one, regard has been given, as mandated by the caselaw, to a) the nature of the proceeding and the rules under which the decision-maker is acting, b) the context of the proceeding and c) the nature of the documents at issue in such proceedings.", ". . . . .", "27 I would therefore answer the certified question as follows, it being understood that each case will have to be decided according to its own circumstances and it being assumed that the documents at issue in a given case are of a nature such as that described above:", "a) with respect to documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions which were available and accessible at Documentation Centres at the time submissions were made by an applicant, fairness does not require the Post Claims Determination Officer to disclose them in advance of determining the matter;", "b) with respect to documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions which became available and accessible after the filing of an applicant's submissions, fairness requires disclosure by the Post Claims Determination Officer where they are novel and significant and where they evidence changes in the general country conditions that may affect the decision."], ["[13]", "In the present case, none of the documents were available at the IRB Documentation Centres although a document produced by WiLDAF/FeDDAF is listed on the Exhibits List of the Benin Kit available at the IRB Documentation Centre and I find that information on this organization's website was available to the applicants (Affidavit of Jordan Topp, applicants' record at page 36).

An additional problem is that the parties do not appear to even agree on the date of the applicants' latest submissions.

In my view, none of these cases are similar to the present case where the Officer relied on documents taken from websites which are not generally consulted in immigration decisions. Therefore, where an immigration officer relies on a document from a non-standard site, i.e. a site not regularly cited in the IRB National Documentation Packages such as Amnesty International or the U.S. Department of State, there is a duty to disclose these documents to the applicant", "provided that they are novel and significant and that they evidence changes in country conditions that may affect the decision", ". In other words, where a document is taken from a non-standard website and is not available at the IRB Documentation Centre then the question of whether the document was available before the latest submissions of the applicants is not relevant.

The Inter Press Services Agency article indicates that attitudes towards female genital mutilation are changing. This same information is contained within the 2005 U.S. Department of State Report and the IRB Response to Request for Information, BEN41835.F, both of which were available to the applicants through IRB Documentation Centres. The final document is from the Benin Development Gateway Site and contains general information about the health care situation in Benin. The information is not relevant to any of the issues addressed in the PRRA and nowhere in her decision did the Officer refer specifically to this document. I suspect it was unintentionally included because the Officer considered it in her assessment of the applicants' H&C application an application which was done at the same time as the PRRA file.

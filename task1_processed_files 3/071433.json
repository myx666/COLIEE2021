He alleged having a well-founded fear of persecution for two reasons. First, the applicant alleged that he faced persecution by unidentified persons in the Ivory Coast on the grounds of membership in a particular social group, namely as a foreigner. The applicant also claimed to fear persecution by the Chonbulu people in Ghana, due to his membership in the Hausa tribe.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "The applicant's father was a citizen of the Ivory Coast and his mother was from Ghana. The applicant and his family lived in Napie, Ivory Coast, until his parents divorced in 1983. At the age of seven, the applicant went to live in Ghana with his mother. His father continued to live in Napie and later remarried.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "In the narrative section of his personal information form (PIF), the applicant stated that in 2000 he joined his father in the Ivory Coast for a few days, and then returned to Ghana. In October 2004, the applicant went to the Ivory Coast in order to live with his father. His father was ninety years old when he and his wife were killed by unidentified persons in November 2004. The applicant stated that his father was killed because he was perceived by locals as a foreigner. The applicant stated that he immediately fled the Ivory Coast since he was also perceived as a foreigner and feared for his life.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "The applicant returned to Kwame Danso, Ghana and stated that he had problems with the Chonbulu people while living in there. The applicant explained that he was a member of the Hausa tribe and that the Chonbulu constitute the majority of the population in Kwame Danso. The applicant stated that the Chonbulu treated the Hausa badly and that he feared being killed by them because of his brother's activism. The applicant claimed that the Chonbulu came to his house seeking to kill his family but that they escaped. The applicant stated that the Ghanaian police support the Chonbulu and would not protect him.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The applicant claimed refugee protection when he arrived in Toronto on December 19, 2004. The applicant's refugee claim was heard on August 5, 2005. By decision dated September 30, 2005, the Board rejected the applicant's claim on the basis that there was no objective basis established by the documentary evidence to support the applicant's claim of having a well-founded fear of persecution. The Board also found that there was insufficient evidence that the applicant would be subjected to a danger of torture, risk to his life or cruel and unusual treatment if returned to the Ivory Coast. The Board held that the applicant was thus neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. This is the judicial review of the Board's decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Reasons for the Board's Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The Board first noted the applicant's family background. The Board was satisfied as to the claimant's identity and found that he was both a citizen of the Ivory Coast and a habitual resident of Ghana. The Board found that the primary issue to be resolved was the objective basis of the applicant's fear of returning to the Ivory Coast and its related credibility concerns.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The Board did not find it credible that the applicant's father would have been considered a foreigner by his fellow citizens and targeted for that reason. The Board found it implausible that the applicant's father was treated as a foreigner for having married a Ghanaian national since he and his first wife had lived in the Ivory Coast for eight years without a problem. The applicant's father later remarried a woman from the Ivory Coast, and the Board inferred that their community would not have regarded them as foreigners. The Board concluded that since the locals had not subjected the applicant's father to prejudice during his life, they would not have killed him in his ninetieth year. The panel accepted that the applicant's father died in November 2004 but rejected the manner of death as lacking credibility.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "The Board noted that the applicant had not submitted objective evidence showing that people in situations similar to that of his father were treated badly due to their perception as foreigners. The Board noted that the applicant could have obtained information about his father's treatment from Baba; a friend of his father's who still resided in Napie. The Board surmised that it was reasonable that Baba would be aware of any prejudicial treatment of the applicant's father.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "The applicant spent a few days in the Ivory Coast with his father in 2000 but did not testify that he had encountered any problems there, only that he felt conspicuous as a foreigner due to his limited ability to speak the country's main languages. The Board inferred that the applicant's return to Ghana was a personal choice motivated by the advantage of having greater control over his circumstances. The Board found that following his return to the Ivory Coast in October 2004, the applicant had not experienced prejudicial treatment from the community that would indicate that people perceived him as an outsider. There was evidence that the applicant was assisted by Baba in opening his tailor shop and had a professional card which described him as a tailor domiciled in Napie.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "The Board found it unreasonable that the applicant had not determined who killed his father and therefore did not accept evidence related to his death as credible. The Board found the applicant's inability to identify the feared agents of persecution to be consistent with the absence of documented reports of foreigners being targeted in the Ivory Coast. The Board drew a negative credibility inference from the lack of identification of the agents of persecution. In addition, the Board did not find any objective evidence that supported the applicant's fear of being mistreated as a foreigner.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[13]", "The Board also considered documentary evidence regarding the treatment of returned asylum seekers. The Board found that there was insufficient credible evidence to support a finding that the applicant would face a risk of serious harm if returned to the Ivory Coast. The Board also found insufficient evidence to show that the applicant would face torture, a risk to life, or cruel or unusual treatment if returned to the Ivory Coast and therefore held that he was not a person in need of protection. In view of its findings that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, and could thus be returned to his country of citizenship, the Board found it unnecessary to analyse the applicant's fear of return to Ghana.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[14]", "The parties submitted the following issues for consideration:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "1. Did the Board apply the wrong standard of proof when assessing the applicant's claim on section 96 and paragraph 97(1)(b) grounds?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "2.

It was submitted that the Board erred in finding that the applicant was not a Convention refugee because he would not face a \"substantial\" risk of persecution. The applicant cited", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> which stated that the proper test for determining Convention refugee status is whether there is a reasonable chance or good grounds that persecution will occur (see also", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). The applicant submitted that the Board also erred in law by requiring that the applicant show substantial grounds for his claim under paragraph 97(1)(b) of", "IRPA", ".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[16]", "The applicant submitted that the Board erred in determining that there was no evidence that foreigners living in the Ivory Coast were at risk. The applicant cited documentary evidence which indicated that security forces, native ethnic groups and pro-government forces have engaged in violence against immigrants. The applicant submitted that the evidence described the problems that are faced by persons perceived as non-Ivorian in the country. The applicant also noted that the United Nations Human Rights Agency has recommended against the return of Ivory Coast citizens.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "The applicant submitted that the Board erred in taking into account irrelevant considerations when it analyzed the applicant's case from the perspective of his father's situation. The applicant noted that while his father lived his entire life in Napie, the applicant does not speak French and has only lived in the Ivory Coast for brief periods since the age of seven. The applicant responded to the Board's finding that he had not experienced any problems while in the Ivory Coast by noting that his father was killed the last time he was there.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Respondent's Submissions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "The respondent submitted that the Board applied the correct burden of proof in assessing the applicant's claim under section 96 of", "IRPA", ". It was submitted that the test, as articulated in the phrase \"would face a substantial possibility of serious harm\", only required the applicant to show that there was a real chance that he would face persecution if returned to the Ivory Coast. The respondent acknowledged that the Court in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , rejected the \"would on substantial grounds\" threshold because it allowed ambiguity to exist as to the standard used. However, the respondent submitted there was no ambiguity in the case at hand, as the \"substantial possibility of serious harm\" formulation required the Board to assess whether the possibility of persecution was so strong that it qualified as a real possibility of persecution under the Convention refugee definition. The respondent cited", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), wherein it was found that the Convention refugee standard for risk of persecution requires something more than a minimal possibility but need not exceed a fifty percent chance.

The respondent submitted that there is a distinction between the \"substantial grounds\" term used  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "and the \"substantial possibility\" terminology used by the Board in this case. The applicant submitted that the combined use of the terms \"substantive\" and \"possibility\" suggests an examination of likelihood that is inherent in the balance of possibilities standard. The applicant submitted that it is well established that the standard of proof involved in paragraphs 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of", "IRPA", "is the balance of probabilities. The respondent submitted that so long as the \"substantial possibility\" threshold reflects the balance of probabilities standard, it may be used to assess claims under both paragraphs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[21]", "The respondent submitted that the Board did not ignore evidence regarding the targeting of foreigners in the Ivory Coast. In the alternative, the respondent submitted that had the Board ignored such evidence, no reviewable error was committed in doing so. The respondent submitted that the Board's assessment of the risk faced by foreigners was secondary to its finding that the applicant's father was not a foreigner. It was submitted that the Board's finding on the targeting of foreigners would therefore only be of consequence if the applicant and his father were considered foreigners. Since no finding was made in this regard, the respondent submitted that the error alleged by the applicant would be immaterial. The respondent submitted that it was open to the Board to find that there was no evidence of foreigners being targeted. It was submitted that the document relied upon by the applicant in challenging the finding was never before the Board and the Board therefore did not err in failing to consider it.

When he applied for refugee protection, he had just completed a period of training in Canada as a public servant in the Congolese ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation (Congolese ministry). He worked in the branch responsible for bilateral cooperation with Western countries and was a member of the Congolese diplomatic corps as a first secretary: notwithstanding the credibility issue, could the applicant's failure to return have been perceived by the authorities there as a blunt resignation of his diplomatic position, exposing him to danger today if he were to return to his country?"], ["[4]", "Of course, the credibility of the persecution story was at the heart of the claim and, accordingly, of the concerns of the member hearing the refugee claim.

This approval apparently took the secret service agents by surprise.

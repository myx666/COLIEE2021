Though medicines themselves can now be patented as products, clearly a large number of patents still exist in relation to medicines when prepared by a particular process. Accordingly, there are three types of claims which can be made in a medicine patent.

He held that a composite material could be a substance. If in the present case the sulphonyl urea or its salt is mixed with a liquid or solid carrier so that the mixture is in the form of a dilution or a tablet I do not see how it could reasonably be argued that the mixture is not a substance that is different from that of any of its ingredients. The same is true if the preparation consists of the sulphonyl urea and its salt and an orally ingestible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in the form of a capsule for it is the whole preparation in its composite form, and not separated into its ingredients, that is taken into the mouth for the purpose of reducing the blood sugar level. It is, therefore, erroneous to say that the substance of the antidiabetic preparation is confined to its sulphonyl urea ingredient or its salt. It is the pharmaceutical preparation as a whole that is intended for medicine and to be used for oral administration. Consequently, I find that the antidiabetic preparation defined in the claims is a substance within the meaning of s. 41(1).\""], ["[46]", "Thorson, P., went on to confirm that the claim was patentable. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the decision was reversed on the ground that the preparation was not the result of a creative invention. However, the Supreme Court specifically confirmed the reasoning and conclusion of Thorson, P., reflected by the above-quoted passage [see footnote 11]."], ["[47]", "Against this background, it seems clear that the words \"drug\" and \"medicine\" as they appear in s. 4(1) of the", "Regulations", "are not used in contradistinction and are not intended to draw a line between an active ingredient and a preparation or composition which includes an active ingredient. Both types of substances when capable or intended to be used for the treatment or prevention of a disease are a \"medicine\" within the meaning of the", "Regulations", "and a claim for the medicine itself, whether in the form of a single active ingredient or in the form of a composition comes within the ambit of the", "Regulations"], ["[48]", "As confirmed by the decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Governor-in-Council chose to exclude from the ambit of the protection afforded by the", "Regulations", "a patented \"process claim\". This was done in clear terms by limiting the claims protected under the", "Regulations", "to those which \"claim for the medicine itself\". A \"process claim\" makes no such claim. If it had also been intended to exclude pharmaceutical formulations, the Governor-in-Council would not have been so timid and ambivalent as to attempt this by the construction which Nu-Pharm suggests. Keeping in mind that the", "Regulations", "are intended to prevent infringements, and that the defined meaning of the word \"medicine\" is a substance or substances capable of therapeutic effect, I must conclude that a claim for such substance or substances in the form of a composition is \"a claim for the medicine itself\"."], ["[49]", "As the substance or substances claimed in each of patents 228, 963 and 048 are intended or capable of being used for the treatment of a disorder or disease, they are a \"medicine\" within the meaning of the", "Regulations", ", and as each patent includes a claim for such substance or substances, they make a \"claim for the medicine itself\". Furthermore, as patent 048 includes a claim for the use of substance or substances for treating inflammation of the nasal mucosa without inducing stinging, it also contains a claim for the \"use of the medicine\"."], ["[50]", "Finally, in the event that it later be found that only an original active ingredient is a \"medicine\" as Nu-Pharm contends, I find that the active substance Form A as claimed by the 228 patent is such an ingredient. The 228 patent includes claims to various polymorphic crystalline forms of flunisolide including the ideal hemydrate Form A Flunisolide when produced by processes particularly described in the patent. The inventive ingenuity of the patent is that Form A is purer [see footnote 12], that it has a uniform crystalline size with no propensity to clog spray dispensers, and that it does not cause stinging of the nasal mucosa. As such, Form A is an active ingredient distinct from flunisolide, and as patent 228 makes a claim to that ingredient itself, it makes a \"claim to the medicine itself\"."], ["[51]", "Based on the foregoing and as Nu-Pharm has advanced no evidence with respect to the composition or the process for making the drug for which it has sought an NOC, I must conclude insofar as patents 228, 048 and 963 are concerned that none of the allegations made by Nu-Pharm are justified.

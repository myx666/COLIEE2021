He says he is a homosexual and has had a emotional relationship with an inmate, Philippe Mayer, since some time in September 1997: the latter has shared the same cell as himself since September 1997. Because of the building regulations regarding single and double occupancy applicable in the institution, the applicant and his fellow inmate Mr. Mayer cannot have sexual relations except in a private family visit. Accordingly, in April 1998 the applicant made an application to participate in the private family visiting program so he would have the opportunity of having intimate relations with Mr. Mayer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "In May 1998 the applicant was told that his application to participate in the private family visiting program had been rejected: on May 6, 1998, he filed a first level grievance with the Drummond Institution head to challenge the rejection of his application.

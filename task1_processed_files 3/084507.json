The plaintiff, by application sought an order adding Michael MacFarlane as a defendant to the action and amending the statement of claim accordingly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[2]", "At the hearing of these matters, I issued two orders in which I granted the defendant's application and dismissed the application brought on behalf of the plaintiff.

F-7, as amended.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "The plaintiff is a fisherman residing in the Province of Newfoundland. On approximately May 22, 1992 he entered into a charterparty with Lawrence Ralph Lord for lease of the defendant motor vessel, the \"Tami Joan\", for the period from May 15, 1992 to December 25, 1992. He paid Mr. Lord $35,000 plus GST under the charterparty and was given possession of the vessel. At the time the plaintiff took possession, the vessel was subject to a mortgage held by the Fisheries Development Board of the Province of New Brunswick as mortgagee.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "While in possession of the vessel the plaintiff claims to have made various improvements and installed equipment. During the time the vessel was in his possession, the mortgage held against it went into default. On October 26, 1992 the defendant Her Majesty in right of the Province of New Brunswick as represented by the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture (the \"Minister\"), through authorized agents, took possession of the vessel and all equipment on it, at St. John's, Newfoundland.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a statement of claim on November 12, 1992 alleging that the Minister wrongfully took possession of the vessel without notice and in a high-handed manner, by calling the plaintiff to a meeting and taking possession of the vessel while he was in attendance at the meeting. In addition, the plaintiff submits that the Minister has failed to account for the improvements and equipment on the vessel which are owned by him. By the statement of claim the plaintiff seeks an order declaring that he is entitled to possession of the vessel, and that he is entitled to a possessory maritime lien in priority to all other claims against the defendant vessel, and he also claims damages, including special, general and punitive damages against the second defendant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "A first defendant, Mr. Lord, as owner of all 64 shares in the vessel, filed a statement of defence which claims that by the charterparty the plaintiff undertook to pay him a total of $75,000 plus GST, with $35,000 plus GST being paid upon delivery of the vessel and the balance paid in monthly instalments of $10,000 plus GST, commencing July 31, 1992 until the total amount due was paid. Mr. Lord claims that the charterparty also provided that the plaintiff is responsible for keeping the vessel in good repair and in the same condition in which it was received, and that the plaintiff is liable for all loss and damage to the vessel. In addition, it is said that the plaintiff had a duty to maintain insurance, and to pay solicitor and other costs in connection with repossession and collection of sums due by the plaintiff to Mr. Lord. Mr. Lord states that the plaintiff undertook to make the first payment under the charterparty, due July 31, 1992, directly to the mortgagee, but failed to do so, which resulted in seizure of the vessel. By statement of defence and counterclaim Mr. Lord claims the balance of amounts owing under the charterparty and possession of the vessel, as well as costs associated with insuring and returning the vessel, a possessory maritime lien and damages.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "The Minister filed a statement of defence and counterclaim on February 12, 1993 on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of New Brunswick as a First defendant, a person interested in the motor vessel \"Tami Joan\" by virtue of the mortgage held by the provincial Fisheries Development Board. In the defence it is explicitly stated that Her Majesty is defending the action only in her capacity as a first defendant, and only insofar as the action is one in rem against the vessel. The Minister, in the statement of defence and counterclaim, claims that under the terms of the mortgage, the mortgagor, or any person claiming under the mortgagor, is not permitted to land or sell fish outside of the Province of New Brunswick without the approval of the Minister, which the plaintiff did not here seek. The defence maintains the vessel \"Tami Joan\" was contacted by radio on May 24, 1992 through the Canadian Coast Guard, while she was at sea, and the vessel was requested to sail to the nearest port; persons on the vessel agreed, but failed to then follow the instruction and thereafter failed to respond to subsequent calls made on standard calling frequencies. The vessel was subsequently sailed to Newfoundland.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "In Her Majesty's statement of defence and counterclaim as a first defendant it is claimed that on June 4, 1992 the plaintiff was contacted by a representative of the Province of New Brunswick, Mr. MacFarlane, and advised of the mortgage held against the vessel and that the mortgage was then in default and the vessel was, as a result, liable to seizure. In the view of the Minister by October 26, 1992, the date of seizure, the plaintiff had constructively abandoned the vessel in that he had failed to pay insurance on the vessel, had tied up the vessel \"at the Port of St. John\" (presumably it was intended to say \"St. John's\" where the vessel was seized) for a prolonged period of time without payment of wharfage fees or port tariffs. Further, it is alleged the plaintiff had ceased making payments to Mr. Lord, had foregone an available fishery and had ceased to maintain and occupy the vessel.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The Minister alleges that the plaintiff was called to the vessel on October 26, 1992 and was invited to remove his personal belongings, which he declined to do, stating to Mr. MacFarlane, among others, that he had no more equipment on board. The Minister claims that he is willing to deliver the remainder of the plaintiff's belongings on request, but that most of the improvements alleged by the plaintiff to have been made could not be located on the vessel. In the counterclaim, which was subsequently withdrawn, the Minister claimed the expenses incurred in seizing and selling the vessel.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "On April 5, 1993 the plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to rule 324 seeking to add Mr. MacFarlane as a defendant to this action. By Order dated April 29, 1993 my colleague Mr. Justice Denault ordered that the application is not a matter that should be disposed of without personal appearance by the parties. Thereafter the plaintiff filed the application now before the court to add Mr. MacFarlane as a defendant. On March 6, 1996, the Minister filed the other application now before the court, to enter a conditional appearance to challenge the jurisdiction of the court in relation to the second defendant, Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Brunswick as represented by the Minister, and striking portions of the statement of claim. I deal with the latter application first in the balance of these Reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "On behalf of the Minister it is submitted that this court does not have jurisdiction over Her Majesty in right of a Province.

Rather, it is said, those documents were filed in her capacity as a first defendant, a mortgagee interested in the \"Tami Joan\", and were in response to the in rem proceedings initiated against the owners and all others interested in the vessel. The Minister specifically disputed the plaintiff's ability to bring the action in personam. Moreover, it is said, even if Her Majesty, or her Minister were considered to have submitted to the court's jurisdiction, the court would still not have jurisdiction under the", "Federal Court Act", "to determine a claim in personam against Her Majesty, or her Minister acting in his capacity as a Minister of the Province.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[15]", "In the Minister's submission, paragraphs 3, 6, 7, 9(d), 9(e) and 9(f) as well as reference to Her Majesty in the title of the proceedings should be struck on the basis that the court does not have jurisdiction over Her Majesty in right of a Province.

The plaintiff states that the Action of the Second defendant in taking possession of the defendant Ship was highhanded and oppressive in that the taking thereof was planned and deliberate and without notice to the plaintiff in that the Second defendant by its Agents caused the plaintiff to be called to a meeting with the Second defendant's Agent in relation to the vessel which meeting was set for 2:00 p.m. October 26th, 1992, and upon the plaintiff's attendance for the meeting and his consequent absence from the vessel, the Second defendant surreptitiously and deceitfully by its Agents caused locks on the vessel to be broken open and the vessel to be forcefully entered and put under way.

The plaintiff submits that once a person appears in an action in rem, that person is in the same position as if he or she had been brought before the court by personal notice. Thus, it is said, that by defending and filing a counterclaim, the Minister here has responded on behalf of Her Majesty to the statement of claim in personam and has submitted to the jurisdiction of the court. In addition, it is said that Her Majesty accepted all of the provisions for relief under the", "Federal Court Act", "by filing the counterclaim, though admittedly that counterclaim has since been withdrawn.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[17]", "For the plaintiff it is also submitted that this court has jurisdiction over maritime matters under the", "Federal Court Act", ", whether in rem or in personam, and, as a result, this court has jurisdiction to determine the action brought, including the claims for relief, against the Minister, in personam.

I am persuaded that by limiting the definition of the Crown in s. 2, it was intended that an action brought pursuant to s. 17 could only be brought as against Her Majesty in right of Canada, and the possibility of bringing an action against Her Majesty in right of a Province was implicitly excluded.

Moreover, in my view, even if the Minister were considered to submit to the jurisdiction of this court in his capacity as a Minister of the Province, that could not extend the court's jurisdiction, which, it is well settled, is defined by statute.

Insofar as he was acting within the scope of his duties, his liability is governed by the provincial law of New Brunswick and insofar as he may have been acting outside of those duties, the plaintiff may have an action in tort.

It is well settled that a claim against a provincial government employee for alleged wrong done within the scope of his provincial duties may be pursued in the courts of the province concerned, insofar as provincial legislation may permit.

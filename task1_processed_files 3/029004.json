The Registrar was also satisfied that sufficient evidence was filed to prove the Cited Mark has been used by Suzuki Canada as a licensee of the Opponent. Then, the Registrar rejected the Applicant's argument that the Respondent's caps were promotional goods only. It found that the sale of HAYABUSA caps by Suzuki Canada to authorized dealers was sufficient to establish sales in the normal course of trade. The Registrar also rejected the Applicant's argument that the Cited Mark was a secondary mark since it was always used with the trade-mark SUZUKI or the \"S\" logo, on the basis that the", "Act", "does not distinguish between primary and secondary marks. The Registrar added that, quite apart from the fact that the Cited Mark is not necessarily shown in close proximity to the word SUZUKI or the \"S\" logo, the evidence also shows the Cited Mark by itself on caps.

However, it concluded that, as of the relevant date, the Cited Mark had become known to some extent in Canada, something that had not been achieved by the Mark. In relation to the time of use (paragraph 6(5)(", ")), since the Cited Mark has been in use in association with motorcycle and fittings thereof since 2000 and with caps since 2005, this factor also favours the Respondent."], ["[19]", "Regarding the nature of the wares (paragraph 6(5)(", ")) and the nature of the trade (paragraph 6(5)(", ")), the Registrar noted that the case law cited and relied upon by both parties was of no help since these cases could be distinguished and each situation has to be decided on its own facts. The Registrar found that the nature of the wares associated with the Cited Mark differs from the nature of the wares in association with the Mark (motorcycles versus clothing), however, concluded there was an overlap with the caps associated with the Cited Mark, since footwear (sandals and grappling shoes), included in the Applicant's statement of wares, is related to clothing items. As to the nature of trade, the Registrar stated that even if the Opponent's statement of wares was not restricted to any particular channel of trade, this factor was not relevant under the non-entitlement analysis (although it would be under a non-registrability analysis). The Registrar also concluded that Mr. Chung's cross-examination did not establish that the Respondent's sales practices had evolved beyond the sale to authorized dealerships."], ["[20]", "On the grounds of non-entitlement, the Registrar therefore concluded that the Applicant had not met its burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, the absence of confusion, since the probabilities of confusion were evenly balanced between a finding of confusion and of non-confusion. Even if the channel of trade of the Respondent was restricted based on the fact that the Cited Mark is known more for motorcycles than for caps, this factor would not have been sufficient to shift the balance in favour of the Applicant.

Consequently, the distinctiveness of the Mark was negated. The Registrar also stated that the analysis of the factors listed in subsection 6(5) of the", "Act", "at the filing date of the Statement of Opposition, did not significantly impact the conclusion reached under the non-entitlement analysis.

The Registrar acknowledged that both marks possess an important degree of inherent distinctiveness, but concluded that the Respondent's trade-mark had become known to some extent in Canada before the Applicant's filing date and even more so by the relevant date for non-distinctiveness. I agree with the Respondent that there is nothing in the Clement Affidavit that could have affected those findings of the Registrar.

In addition to the fact that the Mark is identical to the cited Mark, in reaching this conclusion, I have had special regard to the length of the time the Cited Mark had been in use and the extent to which it had become known in Canada. Even if I recognize that the Cited Mark may have been more known for motorcycles than for caps, it remains that the Cited Mark had been used in association with caps which overlap with or relate to the applied-for wares.

This is quite remarkable, since she had previously found that the marks at issue were identical and that the Opponent was therefore considerably favoured by that factor.

The specific manner in which the Respondent used its trade-mark in actual commerce and the channel of trade used by the Respondent for its caps should have been given more weight, especially in light of the Registrar's finding that the cross-examination of Mr. Chung \"does not show an evolution in the Opponent's sales practices\". Even if the Registrar had been entitled to look at other potential channels of trade for the Respondent's caps, it was very unlikely that it would sell its products through channels of trade other than Suzuki dealers. The decision of the Trade-marks Opposition Board in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at pp 94-95 is apposite in that respect, despite the fact that there was relatively little similarity in appearance and no similarity in the ideas suggested by the applicant's and the opponent's marks in that case:", "In considering the issue of confusion in relation to the non-entitlement and non-distinctiveness grounds, the Registrar must have regard to the opponent's actual wares and channels of trade associated with those wares. Thus, while the wares covered in the applicant's application and the clothing sold by the opponent to its distributor in Canada are essentially identical, the channels of trade associated with the wares of the parties would not overlap. In particular, the opponent's evidence confirms that its GUY LAROCHE clothing is sold almost exclusively to Guy Laroche Boutiques which sell only the opponent's wares to consumers in Canada. As a result, the applicant's wares would not be sold through boutiques operated by the opponent's Canadian distributors."], ["[49]", "The evidence clearly shows that the caps sold by the Respondent, even if not promotional strictly speaking, since they are sold to authorized dealers, would most likely be purchased by consumers who are familiar with Suzuki motorcycles and who either own or would like to own such a motorcycle. These caps are sold through a single channel of trade and to targeted customers (i.e. Suzuki motorcycle dealers and, eventually, Suzuki motorcycle customers). Combined with the fact that the Registrar gave no weight to Mr. Chung's statement as to the Respondent's intent to sell a line of HAYABUSA clothing in Canada, this is a significant factor. It means that there can be no overlap between the channel of trade used by the Respondent to sell its caps and the regular channels of trade for clothing items, and even less so with the very specialized channels of trade used by the Applicants for its applied-for wares. As a result, it is difficult to conceive any likelihood of confusion between the Cited Mark and the Mark."], ["[50]", "Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the Applicant has advertised its wares in magazines which also included advertisements for vehicles, thereby demonstrating that vehicle companies advertise in the same medium as the Applicant, while targeting the same consumers. I find this argument unpersuasive. Only two such advertisements by car companies have been noted in the more than 1000 pages in magazines where the Applicant advertises its wares, and produced as answers to undertakings following the cross-examination of Craig Clement. More importantly, the fact that the Applicant and the Respondent may sometimes cater to the same consumers does not mean that these consumers will be confused as to the source or origin of their respective wares."], ["[51]", "In short, I find that the different channels of trade for the products of the Applicant and the Respondent were a most crucial factor that should have tipped the balance in favour of the Applicant. The Registrar could not reasonably conclude, on the basis of the evidence that was before her, that this factor was not sufficient to shift the balance of probabilities in favour of the Applicant. If, as she found, the probabilities of confusion between the Mark for clothing items and the Cited Mark for caps were evenly balanced, the fact that it is virtually impossible to find these wares in the same channels of trade should have been determinative."], ["[52]", "As the analysis for non-distinctiveness is essentially the same as for non-entitlement (except for the relevant date of November 13, 2007 as opposed to February 3, 2006), and since the Registrar found that the distinctiveness ground of opposition succeeds for the same reasons as those expressed in regards to the paragraph 16(3)(", ") ground of opposition, my preceding remarks regarding the Registrar's failure to give proper weight to the different channels of trade through which the Applicant's and Respondent's wares are sold, apply with equal force. Considering the limited number of caps sold by the Respondent between 2005 and 2008, there is no evidence that the Respondent's Cited Mark would have been better known in November 2007 than it was one year and a half earlier.", "C.", "Can the Court decide the remaining grounds of opposition that the Opposition Board chose not to decide?"], ["[53]", "Both parties have requested the Court to assess the grounds of opposition that were not decided by the Registrar, namely registrability pursuant to paragraph 12(1)(", ") of the", "Act", "and non-conformity with respect to paragraph 30(", ") of the", "Act", ". I shall do so briefly. Counsel for the Respondent made no representations with respect to these two grounds of opposition, either in writing or orally."], ["[54]", "In its Amended Statement of Opposition, the Respondent alleges that the application does not conform with the requirements of paragraph 30(", ") of the", "Act", ", because it does not contain a statement in ordinary commercial terms of the specific wares in association with the proposed use of the Mark. More particularly, the Respondent alleges that the statement of wares refers to \"clothing\" whereas some of the wares included within this definition (i.e. headwear and footwear) are not clothing."], ["[55]", "This argument is without merit. Although the Registrar did not expressly address this ground of opposition, she indicated at paragraph 42 of the decision that footwear is related to clothing items. The same may be said of headwear. Indeed, the online Merriam-Webster dictionary defines \"clothing\" as \"the things that people wear to cover their bodies\". Also of note is the fact that the enumeration after the word \"clothing\" in the description of the wares is preceded by the word \"namely\", which is a clear indication that the list is not to be interpreted as being exhaustive. For those reasons, this ground of opposition must be dismissed."], ["[56]", "As for the ground of opposition based on paragraph 12(1)(", ") of the", "Act", ", it must also be dismissed essentially for the reasons already given with respect to the opposition based on paragraph 16(3)(", ") of the", "Act", ". While the material date is different, (being that of the Registrar's decision dated March 8, 2012), it is clear that what was true in 2006 was equally (if not more) true six years later. When assessing the nature of the Respondent's registered wares and its trade, and comparing same to the Applicant's wares and the nature of its trade, there is no doubt that both parties use entirely different channels of trade to sell their wares and target specialized and distinct audiences that are unlikely to overlap."], ["[57]", "Moreover, I agree with counsel for the Applicant that in the context of the non-entitlement ground of opposition, motorcycles and fittings (which are the only wares covered by the Respondent's trade-mark TMA 526,151) differ considerably from the applied-for wares of the Applicant. The Respondent's motorcycles and fittings are only sold in Canada through the Respondent's authorized dealers, and the publicity associated with these products is mostly featured in motorcycle magazines. When dealerships advertise the Respondent's motorcycles and fittings in local newspapers, it is the Respondent's main brand SUZUKI that is prominently featured as opposed to the Cited Mark. This is clearly in contrast with the Applicant's business and channels of trade."], ["[58]", "I further agree with the Applicant that the Registrar erred in dismissing cases such as", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  84 CPR (3d) 102 (TMOB) and", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  cases, the opponents' mark was not associated with clothing as is the case here. In the case at bar, however, the caps sold by the Respondent in association with the Cited Mark were closely tied to its motorcycles. Be that as it may, that distinction was not sufficient, in my view, to ignore the general principle for which these cases stand: when one uses a trade-mark in the sale of vehicles and parts thereof, it will not normally cause confusion for another party (absent evidence to the contrary) to use a similar trade-mark for different wares sold through different channels of trade.", "VI.", "Conclusion"], ["[59]", "For all of the foregoing reasons, the appeal is granted and the decision of the Registrar is set aside.

This was acknowledged by Dr. Payne in cross-examination. Professor Galloway conceded that the training received by members and RPOs and their involvement in hundreds of refugee hearings may well give them more experience and aptitude in questioning claimants than novice counsel. In cases where the questioning inhibits claimants' ability to present their cases, the Court can and will intervene if they have not been afforded a fair hearing."], ["[120]", "There is considerable strength to the applicants' argument that vulnerable claimants require greater care in presenting their evidence and that may well mean that counsel should be permitted to assist their clients by questioning them first, but I am not persuaded that this cannot be accommodated on a case-by-case basis with prior notice to the Board that a change in the order may be required. It is not every case that would require counsel to question first and I am satisfied from the additional evidence filed in these proceedings that members can and do make appropriate decisions to change the order of questioning when presented with a request and supporting information."], ["[121]", "An additional factor raised in these proceedings is the perceived distortion of the role of the Board member. The function of making decisions on a daily basis that have profound implications for those appearing before them is very challenging. Guideline 7 adds to the burden of that task as members must often now take on a lead role in questioning where no RPO is present, which is increasingly common."], ["[122]", "The applicants submit that while a Board member can and should ask questions to clarify matters that arise in the course of a hearing, it is not appropriate for the member to take on the role of counsel or the RPO and conduct an examination and/or cross-examination of a refugee claimant. The member should remain out of the arena in order to impartially assess the evidence presented in the course of the hearing and intervene only when necessary to clarify or gather evidence necessary to the determination if that evidence has not been elicited by counsel or the RPO. Guideline 7, it is submitted, impedes the adjudicative role of the member and this further contributes to the denial of procedural fairness."], ["[123]", "In support of this argument, the applicants rely upon a statement by Justice Stone of the Federal Court of Appeal in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 135 N.R. 300 (F.C.A.) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), in which he observed that the Court was concerned \"that the Board Member, by her questioning, may have removed her judicial hat and put on the hat of an advocate\". This arose in the context of extensive questioning by the Member after the evidence of the claimant had already been elicited by counsel and the refugee hearing officer. Justice Stone referred to the principles respecting judicial intervention in hearings and concluded that the questioning had remained within the bounds of propriety."], ["[124]", "The question was raised in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> by the Court on its own motion and does not appear to have been fully argued by the parties. Moreover it occurred in the context of proceedings under the former legislation and the order of questioning was not in issue. Justice Stone's discussion supports the principles that a Board member must act fairly, impartially and judiciously, and does not stand, in my view, for the proposition that a member should not question a claimant or, indeed, that a member may not question in advance of the claimant's counsel."], ["[125]", "Some of the applicants have submitted that an additional factor in determining the content of the duty of fairness in refugee hearings should be the short time allowed for the preparation of the claimants Personal Information Form (PIF). The argument is that as it is more difficult to present a complete history within the 28-day deadline, this has made it all the more necessary for claimants to present their cases first with the assistance of counsel. Further, they submit, the filing of the PIF and the presentation of the claimant's narrative in written form does not mitigate the need for an examination-in-chief. This is particularly so because of the central role that credibility determinations play in refugee proceedings. Since natural justice requires that credibility be assessed primarily on the basis of viva voce evidence, it follows that presentation of the PIF is not an adequate substitution for an examination-in-chief, the applicants submit."], ["[126]", "However, as also found by Justice Blanchard, the PIF is not the only way claimants may tell their story to the panel. They may also submit documentary evidence, make further written submissions before the hearing, make oral representations at the hearing and may have the opportunity to subsequently file further submissions.

These factors, in my view, all serve to fetter Board Members' discretion. As Mr. Aterman acknowledged in testimony given on cross-examination: 'It's a balancing which respects adjudicative independence on the one hand and the public and institutional interests in consistency on the other hand.' In the circumstances of this case, the balancing of these interests, essentially because of the mandatory language used in Guideline 7, results in the interests of consistency outweighing the adjudicative independence of the Board Member. The mandatory language of Guideline 7, the limited and narrow description of exceptional circumstances provided for in the guideline and the not so subtly expressed expectation of compliance by the IRB, all combine to limit a Board Member's discretion.

The language of paragraph 23 may leave a member with the impression that he or she has no option but to follow the guideline in such cases. At the very least, in my view, paragraph 23 by requiring 'exceptional circumstances' for straying from the norm deters the member from considering other factors before deciding what order of questioning is appropriate. Guideline 7 would in effect, in such a case, serve to fetter the member's discretion.\""], ["[144]", "In urging me to depart from these conclusions, the respondent submits that the language of the Guideline has to be read as permissive rather than mandatory in keeping with the principles established in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 558, that discretion given by statute cannot be confined by general policy statements and that a term such as \"will normally\" does not mean \"in every case\".

He received special training and was tasked with confiscating firearms and capturing gang members.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "In November 2004, while on leave, the applicant was approached by three well known gang members: El Buda, La Pantera, and El Singo. The applicant was physically assaulted, and would have been killed if bystanders had not intervened.

The Board noted the applicant's counsel's argument at the hearing that the nexus arose from the applicant's membership in the armed forces, more particularly members of the Anti-Gang Task Force, who were responsible for working with police to arrest members of MS 13 and MS 18.

The Board found that the applicant was a victim of crime, but that this did not provide a nexus to a s 96 ground.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[11]", "Regarding s 97, the Board accepted the applicant's testimony and the documentary evidence demonstrating the widespread violence in El Salvador at the hands of MS 13. The Board noted that MS 13 is the largest criminal network in the Americas, and one of the most prolific in the world. It also accepted that if a recruit is unwilling to join the El Salvadorian Maras, the person's family and friends will all be in danger, as the Maras do not hesitate to eliminate those who defy them. However, the Board also found that the risks faced by the applicant were generalized, and therefore fell into the exception set out in s 97(1) (b)(ii). The Board referenced the National Documentation Package which indicated that the MS brought about major threats to public security in El Salvador, and that the risk of being a victim of violence or crime at the hands of organized gangs is one faced generally by all citizens and residents of El Salvador.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[12]", "The Board noted that the applicant had refused to join the MS 13, and found that subsequent threats and attacks against him were escalations as a result of his original decision not to join. The Board accepted that there were further consequences because the applicant joined the armed forces and worked against the gangs, but found that the subsequent threats and actions against him arose from the initial attempts to recruit him. The Board found that the applicant could not personalize the risk to him beyond membership in the subgroup of young men who are recruited to become gang members.

The Board's view appears to be that there is no relevant distinction between a refusal to join the gang and participation in an anti-gang task force. This Court finds that this is not a reasonable possible conclusion because the applicant's participation in the Antimaras operation has affected and significantly altered the risk he faces from MS 13, so as to make it a personalized risk not faced by other young men in the armed forces or in the population at large.

If it has done this (as the Federal Court of Appeal held and, in my opinion, rightly so) there can be no jurisdictional infirmity when the Board is protected in its determinations by a privative clause.

The tribunal has the right to make errors, even serious ones, provided it does not act in a manner 'so patently unreasonable that its construction cannot be rationally supported by the relevant legislation and demands intervention by the court upon review' (p. 237). The test for review is a 'severe test'; see", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 493. This restricted scope of review requires the courts to adopt a posture of deference to the decisions of the tribunal. Curial deference is more than just a fiction courts resort to when they are in agreement with the decisions of the tribunal. Mere disagreements with the result arrived at by the tribunal does not make that result 'patently unreasonable'. The courts must be careful to focus their inquiry on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal, and not on their agreement with it. The emphasis should be not so much on what result the tribunal has arrived at, but on how the tribunal arrived at that result. Privative clauses, such as those contained in ss. 31 and 34 of the", "Code", ", are permissible exercises of legislative authority and, to the extent that they restrict the scope of curial review within their constitutional jurisdiction, the court should respect that limitation and defer to the Board.\" (emphasis not in original text)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Here is the slightly variant, but \"important respect\" in which Sopinka, J., differs from his colleague, at pp. 1017-18:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"While I agree generally with La Forest, J., on the principles underlying the scope and standard of review of labour board decisions, I cannot agree that it is always necessary for the reviewing court to ignore its own view of the merits of the decision under review. Any adjudication upon the reasonableness of a decision must involve an evaluation of the merits. Reasonableness is not a quality that exists in isolation. When a court says that a decision under review is \"reasonable\" or \"patently unreasonable\" it is making a statement about the logical relationship between the grounds of the decision and premises thought by the court to be true. Without the reference point of an opinion (if not a conclusion) on the merits, such a relative statement cannot be made.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"I share La Forest, J.'s, opinion of the importance of curial deference in the review of specialist tribunals' decisions. But, in my view, curial deference does not enter the picture until the court finds itself in disagreement with the tribunal. Only then is it necessary to consider whether the error (so found) is within or outside the boundaries of reasonableness. The test is, as La Forest, J., points out, citing", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a 'severe test'. But even here an appreciation of the merits is not irrelevant. Lamer, J., speaking for himself and McIntyre, J.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", ", stated at pp. 494-95:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "'... though all errors do not lead to unreasonable findings, every unreasonable finding results from an error (whether of law, fact, or a combination of the two), which is unreasonable.'  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"So long as the court is satisfied with the correctness of the tribunals' decision, any reference to reasonableness is superfluous. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "Canada (Procureur général) v.

At this initial stage a pragmatic or functional analysis is just as suited to a case in which an error is alleged in the interpretation of a provision limiting the administrative tribunal's jurisdiction: in a case where a patently unreasonable error is alleged on a question within the jurisdiction of the tribunal, as in a case, where simple error is alleged regarding a provision limiting that jurisdiction, the first step involves determining the tribunal's jurisdiction.'

Section 33 is intended to enable the Board to resolve any question as to whether an employee or class of employees is or is not included in a bargaining unit. In the absence of a definition of 'employee', it could be argued that the Board could determine who is an employee on the basis of tests that are generally employed in labour matters. These tests are customarily employed to resolve a dispute as to whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor. The express definition of 'employee', however, shows a clear intention by Parliament that it has decided the category of employee over which the Board is to have jurisdiction. It is restricted to persons employed in the Public Service and who are not covered by the", "Canada Labour Code", ".

This case considered the jurisdiction of an arbitrator.

Had that issue properly been before this court, I have no doubt that the scope of our review of that aspect of the arbitration award would have been a narrow one - we would have embarked on a patent unreasonability enquiry. However, on the more general level at which the jurisdictional debate was engaged in this court, I am of the view that the appropriate scrutiny of the arbitrator's decision is to a standard of correctness. My reasons for this position are set out below, but at this juncture I should perhaps comment on this stratified approach to the issues arising from the arbitrator's award.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"To begin, I would not wish my conclusions on the standard of review in this case to be taken as a retreat from the deferential approach to judicial review of administrative tribunals since the decision of this Court in", "Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 963 v.

Nor are the conclusions here inconsistent with the previous statements by this court as to the appropriate scope of judicial review of arbitration awards made pursuant to s. 44 of the", "Act", ". This court has stated in previous cases that courts should, as a matter of policy, defer to the expertise of the arbitrator is questions relating to the interpretation of collective agreements; ... It is clear that an arbitrator has jurisdiction stricto sensu to interpret the provisions of a collective agreement in the course of determining the arbitrability of matters under that agreement. In that case the arbitrator in acting within his or her 'home territory', and any judicial review of that interpretation must only be to a standard of patent unreasonableness. But this is a different case. Here, the viability and subsistence of the collective agreement is challenged. The company alleges that regardless of the interpretation of the agreement, it cannot survive to serve as the basis for this arbitration. The collective agreement is the foundation of the arbitrator's jurisdiction, and in determining that it exists or subsists the arbitrator must be correct. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "La Forest, J., on the principal appeal concluded, at p. 305:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "\"To summarize, I am of the view that retirement rights can, if contemplated by the terms of a collective agreement, survive the expiration of that agreement. Moreover, although it is not strictly necessary to decide the point in this appeal, I would also find that these surviving rights vest at the time of retirement, and would survive subsequent collective bargaining that purported to divest such rights. As such, I have concluded that the arbitrator's general propositions in this respect were correctly stated, and the arbitrator had jurisdiction to hear the union's grievance. Of course, I make no comment on whether the terms of the agreement between the company and the union do in fact create such a vested right. That is a question for the arbitrator to decide when the arbitration hearing proceeds on the merits. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[18]", "Hard on the heels of the", "Dayco", "judgment, came the Supreme Court's judgment in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a four-to-one decision with Mr. Justice Gonthier writing for the majority.

The RPD did not consider the grounds for protection put forward by the Applicant because it found that he is excluded from refugee protection under Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention.

It appears he returned to the US illegally in March 2008, and remained there until he came to Canada in December 2011."], ["[4]", "The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness [Minister] intervened in the RPD proceeding on the issue of whether the Applicant was excluded from refugee protection based on the above-noted charges.", "DECISION UNDER REVIEW"], ["[5]", "The RPD found that documents provided by the Minister alleged that the Applicant broke into a dwelling and stole approximately $5,000 worth of possessions.

The Board broke its analysis up into two parts, addressing first whether there were \"serious reasons\" for considering that the claimant had committed a non-political crime before entering Canada, and second, whether that crime was \"serious\" for the purposes of Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention."], ["[8]", "The Board found that there were two \"dramatically different\" accounts of the events that led to the charges in the US. The Applicant stated in his Personal Information Form [PIF] narrative that he had moved into a new house in Tampa, Florida, and went next door to see if he could use their garbage can. The house was abandoned and in disrepair, he said, and in the four to five months he had lived next door there had been no one living there. He discovered an old vehicle without an engine on the property, and took the key that was left in the ignition because he was attracted by a deer decoration on the key. He then left and went to the store and, when he returned, the police were waiting and arrested him. He made no mention in his PIF of having entered the house."], ["[9]", "During his testimony before the RPD, the Applicant said that, in addition to taking the key from the old vehicle, he also entered the house. The door was slightly ajar, and he put his shoulder into it and it opened. He was curious and walked around the house, which was in disrepair with the ceiling falling down. He was struck by the artistic beauty of two ceramic dogs, and put them in his pocket. He then left to conduct some business and was arrested by police when he returned later that night. The Board observed (at paras 15-17):", "The claimant stated he was not aware of being charged with any offences as a result of entering the house. He stated the first he learned of these charges was when he came to Canada and made a refugee claim.", "He allegedly was held in custody in the U.S. after his arrest on December 20, 2006 until he was deported to Honduras. He stated he was transferred to an immigration hold in February 2007 and asked to be deported to Honduras. He was deported in March 2007.", "The claimant was asked why he did not include the fact that he entered the house in his PIF narrative and he stated that he had forgotten he actually entered the house and took the two ceramic dogs until in the process of preparing for his Immigration Division hearing."], ["[10]", "The Board found that the Applicant's account of these events was \"in stark contrast to the evidence entered by the Minister.\" A police report stated that on December 19, 2006, the Applicant forced his way into an unoccupied dwelling and removed property with an estimated value of $5,000 USD and took it to his residence. He was arrested on the evening of December 20, 2006 as a result of a driving violation, and after being advised of his \"Miranda\" rights, admitted to breaking into the house and stealing the property. A copy of the charges filed by the State Attorney showed that the Applicant was charged with one count of Burglary of a Dwelling and one count of Grand Theft Third Degree ($300-$5,000)."], ["[11]", "The Minister also submitted a declaration from a Canada Border Services Agency [CBSA] Officer. The CBSA Officer contacted Robert Earl Knowles Sr., who said that the house belonged to his aunt, who had passed away. Mr. Knowles had been advised of the break and enter by police on the day it occurred. He was told that a group of individuals renting the house next door had broken in through a back window and stolen a large amount of property, and that the culprits had been removed from the US. He said that stolen items included a couple hundred ceramic dogs, a vacuum cleaner, vases, and other items he could not specifically remember. The CBSA Officer observed (at para 22):", "Although Officer Clarke's declaration is silent on the particulars regarding the status of the house the charges filed by the State Attorney state that the property was that of Robert Knowles and/or the Estate of Emily Hazel. I conclude from this that the owner of the house was Emily Hazel and that she had died and Robert Knowles was her Executor."], ["[12]", "The RPD found that the two \"drastically different versions\" of the events leading up to the criminal charges required an assessment of \"the credibility of the evidence.\" The Board stated that it had carefully examined the evidence and strongly preferred the Minister's evidence over that of the Applicant. The Applicant had failed to state in his PIF that he entered the house, and it was not credible that he had forgotten this but remembered taking the key from the old car. It was \"more likely that the claimant was trying to hide from the reader that he entered the house.\" In addition, the police report was very specific about what had occurred. The Board found that it is \"the job of the police in a democratic country like the U.S. to impartially investigate incidents,\" and there was no reason to believe this was not done in the present matter. The Board continued (at paras 26-28):", "... The police report is corroborated by the charges laid by the State Attorney. The U.S. is a highly democratic country and I find that criminal charges would not be laid if there was not evidence to support them. The claimant stated that all he was guilty of was taking a key out of the ignition of an old car and taking two ceramic dogs from the house. If this were true then he would not have been charged with Grand Theft Third Degree ($300-$5,000). The value of the key and two ceramic dogs would be far less than $300.", "I find the claimant's evidence not to be credible and therefore place little weight on it and place considerably more weight on the evidence contained in the police report and in Officer Clarke's declaration regarding what Mr. Knowles had to say about the break in of his aunt's house. I find it implausible that the claimant would face the charges he did if what he stated was true.", "I therefore find that the claimant broke into his neighbour's house with the intention of stealing anything of value that he might encounter therein and that he did steal various items of a value of approximately $5,000 USD."], ["[13]", "Based on the above, the Board found that there were serious reasons for considering that the Applicant committed the crimes of Burglary of a Dwelling and Grand Theft Third Degree in the State of Florida."], ["[14]", "As to whether these crimes were \"serious\" for the purposes of Article 1F(b), the Board agreed with the Minister that if the same acts were committed in Canada, the Applicant would have been charged under s. 348(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The Board then considered the factors set out in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], which it enumerated as follows (at para 32):", "• an evaluation of the elements of the crime;", "• the mode of prosecution;", "• the penalty prescribed; and", "• the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction."], ["[15]", "The Board found that the Applicant had not appeared in criminal court to answer to the charges, so there was no penalty prescribed. With respect to the elements of the crime, the RPD rejected as not being credible the Applicant's evidence that he entered the house to satisfy his curiosity and had no intent of stealing anything, taking the two ceramic dogs only because of their artistic appeal. Rather, the RPD stated that it relied on the police report and court documents. Based on this evidence, the Board concluded that the Applicant was one of several occupants renting a house next door to the house in question, and that the owner, Emily Hazel, passed away and her house was left unoccupied. It was not an abandoned house, but rather formed part of an estate, and had not ceased to be a dwelling. The RPD did not accept that it was a run down and crumbling structure as the Applicant described. Rather (at para 36):", "Ms. Hazel's nephew, Mr. Robert Knowles, was responsible for the estate and it is logical to conclude that, as executor, he attended to the maintenance needs of the house ..."], ["[16]", "It was unclear whether the Applicant was held in custody until deported in March as he alleged, or was released from custody. However, the Applicant had failed to attend an interview for the Pre-Trial Intervention program, which suggested he was not incarcerated, and it did not seem logical that the State of Florida would issue a warrant for failing to appear in court on April 16, 2007 if the Applicant had been deported in March 2007."], ["[17]", "With respect to mitigating factors, the Board found that it was reasonable to conclude that the Applicant was aware that the house he broke into was unoccupied, which would greatly reduce the chances of him having to confront a resident. The State Attorney felt that the circumstances might warrant having the offence dealt with through a diversion program (though in the end the Applicant did not qualify), which suggested it was considered less serious than break and enters committed under different circumstances."], ["[18]", "With respect to aggravating factors, the RPD observed that s. 348 of the", "Criminal Code", "sets out a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the break and enter of a dwelling house, indicating the seriousness with which Canadian law makers view this offence. The Applicant would have no way of knowing that the owner of the property was deceased; she could have been on an extended holiday or hospitalized, and could return home at any time. The Board found that \"[h]e was obviously prepared to take anything of value and was reckless to what kind of harm this might inflict on the owner of the property both in terms of stolen property and psychologically regarding feeling violated and unsafe as a result of the break in.\" In addition, he was reckless to the sentimental value the items might hold. To this date, the RPD found, the Applicant has not taken responsibility for his actions, maintaining that he had no intent to steal when he entered the house which was \"simply not believable.\" In support of this version of events, he \"was untruthful in his PIF narrative regarding the circumstances surrounding the criminal charges\" and \"omitted any details about entering the house which is a lie by omission.\" He had not made restitution to the victim, and although the police report stated that he expressed regret, \"his actions avoiding his responsibilities to the court demonstrate the opposite.\" The Board continued (at paras 52-53):", "The claimant was reckless to the fact that break and enter of a dwelling often leave a significant psychological impact on the victims. They no longer feel safe in their residence, a place that should serve as a sanctuary for the owners. Victims often feel violated knowing that someone was in their house and going through their most personal possessions. This, no doubt, is part of the reason that our law makers view this offence with such severity.", "Although of the belief that the house he broke into was vacant the claimant could not have been assured he would not confront anyone. The executor could have walked in, the owner could have returned (the claimant had no way of knowing the owner was deceased) after their holiday or hospitalization. If he was confronted the chances of this break and enter escalating into something even more serious was a distinct possibility. He obviously was prepared to take this chance."], ["[19]", "The Board found that these were all aggravating factors, and that after considering all of the factors set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the crime the Applicant committed was \"a serious matter that could reasonably have serious consequences far beyond the loss of property.\" As such, the Applicant had committed a serious, non-political crime before his entry to Canada and was excluded from the definition of a refugee and a person in need of protection under Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention and s. 98 of the Act.", "ISSUES"], ["[20]", "The Applicant raises the following issues for the Court's consideration in this proceeding:", "a.

The Applicant agrees, except when it comes to questions of the content and effect of foreign law, which is relevant to issues e. and f. above. The content of foreign law is a finding of fact, the Applicant argues, while the determination of how the foreign law is applied is a question of law. While older case law held that the standard of review for findings of fact with respect to foreign law is reasonableness, the Federal Court of Appeal has recently suggested that it is correctness, the Applicant argues.

Robert Knowles could not state a value for the items, as reported in the CBSA Officer's statutory declaration. The Board found that the police report put the value at $5,000, and that this was reflected in the indictment for grand theft ($300-$5,000). However, the Board's reading of this evidence was incorrect. $5,000 is the upper limit of the charge listed on the indictment, and theft of $5,000 or more is a different offence in Florida, the Applicant argues.

Due to the lack of discussion of this issue in the Decision, the reviewing Court cannot conclude that the Board understood the intricacies of the offence of burglary in the law of Florida. In the absence of a foreign conviction, this lack of legal analysis is fatal to the Decision.

However, there was no discussion about why those elements were established, and in particular why the element of intent to commit offences at the time of entry was established. There was, the Applicant argues, neither documentary evidence of such an intent nor evidence of circumstances from which it could be inferred. Moreover, there were contradictions in the Minister's evidence regarding the circumstances of the offence that were not resolved by the Board (Did the Applicant act alone or with a group of men? Did he enter through the door or a window?), and this makes it impossible to discern why the Board found that the Applicant committed burglary rather than a combination of lesser offences such as trespass and theft.

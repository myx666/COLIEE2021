{"id_": "057702", "body_str": [["[1]", "Barnes, J.", ": The Applicants are three members of a Colombian family whose claim to refugee protection was denied by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration Refugee Board (Board) on February 24, 2011. Their claim to protection was based on a story of threats and persecution primarily directed at Luis Cuervo by the National Liberation Army (ELN) between 1988 and 1994. Mr. Cuervo alleged that he was targeted by the ELN because of his employment in the Second Criminal Court in Bogota.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[2]", "According to the Applicants, the situation was so dangerous that in 1994 they fled to the United States. In 1996 their claims to asylum in the United States were denied and in 2009 they sought protection in Canada on the strength of the same risk allegations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[3]", "The Board rejected the Applicants' claims on the basis that they had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection. Despite summarizing the evidence, the Board made no findings concerning the Applicants' credibility or the truthfulness of their factual allegations. This is surprising because the Board also concluded without any evidentiary analysis that there was no nexus to any of the statutory grounds for protection. The absence of a justification for this finding is, by itself, a basis for setting the Board's decision aside. However, for the reasons that follow, the Board's state protection finding is also insufficient and is a further basis for setting the decision aside.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[4]", "In the absence of any factual or credibility findings, I am obliged to carry out my review of the Board's state protection finding on the basis that the Applicants' allegations of past persecution by the ELN were accepted. Notwithstanding that history, the Board concluded, on the strength of country-condition evidence, that past victims of persecution at the hands of the ELN could now be adequately protected in Columbia and are no longer at risk.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[5]", "Where the Board fails to address the evidence of personal risk in a meaningful way or, as in this case, fails to address it at all, the application of country-condition evidence can be profoundly more difficult. This is because the Board lacks an evidentiary framework for its state protection analysis. Any lingering but unstated reservations about credibility or plausibility may cause the Board to apply the state protection evidence in a way that is unjustified or insensitive to the asserted risks. In this case that failure appears to have caused the Board to overlook material evidence that contradicted its conclusion that adequate state protection was available to the Applicants. If the Board had reminded itself that it had an obligation to consider the country-condition evidence in the context of a family that had been repeatedly targeted by the ELN, it undoubtedly would not have overlooked the evidence from several sources which indicated that, as targeted victims of the ELN, they could not be protected by the Colombian authorities.

Each of these cases did involve refugee claimants from Colombia who claimed to be at risk from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and each claim failed on the basis of a finding of adequate state protection. Nevertheless, these decisions are distinguishable from this application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "In", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court noted that \"a complete lack of analysis of an applicant's personal circumstances may render a decision unreasonable\". It is also clear from the Court's reasons that the Board carefully weighed evidence from Dr. Marc Chernick and discounted it for reasons that were found to be reasonable.

Human Rights Council and Dr. Brittain.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , indicates that the Board did examine the evidence of personal risk and rejected it on credibility grounds albeit for reasons that the Court later rejected as unreasonable. In commenting on the Board's state protection analysis, the Court held that the evidence said to have been overlooked was \"not of such relevance that the failure to specifically address it results in a decision made without regard to the evidence\". In this case, the evidence that the Board failed to mention starkly and directly contradicted its finding that adequate state protection was available for victims personally targeted by the FARC and the ELN.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The decision in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , indicates that the Board was influenced in part by the applicants' failure to pursue any state protection options before leaving Colombia. In upholding the Board's state protection finding, the Court also made no mention of any material evidence being overlooked and it described the Board's evidentiary analysis as principled and balanced. That is not a finding that is available on the record before me.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[10]", "Even if the Board's failure to make factual or credibility findings did not in this case give rise to a reviewable error, its failure to refer at all to the evidence of Drs.

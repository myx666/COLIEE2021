The applicants are citizens of China, and the principal applicant, Mrs. Limin Wang, was born on November 24, 1966.

She required a score of 67 points to immigrate to Canada. On October 17, 2006, the application was screened by the Officer, and she was awarded a score of 68 points, including five points for adaptability based on the fact that the male applicant had a brother, Huang Hai, living in Canada. Additional documents were requested including updated proof of the brother's residency in Canada. Documents were received on January 17, 2007.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[6]", "The processing of the file was delayed due to a concern about the genuine nature of the principal applicant's employment. This concern was resolved, and on June 26, 2007, the Officer made a second request for updated information that the male applicant's brother was residing in Canada. The applicants provided the following documents on July 26, 2007:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "a) A copy of the brother's permanent resident card;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "b) A copy of the brother's wife's permanent resident card and passport;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "c) A copy of the brother's 2007 Notice of Assessment;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "d) A copy of the brother's wife's 2007 Notice of Assessment;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "e) A copy of the brother's marriage certificate;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "f) A copy of land transfer registration (in the brother's wife's name).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "DECISION UNDER REVIEW  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[7]", "In his decision, the Officer assessed the applicant at 63 points. The applicant was awarded 10 points for age, 20 points for education, 8 points for official language proficiency, 21 points for experience, 0 points for arranged employment and 4 points for adaptability.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[8]", "The Officer concluded that the applicant had insufficient points to qualify for immigration to Canada. She noted that no points were awarded for the male applicant's brother, Huang Hai, living in Canada. She determined that the evidence provided by the applicants in support of this allegation was insufficient to establish that the brother resided in Canada at the time of the decision, based on the fact that the majority of the documentation provided related to the brother's wife and not him. Huang Hai's 2007 Notice of Assessment was the only document which related specifically to him. It indicated that he earned a total of $2,000 in 2006.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"], ["[9]", "The Officer noted that her records indicated that Huang Hai had prolonged absences from Canada in the past.

The Officer requested twice (January 17, 2007 and June 26, 2007) proof of this fact, this in itself is sufficient to put them on notice that the issue was a live one. Further, the Officer relied mainly on one document submitted by the applicant (2006 Notice of Assessment) to refuse the application.

The performance of their police functions are similar to those of other police forces and include law enforcement, crime prevention and investigations. The security duties of the military police include those of security or personnel, materiel, information and information technology and those related to military intelligence. The military police is also responsible for the custodial functions associated with service prisons or field detention barracks which may be required in operations.", "\"It is in the field of operations that military police's most important war time duties reside. Thus, the military police has an operational function which includes, inter alia, battlefield rear area and site security, route reconnaissance as well as traffic control for tactical movement, control of refugees,", "custody of prisoners of war", "and sundry direct defence duties in specific areas such as airfields. In short, the primacy of the operational mission will prevail over other duties when military police are deployed with forces in the field, be it in actual operations or in training.\" (Emphasis added)"], ["[65]", "The Somalia Inquiry Report states:", "\"In addition to their role in the military justice system, MP perform important combat functions. These include tactical and administrative movement control; route signing and traffic control; reception,", "custody, and control of prisoners of war or detainees", "; control of refugees; and all aspects of security. We acknowledge that MP performing these operations functions must form an integral part of the field formation and function under the operational chain of command. However, such an arrangement for Military Police engaged in providing", "police", "support to the military justice system may not afford adequate protection from command influence and thus may well undermine their effectiveness.\" (Emphasis added)"], ["[66]", "The conclusion of these Reports that custody of prisoners of war or detainees was an operational function was reached notwithstanding that Military Police are \"peace officers\" within the meaning of the", "Criminal Code", "and that the", "Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces", "both then and now include the arrest or custody of persons as falling within the duties of a peace officer."], ["[67]", "There is nothing in Hansard nor in the language of the regulation itself which suggests that the Governor in Council intended to give new meaning to \"established military custom or practice\", as clearly set out in the Dickson and Somalia Inquiry Reports. In the absence of evidence, it was unreasonable for the Commission to so find. Indeed, in a Special Report issued in December 2002, the previous Chair, Louise Cobetto stated:", "\"Finally, in addition to their police duties, Military Police members perform important military duties since, as part of operations, they are responsible for guarding, and supervising detainees or prisoners of war, overseeing detention barracks and conducting route surveys.\""], ["[68]", "Although the Chair refers to the Commission's expertise, there is no explanation as to why that expertise aids in modern statutory interpretation or leads to the conclusion that the Governor in Council by regulation intended to change established military custom. The obligation to give reasons is a requirement of procedural fairness. No reasons were given which disclose why the Commission's expertise in the area of military policing was of assistance (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )."], ["[69]", "As a matter of general statutory interpretation, I owe no deference. Judges interpret statutes and regulations. I cannot agree with the", "Constitution Act", "analogy that the enumeration of specific legislative powers falling within the provincial domain does not detract from the Federal Government's jurisdiction to make laws in relation to peace, order and good government. If it were not for the \"greater certainty\" provision in section 91, some matters which do relate to peace, order and good government would be construed as falling within provincial competence as matters of property and civil rights."], ["[70]", "Paradoxically, the Commission's position that sections 2(1) and 2(2) of the", "Conduct Regulations", "are mutually exclusive is supported by the Attorney General. It is his position that the capture and detention of insurgents is not and never has been a policing duty or function pertaining to the arrest or custody of a person. Furthermore, he submits that a release from custody is not the same as holding in custody. Those arrested or in custody are limited to members of the military and in certain circumstances to other Canadians within Canada. As this is the first decision dealing with the jurisdiction of the Military Police Complaints Commission, I think it preferable to say as little as possible with respect to submissions which did not influence my decision."], ["[71]", "I base myself on the Attorney General's subsidiary submission which was that even if the capture or detention of insurgents in Afghanistan could be considered as a policing function or duty, since that function or duty arises from \"established military custom or practice\", they are deemed not to be a matter of policing."], ["[72]", "I do not consider, to use a well-worn phrase used in the interpretation of the", "Constitution", ", that subsections (1) and (2) of section 2 are \"watertight compartments\". The very reason the words \"for greater certainty ...\" ... \"il est entendu ...\"(and I find no difference between the two) are inserted is that without them the scope of \"policing duties or functions\" including \"the arrest or custody of a person\" would be uncertain. Read out of context and on a stand alone basis, which the Commission has done, the custody of a detainee in Afghanistan could be construed as the custody of a person. In fact, it is the custody of a person, but it is not a policing duty or function. Military Police are assigned this duty in the field because of their special training in processing and interrogating persons and in the application of Canadian and international law, including the", "Geneva Conventions"], ["[73]", "To illustrate, sections 91 and 92 of the", "Constitution", "do not specifically mention insurance. One case which has stood the test of time is the decision of the Privy Council in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  entered into or enforced in a province fell within provincial jurisdiction as a matter of property and civil rights (s. 92(13)) or peace, order and good government, more particularly the \"regulation of trade and commerce\". Their lordships, speaking through Sir Montague Smith, held that insurance was a matter of property and civil rights and that therefore the statute enacted by the Province of Ontario was constitutional."], ["[74]", "According to Sir Montague Smith at pages 108 and 109:", "\"With regard to certain classes of subjects, therefore, generally described in sect. 91, legislative power may reside as to some matters falling within the general description of these subjects in the legislatures of the provinces. In these cases it is the duty of the Courts, however difficult it may be, to ascertain in what degree, and to what extent, authority to deal with matters falling within these classes of subjects exists in each legislature, and to define in the particular case before them the limits of their respective powers. It could not have been the intention that a conflict should exist; and, in order to prevent such a result, the two sections must be read together, and the language of one interpreted, and, where necessary, modified, by that of the other. In this way it may, in most cases, be found possible to arrive at a reasonable and practical construction of the language of the sections, so as to reconcile the respective powers they contain, and give effect to all of them. In performing this difficult duty, it will be a wise course for those on whom it is thrown, to decide each case which arises as best they can, without entering more largely upon an interpretation of the statute than is necessary for the decision of the particular question in hand.\"", "He continued at page 110:", "\"It becomes obvious, as soon as an attempt is made to construe the general terms in which the classes of subjects in sects. 91 and 92 are described, that both sections and the other parts of the", "Act", "must be looked at to ascertain whether language of a general nature must not by necessary implication or reasonable intendment be modified and limited. In looking at sect. 91, it will be found not only that there is no class including, generally, contracts and the rights arising from them, but that one class of contracts is mentioned and enumerated, viz., '18, bills of exchange and promissory notes', which it would have been unnecessary to specify if authority over all contracts and the rights arising from them had belonged to the dominion parliament.\""], ["[75]", "A follow-up to this decision is that of the Supreme Court of Canada in", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .

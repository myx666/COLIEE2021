The Applicant's counsel responded by referring to the previously submitted statutory declaration and advising that the Applicant's lawyer in the Philippines had told the Applicant that she had no right to require conduct of the medical examination under Philippine law. Further, the Applicant was now involved in a relationship in Canada and had given birth to a daughter on October 11, 2012."], ["[9]", "On March 4, 2013 CIC refused the Applicant's application for permanent residence in Canada.

Additionally, as seen from the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes, the Manila office of CIC had confirmed receipt of a letter from the Applicant's ex-husband stating that he refused to permit their daughter to be examined, that the Applicant had never extended financial support for the child, and, that the Applicant was now in a common law relationship with another person."], ["[17]", "The Applicant takes the view that she could not reasonably have been expected to do more.

The Respondent takes the position that none of the documents submitted by the Applicant are sufficient to support her claim that her ex-husband has sole custody of their daughter or of attempts to have her daughter examined. In particular, the daughter is not mentioned in the court documents regarding the divorce, and the statutory declaration was not notarized.", "Analysis"], ["[19]", "For the reasons that follow, in my view, the officer's decision to refuse the Applicant's application for permanent residence was not reasonable."], ["[20]", "Section 72 of the", "IRPA Regulations", "sets out the requirements for obtaining status as a permanent resident under the LIC class which include establishing that the applicant meets the selection criteria and other requirements of that class (section 72(1)(d)) and that the applicant and his or her family members, whether accompanying or not, are not inadmissible (section 72(1)(e)(I)).

As separated spouses can reconcile and custody arrangements for children may change, examination is required in order to safeguard the future right to sponsor them as members of the family class.

In fact, the officer's CAIPS notes, which form a part of the reasons for the decision (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 43 and 44), state that the Applicant \"has not provided any documentation regarding sole custody\". In another entry, the officer states that the statutory declaration was not notarized. However, the CIC letter requesting the statutory declaration, sent to the Applicant on November 28, 2011, states that, \"The statutory declaration must be administered by a Commissioner of Oaths or Notary Public\". As noted above, the statutory declaration was made before the Applicant's Canadian counsel who signed it as a \"Lawyer & Notary, A Commissioner etc.\""], ["[26]", "The officer was not compelled to accept the statutory declaration as de facto evidence that the Applicant's daughter was in the sole custody of her ex-husband (the provision of which distinguishes this matter from", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 1407 (QL)). However, in view of the guidance offered by Manual IP 4, in my opinion, the officer would need to provide a reasonable basis upon which to refuse to accept that evidence. In this case, the only possible explanation for doing so, being that the document was not \"notarized\", directly contravenes the requirements that CIC itself set out for the Applicant. It was, as required, administered by a Notary Public and Commissioner of Oaths."], ["[27]", "Further, as stated at page 22 of Manual IP 4, in countries where \"legal separation and divorce are not possible, for example, the Philippines\", it may also be that formal custody arrangements are not be easily attained since those arrangements would arise from the event of a separation or divorce."], ["[28]", "In these circumstances, the officer's refusal without explanation to accept the statutory declaration as evidence as to the custody of the Applicant's daughter was unreasonable."], ["[29]", "It must also be noted that the very reason that the medical examination policy exists-to safeguard the", "right of the Applicant", "to sponsor her daughter at a later date-had been unambiguously waived by the Applicant in her statutory declaration. The declaration thereby met the content requirement of CIC as set out in its November 28, 2012 letter."], ["[30]", "Subsection 117(9)(d) of the", "IRPA", "states that a foreign national shall not be considered a member of the family class by virtue of their relationship to a sponsor if the sponsor previously made an application for, became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor and was not examined. Thus, once the statutory declaration was received, the officer no longer had any reason to require that the Applicant's daughter be medically examined. Accordingly, it was unreasonable for the officer to continue to demand proof of attempts to have her examined and to refuse to grant the exception on the basis that she had failed to do so. Subsection 16(1) of the", "IRPA Regulations", "states that an applicant must produce all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires. The information as to the attempts by the Applicant to have her daughter medically examined was no longer relevant nor was it reasonably required."], ["[31]", "Finally, as is apparent from the CAIPS notes, there was also evidence before the officer that the Applicant had started a new relationship with a new common law spouse and had given birth to a child with her new spouse. This, as recognized by Manual IP 4, is supporting evidence that may be considered by the officer to establish that her prior relationship has truly broken down and that reconciliation was unlikely. The officer also had before him the Applicant's Certificate of Divorce from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice-further evidence that her relationship with her former husband was concluded."], ["[32]", "While an officer does not in his reasons have to refer to each and every piece of documentary evidence before him, if the evidence was significant, the omission may be fatal (", "<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 38). Here the whole premise of the officer's refusal to issue the permanent residence visa was based on the Applicant's alleged failure to produce proof of attempts to examine her daughter and/or custody documentation. The refusal to accept or the ignoring of the information provided by way of the statutory declaration and otherwise was fatal in these circumstances."], ["[33]", "As a final note, the Respondent's characterization of the facts-that the Applicant had been given four years to comply and that she did not-is not persuasive nor entirely accurate. A review of the record shows that the Applicant had been in constant communication with CIC, even before she filed her application for permanent residence, and had sought CIC's advice and kept CIC fully apprised of the difficulties she was facing as regards to her former spouse's refusal to permit the medical examination. CIC did not acknowledge the substance of these communications or other relevant information."], ["[34]", "In this situation the officer's reasons did not reflect the evidence that was before him and, given that evidence, his decision was not justifiable, transparent or intelligible and did not fall within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and the law."], ["[35]", "Accordingly, the application for judicial review is allowed.", "JUDGMENT"], ["[36]", "THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that", "this application for judicial review is allowed, the officer's decision is set aside and the matter is remitted back for re-determination by a different officer.

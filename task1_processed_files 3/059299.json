According to Jasvir and accepted by the Indian Court, there was never any adoption ceremony performed as required and she and Jagdev never lived with the adopting parents. Again, it is implausible that the applicant would not have known that no adoption ceremony was performed or where Jasvir and Jagdev were living.

She found implausible that Ms Xu readily revealed her membership in an illegal church given that Christians were facing significant persecution in Shandong Province."], ["[5]", "The RPD acknowledged the documents corroborating the Applicants' practice of Christianity in Canada but because of credibility concerns of the narrative of events in China, the Member did not find such documents and activities to be conclusive of their faith."], ["[6]", "The RPD also found that the narrative of being pursued by the PSB to be implausible because the PSB would know from its database that the Applicants were in Canada."], ["[7]", "Finally, the Member accepted that house churches could, in some places, be subject to persecution; however, targeted individuals tended to be leaders and given the large number of Christian practitioners in non-state approved churches, the Applicants had not established a serious possibility that they would be persecuted.", "III.", "Analysis"], ["[8]", "It is trite law by now that a) the interpretation and assessment of evidence (particularly credibility findings) are subject to the reasonableness standard of review and b) that the legal test for burden of proof attracts a correctness standard."], ["[9]", "The Applicants have attempted to make a legal issue out of terms such as \"conclusive evidence\" of their faith.

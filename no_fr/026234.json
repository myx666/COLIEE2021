{"id_": "026234", "body_str": ["[1] Snider, J. : The moving party in this case, Mr. Vivekananthan Nalliah, has commenced an application to this Court for leave and judicial review of a negative decision dated September 9, 2004 (delivered to Mr. Nalliah on October 15, 2004) by a pre-removal risk assessment (\"PRRA\") Officer. He hopes that this judicial review will evolve into a class action including as plaintiffs all individuals who received negative PRRA decisions made between December 12, 2003 and October 8, 2004. In this motion, Mr. Nalliah seeks an order of this Court:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (a) suspending the effect of all negative PRRAs decided between December 12, 2003 and October 8, 2004 until this Court has finally determined the validity of the PRRAs or until new PRRA decisions are made by an independent tribunal based on up-to-date information, whichever comes first;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (b) enjoining the Respondents from removing from Canada all individuals whose negative PRRA decisions were made between December 12, 2003 and October 8, 2004 and who still remain in Canada, until this Court has finally determined the validity of the PRRAs or until new PRRA decisions are made by an independent tribunal based on up-to-date information, whichever comes first; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (c) providing directions to all parties to the proceedings as to how they should communicate with members of the putative class.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[2] Also before me for the purposes of this motion were five other motions dealing with the same subject matter. Upon agreement of counsel, the Motion Record of Mr. Nalliah was used throughout oral arguments with the understanding that the results of this motion would apply to all six motions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[3] The background of Mr. Nalliah's history with Canada's immigration system is set out in brief summary form in Appendix \"A\" to these reasons. Appendix \"A\" also sets out a similar history for each of the other five moving parties. The Respondents advise that there are approximately 3700 people whose PRRA applications were decided during the period of December 12, 2003 to October 8, 2004 and who are, therefore, affected by this motion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ISSUES  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[4] The test to be applied when determining whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction or stay is the conjunctive tripartite test that has been set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Man.R.(2d) 241, and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Q.A.C. 241.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[5] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at page 305, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the same three-stage test applied to stays of deportation.Accepting the applicability of this test to the present motion, Mr. Nalliah must satisfy me that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 1. There is a serious issue to be tried in the underlying application;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 2. Mr. Nalliah and the other affected persons will suffer irreparable harm if the relief is not granted; and,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 3. The balance of convenience, considering the total situation of both parties, favours Mr. Nalliah and the other persons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[6] In this case, there are issues related to the proposed class action. There is a question of this Court's jurisdiction with respect to each of the elements of relief sought in respect of the proposed class members. That is, if I determine that the relief should be granted for Mr. Nalliah, am I able to extend it to all members of the proposed class?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[7] If I find that the requested relief ought to be granted with respect to Mr. Nalliah and that I have jurisdiction to extend the requested relief, the further question is whether it should be expanded to the putative class as it was in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 237 F.T.R. 87 (F.C.).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[8] Finally, regardless of whether the balance of the injunctive relief is granted, there is the issue of whether a notice should be sent to members of the putative class.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> BACKGROUND  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[9] This motion, the underlying application for judicial review and the proposed class action all relate to the placement of PRRA Officers within the structure of two government departments, the Departments of the Solicitor General (\"SGC\") and Citizenship and Immigration Canada (\"CIC\"). The allegations of the affected persons arise out of the following sequence of events:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 1. As of June 28, 2002, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001, c. 27 (\" IRPA \") came into effect and included s. 112(1) which provides that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"A person in Canada, other than a person referred to in subsection 115(1), may, in accordance with the regulations, apply to the Minister for protection if they are subject to a removal order that is in force or are named in a certificate described in subsection 77(1). <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> This provision is the genesis of PRRAs. The Minister's decision-making function was delegated to the individual PRRA Officers.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 2. For a period of about 17 months-from June 28, 2002 until December 12, 2003-the PRRA Officers were part of the structure of CIC within the department of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 3. On December 12, 2003, the Government created the Canada Border Services Agency (\"CBSA\") with the responsible Minister for the new agency being the Solicitor General (Order in Council 2003-2063, made pursuant to Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act ). Staff of the new agency were transferred from Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, CIC and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Responsibility for PRRA decision-making was moved to CBSA from CIC. This did not require a physical move of the PRRA Officers. For the transferred CIC employees, including the PRRA Officers, there was no change in existing terms and conditions of employment and Treasury Board continued as their employer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 4. A further reorganization took place on October 8, 2004 when the PRRA decision-making responsibilities were transferred back to CIC. Once again there were no changes to the physical location of the Officers, their terms and conditions of employment or their employer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ANALYSIS OF TRI-PARTITE TEST ELEMENTS  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Serious Issue  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[10] The first prong of the test for granting the relief sought is whether Mr. Nalliah raises a serious issue for trial. Mr. Nalliah submits that the serious issue for trial is raised by the lack of independence and impartiality of PRRA Officers during the 10 months that they operated within the CBSA.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[11] The threshold to be met by an Applicant for the \"serious issue\" branch of the test for granting injunctive relief is low ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 214 N.R. 146 (F.C.A.)). It is not the job of the Court at this early stage of the proceedings to evaluate the merits of the issue but to establish, upon review of the record and submissions of parties, that the issue is not frivolous or vexatious.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[12] In determining whether an issue meets that low standard, I should be guided by a review of any jurisprudence that may have considered this question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[13] This Court has considered similar arguments challenging the independence of the PRRA program while it was under the responsibility of CIC and has consistently rejected those arguments ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dismissing a stay application in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Dawson, in relation to a CBSA PRRA determination, stated that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Notwithstanding the low threshold, the Applicants have failed to establish that a serious issue exists. In this regard, the allegation of systematic bias has previously found not to be a serious issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  recent re-organization of the Canada Border Services Agency the evidence before the Court is to the effect that 'The PRRA office is structured in such away [sic] to ensure that the independence of the PRRA decision-maker is safeguarded'. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[15] Mr. Nalliah suggests that Justice Dawson in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , was addressing a different issue than the one at bar or that she did not have an adequate evidentiary record before her. I do not agree that a different issue was under consideration; in substance, the issue before me is identical.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[16] Mr. Nalliah submits that this Court has already found a \"serious issue\" on two occasions, citing <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  respect to one of those decisions. The Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , did not find a serious issue on institutional bias. First, the Court's Order does not reflect this and, second, the Respondent consented to the injunction motion solely on the issue of the threshold of risk involved in section 97 of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[17] This Court has also considered similar arguments alleging institutional bias while the PRRA program was under the CBSA, but found no arguable issue and dismissed the applications for leave ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dismissed)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[18] This appears to leave <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , as the only case where this Court accepted a similar question as a serious issue. The issue was described as \"whether the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment Officers enjoy a sufficient degree of institutional independence, having regard to the nature of the functions they carry out\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[19] The best law to assist me would be a decision on a judicial review where I could compare the facts and issues to the case before me. There is no such decision. Stay applications, being brought at the eleventh hour and argued on hastily written arguments, do not, in my view, provide me with much guidance. Given that parties have more time to prepare the application record for judicial review, the record with respect to a leave application is, accordingly, more complete and should present a full argument to the judge reviewing the application. Nevertheless, without reasons, or an opportunity to review the evidence presented it is difficult to assess the applicability of the facts in those cases to the one before me. Accordingly, while the orders of this Court referred to suggest almost unanimously that there is no serious issue, I am reluctant to use them to conclude that there is no serious issue here.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[20] I am left with Mr. Nalliah's assertions and representations that there is a serious issue to be tried. I note that there are significant problems with Mr. Nalliah's arguments. Among those problems are the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> - The CBSA is not, as asserted by Mr. Nalliah, only an enforcement agency. Its duties encompass administration as well as enforcement of certain of Canada's laws and, thus, extends beyond enforcement of removal orders.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> - The PRRA Officers have, since June 28, 2002 and whether in CIC or in CBSA, operated as a separate group without contact with removals officers. The PRRA Unit Coordinator directs the work flow and carries out the administrative coordination but does not direct the outcome of PRRAs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> - Parliament chose to include both enforcement and protection functions within the same statute with the Governor in Council having the authority to name the responsible Minister, thereby setting up a statutorily-mandated relationship between the two functions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> - Parliament also chose to link the removals process with the PRRA in s. 112(1) of IRPA and did not assign the PRRA function to an independent tribunal (such as the Immigration and Refugee Board), as it could have done.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 28, stated that, to satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness, the affected person must have access to an impartial process, appropriate to the statutory, institutional and social context of the decision, the evidence before me tends to show that the Government has developed a structure within which the PRRA Officers' function that meets this standard.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> - Jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  suggests that the Court should be reluctant to interfere with the executive branch of government's structure of decision making functions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> - By not bringing this alleged bias to the attention, first, of the decision makers and, secondly, to the Court, it is arguable that the members of the putative class have waived their rights to now raise this issue, some 10 months after the change to CBSA was made.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[21] There is one bit of evidence put forward by Mr. Nalliah that appears not to have been considered by the Court in the earlier stay motions and leave applications. That is the fact that, as of October 8, 2004, the functions were moved back to CIC. Would this have made a difference to the determinations made by Justice Dawson and others? I do not know. This move back may be significant in the context of the establishment of the factual basis for the allegation of lack of independence or impartiality. Further, I note that Ocean Port , supra, may leave open some question as to its applicability to decisions that may affect rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . In turn, that raises the issue of whether all of the PRRA decisions in question affect Charter rights. Mr. Nalliah and the Respondents disagree on that point.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[22] In conclusion on this aspect of the tripartite test, despite the problems faced by Mr. Nalliah and the members of the putative class, the question before me that may satisfy the low threshold is whether, during the CBSA period, the PRRA Officers used an impartial process, appropriate to the statutory, institutional and social context of the decision, to make PRRA decisions. On this low threshold, and on the basis of the record before me, I am prepared to find that there is a serious issue for trial.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Irreparable Harm  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[23] The second branch of the tri-partite test is whether the affected persons would suffer irreparable harm in the event that the injunctive relief is not granted. Mr. Nalliah argues that the putative class will suffer irreparable harm in two ways:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (a) Loss of their statutory right to a risk assessment; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (b) Unfair reduction of the putative class.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[24] Mr. Nalliah points to a number of cases where the Court has found irreparable harm because a claimant would lose a legal right or remedy. In support of his position, Mr. Nalliah cites, among others, the following jurisprudence:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the Court of Appeal found irreparable harm where the applicant's deportation to a country that would imprison him would remove the \"right to have the merits of his or her case determined and to enjoy the benefits associated with a positive ruling\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.), Justice O'Reilly concluded that removing an Applicant while the legal issue related to her PRRA was explored would render nugatory any legal remedy that might ultimately be available to her. These circumstances, in his view, constituted irreparable harm.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[25] Mr. Nalliah continues by arguing that, if this injunction is not granted and a breach of natural justice is found at trial, the members of the putative class will have lost their right to the single process that ensures in a timely way that they are not removed to face persecution, torture or risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Either they will have lost the right because the harm that they fear will have accrued or they will have lost contact with the Government.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[26] Mr. Nalliah must support this motion with clear and convincing evidence of irreparable harm. Irreparable harm is a strict test in which a serious likelihood or jeopardy to the applicant's life or safety must be demonstrated ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 9; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 191 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.), at paras. 12-13; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at para. 7; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at para. 4. Irreparable harm must not be speculative nor can it be based on a series of possibilities ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 68 F.T.R. 122 (T.D.)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[27] Simply alleging that the persons will suffer the harm they have claimed in their PRRA applications is not sufficient for the purposes of the test. I first note that the vast majority of the affected persons have received the benefit of a number of risk assessments. Prior to the PRAA decisions, in all cases, the affected persons have been party to earlier processes under the IRPA . Mr. Nalliah and the other five moving parties before me have all had reviews of their particular situations, including risk, by the Immigration and Refugee Board. Four of the moving parties have exercised their right to apply for a further PRAA pursuant to s. 165, Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations , SOR/2002-227 (the \" Regulations \"). Either in the initial refugee application or in a subsequent PRRA or other related application, the allegation of risk was dismissed in most cases. Most commonly, this was done by the Immigration and Refugee Board in the first instance and by a PRRA Officer or predecessor before the transfer of the responsibilities to the CSBA. Even eliminating those PRRAs that are in issue, in an unchallenged process, decision-makers have determined that most of these persons were not at risk. There is no evidence before me to show that the risk has increased since the first assessments to the point where the persons' lives are now in jeopardy. Any alleged risk, on the record before me, is speculative.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[28] Mr. Nalliah belongs to a small sub-group of the 3700 members of the putative class in that his first assessment was a positive determination by the Immigration and Refugee Board. The only negative risk assessment that he has received is the PRRA that is now in dispute. However, in the absence of specific evidence of irreparable harm, I have nothing upon which to pin a determination that he or anyone in his category of claimants would suffer irreparable harm.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[29] One helpful statistic that applies generally to all categories of claimants is that positive PRRAs are given in only about 3% of cases. This percentage did not appreciably change when the functions were moved to CBSA. Stated another way, 97% of claimants are determined not to be at risk. Absent person-specific evidence to the contrary, the evidence is that only a very small percentage of persons in the putative class would be found to be exposed to the level of risk that could result in a conclusion of irreparable harm. In my view, this makes the potential for irreparable harm very remote indeed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[30] The second branch of Mr. Nalliah's argument is that the loss of the right to continue the litigation constitutes irreparable harm. Contrary to these submissions, if the injunction is refused, their right to an effective remedy will not be rendered nugatory. As Mr. Justice O'Reilly stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 9: \"[n]othing in the Act or the Regulations interferes with the entitlement of a PRRA Applicant, who has been removed from Canada and who is successful on judicial review, to have her application reconsidered\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[31] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at para. 20, Justice Evans of the Court of Appeal stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Since the appeal can be ably conducted by experienced counsel in the absence of the appellants and since, if the appeal is successful, the appellants will probably be permitted to return to Canada at public expense, I cannot accept that removal renders their right of appeal nugatory. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[32] The cases of Suresh , supra, and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , referred to by Mr. Nalliah may be distinguished on the basis that, in both of those cases, there was significant evidence supporting a personalized risk. From a review of the jurisprudence, I conclude that irreparable harm cannot be solely founded on difficulty in pursuing legal rights of challenge once removed from Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[33] Finally, Mr. Nalliah argues that the integrity of the class will suffer since the putative class members may not know about the class action or may not be found once removed. At this very early stage of a potential class action, this argument is merely speculation. The process to convert a judicial review application to an action and to obtain certification is far from certain. Further, should this matter proceed as Mr. Nalliah would like, there is always the possibility of applying to the Court for an order requiring notice of the class action to be served, thereby curing the problems alleged by Mr. Nalliah.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[34] In conclusion, I am of the view that Mr. Nalliah and the other affected persons have failed to establish that they would suffer irreparable harm if removed prior to the determination of the issues raised in the underlying applications or to the trial of a class action.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Balance of Convenience  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[35] Given that the test for injunctive relief is conjunctive, the determination regarding irreparable harm is sufficient for me to dispose of this motion. Nevertheless, in the event that I have missed some aspect of irreparable harm, I will continue by turning my mind to whether the balance of convenience favours Mr. Nalliah and the other members of the proposed class or the Respondents.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[36] In R.J.R.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paras. 62-63, the Supreme Court discussed how they must balance the public interest and the interest of the parties. The Court noted:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"The third test to be applied ... was described as: 'a determination of which of the two parties will suffer the greater harm from the granting or refusal of an interlocutory injunction ... In light of the relatively low threshold of the first test, and the difficulties in applying the test of irreparable harm in Charter cases, many interlocutory proceedings will be determined at this stage'. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[37] An assessment of the balance of convenience requires a weighing of interests and the factors to consider will vary from case to case. As stated by the Supreme Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 85:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Among the factors which must be considered ... are the nature of the relief sought and of the harm which the parties contend they will suffer, the nature of the legislation which is under attack, and where the public interest lies. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[38] Mr. Nalliah submits that, if the Court is satisfied that where a serious issue and irreparable harm are made out, a balance of convenience will flow with him ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 55 F.T.R. 104 (T.D.). See also <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 58 F.T.R. 292 (T.D.); Suresh , supra). This final argument can be countered quite simply since I am not satisfied that irreparable harm has been made out. Even if I were satisfied, however, I believe that the consequences to the Respondents must be examined prior to making a determination on this branch of the test.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[39] In respect of this branch of the test, Mr. Nalliah's main argument is that the public interest demands that the PRRA process be a fair and impartial one. Otherwise, Canada risks sending people to countries where they could be the subject of torture or other severe consequences. In this case, Mr. Nalliah asserts that he is not just speaking for an individual but that his interests represent the public interest of all Canadians.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[40] Mr. Nalliah notes that he is not seeking to invalidate the entire PRRA process; at this stage, he raises no concern with respect to PRRA decisions completed before December 12, 2003 or after October 8, 2004. The Respondents can continue to process PRRA applications within the newly re-organized CIC.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[41] With respect to the 3700 persons who have not been removed, Mr. Nalliah argues that the Respondents, if they choose to proceed with removal, need only serve a new PRRA notice. In Mr. Nalliah's submission, while this will result in some delay, this cannot counterbalance the public interest in ensuring fair process.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[42] I am not persuaded by Mr. Nalliah's arguments on this issue. This branch of the test requires a balancing of the interests of both parties. I propose to do that balancing by considering the position of each party in the event that they lose this motion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[43] I will begin with Mr. Nalliah and all the other 3700 persons who form part of this motion. If this motion is denied, all of these persons would be subject to removal as soon as is reasonably practicable ( IRPA , s. 48(2)). However, as I have discussed above, the harm that could come to them is speculative. For some of the 3700, a further PRRA could be requested (although that does not result in an automatic stay) and that PRRA would be completed by a PRRA Officer within a structure that Mr. Nalliah has acknowledged meets his standard of impartiality. Others may successfully bring an application, on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, for processing within Canada. In short, the harm that Mr. Nalliah alleges is very uncertain. However, I agree with Mr. Nalliah that his interests extend beyond the individuals that are affected and a decision to remove him on the basis of a questionable PRRA may have a negative effect on Canada's international commitments and reputation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[44] On the other side of the equation, what will be the situation if the Respondents lose this motion? Contrary to the assertion of Mr. Nalliah, the evidence before me demonstrates that the impact on the Respondents and their ability to remove persons who have no legal status in Canada would be enormous. Some members of the putative class who will benefit from an injunction include individuals inadmissible to Canada due to criminality. Those who already applied for leave challenging their negative PRRA decision and lost, and those who applied for a stay of their own removal and lost (because they could not establish a serious issue or irreparable harm) will also be able to postpone their removal to some undetermined point in time. Bluntly stated-but without exaggeration-this injunction would severely and negatively affect the stated objective of the IRPA to protect the safety of Canadians and to maintain the security of Canadian society ( IRPA , s. 3(1)(h)). This is clearly not in the public interest.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[45] Nor is it just as simple as completing new PRRAs. While CIC and the CBSA attempted to prioritise and redo PRRAs for the 3700 persons to this motion, the ongoing system of PRRAs and removals would be severely disrupted. The harm to the Respondents is not speculative; I am satisfied that it would be an inevitable result of granting this injunction.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[46] When balanced, I am persuaded that the alleged negative impacts to the proposed class of individuals and, possibly, to a broader public interest if the injunction is denied is far outweighed by the negative consequences to the Respondents and the Canadian public interest if the relief is granted. The balance of convenience favours the Respondents.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[47] Having failed to satisfy two prongs of the test, Mr. Nalliah's request for injunctive relief will be denied.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> JURISDICTION TO GRANT REQUESTED RELIEF  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[48] Given my conclusion that Mr. Nalliah has failed to satisfy the test for granting the injunctive relief requested, it is unnecessary for me to address the issue of whether the injunctive relief sought is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NOTICE TO THE PUTATIVE CLASS  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[49] One of the requests of this motion is that I provide directions to all parties to the proceedings as to how they should communicate with members of the putative class. The effect of the denial of the injunctive relief in this motion is that the Respondents will commence removal of members of the putative class. Once removed, Mr. Nalliah is concerned that they may be impossible to locate. He has a valid argument. Even though I am not persuaded that the removal results in irreparable harm, I share Mr. Nalliah's concern that the integrity of the putative class may be seriously impaired without some way of providing information to those persons who are removed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[50] The Respondents point to my comments in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 250 F.T.R. 285 (F.C.), at para. 54 where I stated that requiring that notice be given to putative class members should happen only in exceptional circumstances. \"Such circumstances can arise if a defendant is dealing with the proposed class members in a way that undermines the integrity of the class proceeding itself.\" In Chen , the putative class members were permanent residents of Canada, some of whom were offshore. For those offshore, they would likely be in contact with Canadian visa officers to attempt to obtain travel authorizations to return to Canada. Thus, the putative class members could take care of themselves and the integrity of the proposed class would not suffer. Here, putative class members who are removed would not retain any ties to Canadian officials. Particularly for those who have no legal counsel, it may be unreasonable to expect them to learn of the class action. The Respondents bear no blame for this; it is simply the effect of removal. In my view, these are exceptional circumstances that warrant some form of intervention.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[51] In their submissions, the Respondents stated as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"In the alternative, if this Court finds that the possibility of the reduction of the putative class amounts to irreparable harm, and is therefore inclined to grant a 'class injunction', the Court could ask the Respondents if they would be willing to provide each member of the putative class with a 'potential class action information sheet' at the time of their removal from Canada. This information could contain the contact information for Mr. Waldman, reference to the CBSA website information where information on the development of the proposed class action could be posted. In such a scenario, no members of the putative class removed from Canada, would be excluded from choosing to participate in the proposed class action. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[52] Even though I am not granting the \"class injunction\", I believe that this suggestion has merit. Accordingly, I will direct that counsel to this motion work together to develop a protocol incorporating the elements in the above. A simple notice to persons being removed whose PRRAs were completed between December 12, 2003 and October 8, 2004 together with CBSA website information would be sufficient for notice purposes. The parties should report back to me within two weeks, hopefully with an agreement on the form of notice and related matters. If the parties cannot reach agreement, they may return to this Court for further directions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[53] To be very clear, removals scheduled for between now and finalization of these arrangements may proceed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> CONCLUSION  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[54] For the reasons above, the motion for injunctive relief will be denied.

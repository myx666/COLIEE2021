{"id_": "043935", "body_str": ["[1] Blanchard, J. [Translation]: The Attorney General of Canada (the applicant/the Minister) is requesting judicial review of a decision dated December 19, 2006, by a member of the Pension Appeals Board (the Board) granting the respondent an extension of time and leave to appeal the decision of the Review Tribunal dated November 27, 2001. The applicant seeks an order rejecting the decision and remitting the case to the Board for reconsideration by another member.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> II. Factual background  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[2] The respondent was born on July 12, 1953, is married and has a child. She has a Grade 10 education and worked as a fish processor from 1972 until November 1990.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[3] From November 1990 to April 1996, the respondent ran a nursing home in her home.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[4] On September 11, 1998, the respondent completed her first application for a disability pension. She stated that she suffered from severe pain in her back, hands and left leg, burnout, depression, panic attacks, anxiety and osteoarthritis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[5] On January 20, 1999, the Minister determined that the respondent was not disabled within the meaning of the Canada Pension Plan , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-8 (the Act ) and denied her claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[6] The respondent appealed that decision to the Minister on February 25, 1999. The appeal was dismissed on April 12, 1999.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[7] On July 22, 1999, the respondent appealed the Minister's decision to a Review Tribunal of the Board. A hearing before the Tribunal was adjourned to enable the respondent to complete her record. The Review Tribunal denied the disability pension claim and issued its reasons on November 27, 2001. The Tribunal based its decision on the reports of Drs. Nadkarni and Picard and stated that the evidence was not sufficient to support a finding that the respondent was disabled within the meaning of the Act at her minimum qualifying period of December 1996. The respondent did not appeal that decision to the Pension Appeals Board. That decision was the subject of the application for an extension of time and for leave to appeal that underlies this application for judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[8] The respondent filed a second application for a disability pension, dated May 7, 2004. This application, which is not in the Court docket, was refused by the Minister. The respondent appealed this refusal to the Review Tribunal. The hearing was adjourned on November 24, 2005, because there were discussions about an application to reopen under section 84(2) of the Act and about a new application for benefits. This second application is still in abeyance.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[9] On December 6, 2006, the respondent applied for an extension of time and for leave to appeal the Review Tribunal's decision of November 27, 2001, to the Board. On December 19, 2006, a designated member of the Board granted ex parte an extension of time and leave to appeal the Review Tribunal's decision of November 27, 2001. In granting the application, the Pension Appeals Board wrote as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [Translation] \"The Pension Appeals Board received from the above-named individual an application for leave to appeal the decision of the Review Tribunal issued on November 27, 2001. A member designated under section 83(2.1) of the Canada Pension Plan granted her leave to appeal on December 19, 2006, and came to the following conclusion:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 'Considering the claimant's illness and the steps she took both through her second application for a pension and her appeal of the Review Tribunal's decision in November 2001, it is clear that she has always demonstrated her intention to pursue her application for a disability pension using all available methods. An extension of 90 days is granted.' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> On January 26, 2007, the applicant applied for judicial review, asking that this decision be rejected and that the matter be referred to the Board for reconsideration by another member.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> III. Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[10] The issues are as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (A) Did the designated member of the Board err by not applying the relevant legal test for granting an extension of time?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (B) Did the designated member of the Board err by granting the respondent leave to appeal?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> IV. Applicable statutory provisions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[11] The provisions of the Canada Pension Plan that specifically apply to this case are reproduced in the schedule to these reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> V. Standard of review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[12] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Supreme Court of Canada determined that there should only be two standards of review, correctness and reasonableness. The Court stated that the standard of correctness must be maintained in respect of jurisdictional and some other questions of law (see at paragraph 50). When applying the correctness standard, a reviewing court will not show deference to the decision maker's reasoning process; it will rather undertake its own analysis. The analysis will bring the court to decide whether it agrees with the determination of the decision maker.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[13] The Supreme Court also teaches that in judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and law (see at paragraph 47).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[14] Guidance with regard to the questions that will be reviewed on a reasonableness standard can be found in the existing case law (see at paragraph 54). The deference that should be given to a tribunal will be determined based on the following factors: a privative clause; a discrete and special administrative regime in which the decision maker has special expertise; and the nature of the question of law (see at paragraph 55).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[15] In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Mr. Justice Kelen noted at paragraph 9 that the decision of a designated member of the Board to extend time to appeal or to grant leave to appeal is discretionary. He also determined that the appropriate standard to assess the decision of a designated member of the Board is correctness on questions of law, patent unreasonableness on questions of fact and reasonableness simpliciter on questions of mixed fact and law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[16] Although the administrative regime here may require the Board to have a certain expertise on questions dealing with the merits of an application for a disability pension, it does not, in my view, require such expertise to dispose of the question before us, specifically, an extension of time. I also note the absence of a privative clause.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[17] With respect to the nature of the question, the first issue is essentially a question of law since it involves determining whether the decision maker applied the right legal test in deciding whether to grant an extension of time. If it appears that an error was made in applying the correct legal test, the decision is reviewable on the correctness standard and will be set aside ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2006 FC 322 (Lexis), at paragraph 14). See also <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2006 FC 1364 (Lexis), at paragraphs 29 and 31. If the question turns on the assessment of the factors prescribed by the legal test, the question would be one of mixed fact and law because the determination would require the application of facts to these factors. Such a question is reviewable against the reasonableness standard.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[18] The second question seeks to determine whether the decision maker erred in granting leave to appeal. This is also a question of mixed fact and law since it requires that a legal test established by the case law be applied to the particular facts of the case. Taking into account the three factors set out  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the appropriate standard of review on this question is also reasonableness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> VI. Preliminary issue  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[19] On my own motion, I raised the issue of whether the Court had jurisdiction to decide an application for judicial review of a decision by a designated member of the Board. This issue was raised in light of the recent Federal Court of Appeal decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Mr. Justice LÃ©tourneau wrote at paragraph 43:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> In a nutshell, sending the parties to the Federal Court to have the correctness of a legal ruling made by a Review Tribunal reviewed on an application for reconsideration pursuant to subsection 84(2) does not find support in the statutory provisions enacted by Parliament. Moreover, it defeats the legislative purpose and objective of the CPP because the unnecessary diversion is costly and the claimant, whether he is the applicant or the defendant in the Federal Court proceedings, always stands at the losing end of this process: he bears his own costs of the proceedings, and possibly those of the winning party if he loses, and, in the meantime, the adjudication on the merits of his disability claim is long delayed. The diversion puts an unnecessary and unwarranted constraint on the fairness and efficiency of the adjudicative process put in place by Parliament .\" (Emphasis added)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> This decision reversed a line of cases holding that applications for judicial review of decisions by the Board be heard in Federal Court. Mazotta established that applications for judicial review of decisions by the Board, particularly those based on fresh evidence, must now be appealed to the Board ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In the case before me, the decision was not made by the Board but by a designated member of the Board, and it deals with an application for an extension of time and for leave to appeal. Mazotta , above, does not specifically address this situation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[20] The case law teaches us that there is a distinction between a decision made by the Board and one made by a designated member of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Lexis), Mr. Justice Pratte concluded at paragraph 2 that a decision can be reviewed by the Federal Court if it was made by a \"vice-chairman ... in the exercise of a jurisdiction which, by statute, is not conferred on the Board but on its chairman and vice-chairman\". This approach was confirmed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 223 N.R. 120 (F.C.A.) (Lexis) at paragraph 5. More recently, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Madam Justice Mactavish came to the same conclusion. She acknowledged the Federal Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to hear applications for judicial review in respect of the Board pursuant to section 28 of the Federal Courts Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7. However, she also noted that decisions of designated members are not decisions of the Board and therefore can be reviewed by the Federal Court. I concur with her analysis and conclusion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[21] I also accept my colleague's comments noting the difference in the respective mandates of a designated member and the Board. The Board is responsible for conducting a de novo hearing on the claim for a disability pension once a designated member has granted leave. The Board has no mandate to revisit a leave to appeal. Applications for leave and for an extension of time are interlocutory \"special\" proceedings since they fall within the jurisdiction of the designated member and not the Board. Judicial review of such decisions is to the Federal Court. (See Layden at paragraphs 24 to 26.)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[22] In my view, if the Federal Court of Appeal in Mazotta had intended to change the state of the law on this issue, it would have done so explicitly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[23] For these reasons, I am satisfied that in this case, this Court has jurisdiction to hear the application for judicial review of the decision made on December 19, 2006, by a member of the Board granting the respondent an extension of time and leave to appeal the Review Tribunal's decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> VII. Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> A. Did the designated member of the Board err by not applying the relevant legal test for granting an extension of time?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[24] Section 83 of the Act provides that a party who is dissatisfied with a decision of a Review Tribunal may, within 90 days after the decision was communicated to that party, apply in writing to the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Board for leave to appeal the Tribunal's decision to the Board. The Chairman or Vice-Chairman may then grant the applicant leave to appeal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[25] It appears from the wording of subsection 83(1) of the Act that a party who does not apply for leave to appeal a decision to the Pension Appeals Board within the prescribed 90 days must first be granted an extension of time to apply for leave. The Act provides that applications for an extension of time and for leave to appeal are made ex parte.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[26] Section 5 of the Pension Appeals Board Rules of Procedure (Benefits) , C.R.C. (the Rules ), indicates the information that is required on an application for an extension of time.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[27] In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Madam Justice Snider determined that the situation faced by a member of the Board considering an application for an extension of time is analogous to that of a Federal Court judge considering an extension of time for bringing an application for judicial review. Accordingly, the following criteria must be considered when deciding whether an extension of time should be granted:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (i) The applicant has shown a continuing intention to pursue the appeal;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (ii) A reasonable explanation for the delay has been provided;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (iii) The application for leave discloses an arguable case; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (iv) There is no prejudice to the other party in allowing the extension.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> The case law confirms the use of this test on applications for an extension of time ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 9).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[28] In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 10, the Court explains that it is critical in the interests of justice that the record demonstrates clearly that all of the above factors have been addressed by the decision maker. Provided that the record demonstrates that there was a reasonable evidentiary basis upon which the member could assess the factors, it would not be up to this Court to reweigh the evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[29] For the following reasons, I am not persuaded that the designated member applied the requisite legal test for granting an extension of time.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[30] In his decision, the designated member did not address the factors to consider in the context of the legal test that applies when a claimant seeks an extension of time. The designated member did not mention the test at all in his decision and did not deal with the factors listed above. The brief decision seems to indicate that the designated member granted the application for an extension for two reasons. First, the respondent had a continuing intention to pursue obtaining a disability pension and second, the delay in question was explained by the respondent's illness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[31] With respect to the first reason, the designated member did not explain the link between the respondent's intention to obtain a disability pension and a continuing intention to pursue the appeal of the impugned decision, i.e., the first factor listed in the test. Nor does the evidence in the record establish such a link. The evidence shows that the respondent was told about the time limit for appealing and that she chose not to take advantage of it. On or about March 30, 2005, the respondent completed a second application for a disability pension and exercised her right to appeal to a second Review Tribunal on October 12, 2005. Based on this evidence, it could be inferred that, since the respondent completed a second application for a disability pension and appealed the refusal to grant her this pension to a second Review Tribunal, she did not intend to appeal the Review Tribunal's decision issued on November 26, 2001. Although the respondent's actions indicate that she intended to obtain a disability pension, they do not demonstrate that she had a continuing intention to pursue the appeal of the November 26, 2001, decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[32] With respect to the second reason, the designated member did not explain what aspect of the respondent's \"illness\" could have justified the delay. The respondent states in her letter of November 17, 2006, that she suffered from very severe depression and exhaustion, had been sexually assaulted, had attempted suicide a number of times and was being followed by a psychiatrist. She maintains that she was suffering both physically and emotionally. However, the evidence indicates that the key elements of her \"illness\" already existed in September 2001, i.e., when the hearing on her first application was held. I note that her illness did not prevent her from appearing and testifying at the hearing. The respondent now wants to justify her delay in pursuing her appeal of the November 2001 decision by relying on this illness whose symptoms already existed. In addition, I note that she did not file a psychiatric report to support her arguments. Also, her \"illness\" did not prevent her from applying a second time for a disability pension in 2005.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[33] The evidence is simply not sufficient to support the finding that a reasonable explanation was provided to the designated member to justify granting an extension of time.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[34] The two other factors in the legal test set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , were not addressed at all by the designated member in his decision, specifically, whether there is an arguable case and whether the respondent would suffer irreparable harm. In the absence of reasons dealing with these factors, I cannot conclude that the designated member considered them. It is settled law that the decision maker must provide sufficient reasons when rendering a decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 130 N.R. 236 (F.C.A.) (Lexis)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[35] Overall, the reasons provided by the designated member in his December 21, 2006, decision are simply inadequate and do not explain what he based his decision on. The factors considered by the designated member cannot in themselves warrant the extension of time since the findings he made are not supported by the evidence. Furthermore, the two other conjunctive components of the legal test were not explicitly considered, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the designated member turned his mind to assessing those factors. In the circumstances, I can only conclude that the designated member did not apply these conjunctive components of the legal test. Thus, he did not apply the relevant legal test for granting an extension of time. This constitutes an error of law, which warrants the intervention of this Court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> B. Did the designated member of the Board err in granting the respondent leave to appeal ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[36] Given that my finding on the first question is determinative of this application, it is unnecessary to address the second question regarding leave to appeal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> VII. Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[37] For these reasons, the application for judicial review will be allowed without costs. The matter will be remitted for reconsideration by a different designated member of the Board in accordance with these reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[38] THE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 1. The application for judicial review is allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 2. The matter will be remitted to the Board for reconsideration by a different designated member in accordance with these reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 3. No costs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Application allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Editor: Anick Ouellette-Levesque/clh  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> SCHEDULE  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Canada Pension Plan , R.S.C. 1985, c.

{"id_": "003351", "body_str": ["[1] Rouleau, J. : This action arises out of a breach of a contract entered into between the parties on May 16, 1988. The plaintiff Shibamoto & Company Ltd., through its agent Ocean Fisheries Limited, retained the services of the defendant Western Fish Producers Inc. and the Ship \"Nicolle N\" to carry out a joint \"cash fish buying\" operation in the Bristol Bay Salmon Fishery off the Coast of Alaska during the 1988 sockeye salmon season.", "[2] On September 16, 1988 the plaintiffs commenced an action in this court by way of statement of claim seeking an award of damages for breach of contract by the defendants as well as wrongful seizure and conversion of the plaintiffs' property. The trial lasted twenty-six days and twenty-nine witnesses testified. In addition to the oral evidence, there were approximately 1,400 pages of documents filed on behalf of both parties. By judgment dated March 22, 1991, I held that the defendants had breached the agreement between the parties and the plaintiffs were accordingly entitled to damages for breach of contract. In addition, the defendant Jorn Nordmann, as well as all three defendant companies, were guilty of the tort of conversion. By order of the court, assessment of damages was to be determined at a later date.", "[3] The matter pertaining to the assessment of damages was heard by me on June 10 and 11, 1991. The total amount of the plaintiffs' claim (without any consideration of costs) is $1,427,847.29. It is the plaintiffs' submission that the sum of $1,186,353 provided by the plaintiff Shibamoto pursuant to the agreement between the parties was in the defendants' possession at the time this cause of action arose. The monies were never returned to the plaintiffs and the court has found that it was converted by the defendants. The evidence at trial established that $250,000 was returned by the defendants to the plaintiffs on July 10, 1988 leaving a balance of $936,353 outstanding which has never been returned. In addition, it is admitted by the defendants in paragraphs 16, 17 and 50 of the agreed statement of facts, that $250,000 was advanced by the plaintiffs on the mortgage registered against the \"Nicolle N\". This amount was never repaid in full although the balance owing was reduced to $172,672.48 after Western's share of the profit from the sale of roe was applied towards the debt.", "[4] The plaintiffs assert that the only deduction which should be made from the total monies wrongfully converted by the defendants is the amount of the profit share on the salmon to be paid to the defendants, which converted to U.S. dollars equals $48,665.73. Paragraph 6 of the plaintiffs' written submissions pertaining to damages states that: \"6. The profit share on the salmon payable to Western must be reduced by a) The commission payable to Ocean of 1.5% of F.O.B. value of fish actually shipped or $12,314.82; b) The adjustment from the tender advance of $.18 per round pound and $.25 per processed pound to the actual tendering cost of $.135 per round pound which amounts to $19,451.09; c) This leaves a net balance of the profit share of $16,899.82; d) Deducting this amount from the converted funds leaves a balance of $919,453.91.\"", "[5] The plaintiffs claim a balance owing on the mortgage of $172,672.48 as well as interest on the converted monies ($919,453.91) in the amount of $335,720.90. This interest is calculated using the prime bank lending rate. As a result, the total amount of the plaintiffs' claim to date, without any consideration of costs, is as follows: (a) Amount of monies converted by the defendants less the deductions outlined in paragraph 6(a), (b) and (c) of the plaintiffs' written submissions as quoted above (b) Interest on that sum calculated using the prime bank lending rate (c) Mortgage balance ($250,000 less Western's share of the profit from sale of roe applied to mortgage debt) Total:", "[6] The defendants also made a number of submissions concerning the question of damages. Once again it was argued during the course of the assessment hearing, as it was during the trial of this matter, that the plaintiff Shibamoto was not the true principal to the contract even though it was the party named in the agreement. Rather it was another, relatively insubstantial company called Muramoto, which did not have sufficient capital of its own to enter into the venture, but which exercised for its own benefit, the discretion given to the plaintiff Shibamoto pursuant to the contract. In the defendants' opinion, the agreement between the parties was a ruse since Shibamoto neither intended to purchase salmon and salmon roe for resale at a profit nor did it intend to divide those profits with Western. The participation of Muramoto, according to the defendants, was a fact which was never disclosed to them.", "[7] It has been suggested by the defendants that the plaintiff Shibamoto did not use its best efforts to obtain the highest market price for the salmon or the salmon roe as it was required to do in accordance with paragraph 3.04 of the agreement and that it failed to take reasonable actions in order to mitigate its damages. The defendants contend the law is clear that the parties to a contract are under a duty to act reasonably in order to mitigate damages and may not recover for losses which could have been avoided had they acted in a more prudent manner.", "[8] The defendants further argue that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover the costs of borrowing the money which it advanced to the defendants in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Those interest costs, it is argued, are not specifically identified in the agreement as being deductible. In paragraph 30 of its written submissions on damages, the defendants states that \"... Western was to provide the vessel and Shibamoto was to provide the money. Western is not entitled to deduct from profits its cost of purchasing the vessel and Shibamoto is not entitled to deduct the cost of borrowing the money.\"", "[9] This court is also asked to find that the defendant Western Fish Producers Inc. is entitled to be compensated for its actual tendering costs which the plaintiffs were obligated to pay in accordance with the terms of the agreement. These costs were fixed in advance of the Bristol Bay season by virtue of the agreements between Western and its tenderers. The actual cost incurred by Western to secure tender vessels for the Bristol Bay salmon season was $235,000.", "[10] The defendants argue that the contract rendered the plaintiff Shibamoto responsible for the payment of the fish tax imposed by the State of Alaska at the rate of 5.3% of the purchase price. Shibamoto, according to the defendants has not paid the tax in accordance with the agreement, with the result that the State of Alaska is now looking to Mr. Nordmann personally for payment of the tax. In the defendants' opinion it was and remains, Shibamoto's obligation to pay that tax.", "[11] It is the defendants' position that they should not be required to bear the entire expense of the roe technicians, two of whom were hired for two and a half month terms and two of whom were hired for three month terms commencing June 16, 1988. It was expected that the Bristol Bay season would conclude July 20, 1988. As no further agreement with Western for the services of these people has ever been made, it is submitted that all costs connected with the technicians be prorated 35/90 in the case of the three month contracts and 35/75 in the case of the two month contracts.", "[12] On the issue of the appropriate rate of interest, the defendants submit that, while an award of prejudgment interest would be proper in this case, the rate of such interest should not be the prime rate charged by commercial banks. The rate of interest must satisfy the principle of restitution in integrum. Since it is clear that prejudgment interest in maritime cases forms part of the damages, it follows that there must be some relationship between the interest rate claimed by the plaintiffs and the damages which they suffered. In this case, there is no evidence linking the prime rate of interest cited by the plaintiffs and their actual loss. According to the defendants, if the plaintiffs are awarded that rate of interest, they will obtain a recovery in excess of their actual losses. Similar reasoning is made in relation to postjudgment interest, which it is argued should be the current rate paid by the Royal Bank of Canada to its depositors so that the principle of restitutio in integrum is not offended.", "[13] Finally, the defendants maintain that Western Fish Producers Inc. is entitled, in principle, to a credit equal to its share of the profit which was actually made or which should have been made on the sale of the salmon and salmon roe. In this regard, it is contended that the whole purpose of the assessment of damages was to determine the profit actually made or which should have been made. The method of doing this is to determine which costs were appropriately deductible from gross revenues.", "[14] I have no hesitation in rejecting the defendants' contention that any losses created by the breach of contract were suffered by Muramoto and not the plaintiff Shibamoto and that the contract between the parties is somehow invalid because it was entered into under false pretences. This issue was canvassed extensively in the evidence at trial. At page 38 of my decision [43 F.T.R. 1, at p. 24] dated March 22, 1991, I dismissed this reasoning on the following grounds: \"I am not persuaded by these arguments. Shibamoto, the contractual party, is the plaintiff in this action ... The evidence clearly shows and it was understood at all times, that the contracting party would be Shibamoto & Co. Ltd. ... The funds provided to the defendants were the property of Shibamoto and the fish purchased by Western pursuant to the agreement were to be placed in the name of Ocean where they were to be held in trust for Shibamoto, until sold; it would at all times remain the property of Shibamoto. There is no doubt that all of this was understood by Mr. Nordmann when he entered into the contract.\"", "[15] Furthermore, it is admitted by all parties in the agreed statement of facts that the monies which this court held to have been wrongfully converted by the defendants, was provided by and was the property of the plaintiff Shibamoto. The evidence before me at the hearing for assessment of damages clearly demonstrated that most of the expenses in connection with the salmon were paid by Shibamoto. While it is true that certain expenses, such as the supervisor's travelling costs from Japan to the \"Nicolle N\" and return trip were paid by Muramoto, this is, in my view entirely irrelevant to the question which I must determine. It is not necessary to ascertain who paid the various expenses which were necessarily incurred in order to realize whatever profit resulted. Indeed, such an inquiry is immaterial insofar as it relates to an assessment of damages.", "[16] Neither am I persuaded by the defendants' suggestion that the plaintiffs failed to mitigate their damages or that Shibamoto did not fulfil its obligation to sell the salmon at the highest price possible. The onus of proving this allegation rests entirely with the defendants who provided no evidence to support their assertion that the total sales proceeds were lower than they should have been. On the other hand, the plaintiffs provided cogent evidence from Mr. Tashiro, Mr. Zoda and particularly Mr. Sugiyama, that the sales of the fish were handled in a manner fully in keeping with the terms and spirit of the agreement. Mr. Sugiyama, an individual with extensive experience in the industry, testified that he used his best efforts to obtain the highest price he could for the cargo considering its less than ideal condition, namely that the quality was not top calibre, there was physical damage to the fish, the grading of the fish was not accurate and there was chum mixed in with the salmon. Given the total lack of any evidence to the contrary, I can find no basis whatsoever to support a finding that the best sales price was not obtained.", "[17] I turn now to the question of the roe technicians. I indicated during the course of the assessment hearing that I was not prepared to follow the course suggested by counsel for the plaintiffs and deduct the entire amount of the technicians wages and per diem allowance in establishing the profit. Paragraph 4.01 of the agreement provides that Shibamoto was to provide roe technicians who were to reside on the vessel throughout the season. Subsequent to the breach of contract by the defendants and the conversion of the plaintiff's money, the plaintiffs removed the technicians from the \"Nicolle N\". The evidence shows that Mr. Zoda could not convince Japanese technicians to come to Alaska to process roe without a minimum guarantee of two and a half to three months of employment and that subsequent to their removal from the vessel he attempted to find employment for them but failed. In light of the circumstances, it would be grossly unfair to attribute the entire expense of these people to the roe operation and deduct that whole amount from the defendants' share of the profit. I am satisfied that the total expenses incurred in connection with the roe technicians should be absorbed by the plaintiffs, who in my opinion, acted impetuously by removing these people from the vessel when there was work for them to do and potential profit still to be made.", "[18] As far as the Alaska fish tax and the tendering costs are concerned, paragraphs 3.01 and 3.02 of the agreement provide as follows: \"3.01 Shibamoto shall pay the following items as set out below: (a) Eighteen ($0.18) Cents per round weight pound to Western for tendering costs payable on a daily basis when the salmon is offloaded to the tramper, upon receipt of both the mate's receipt and invoice from Western, based on fish ticket weight. The tender fee paid shall be adjusted to the actual cost of tendering the fish as soon as complete figures are available but in any event no later than July 29, 1988. (b) Alaska fish tax 5.3% percent of the purchase price, or such tax as is applicable, to the State of Alaska by July 29, 1988. \"3.02 Western and Shibamoto agree that after deducting all costs associated with handling and marketing commission of three (3%) percent, including but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, purchase price, tendering, processing, transportation, taxes, commissions (1% and 1.5%), insurance and marketing costs, the resulting net profit shall be divided equally between Shibamoto and Western or its nominee.\"", "[19] Attached to the agreement is \"Schedule A\" which sets out, by way of example, how the fish tax and the tendering costs were to be included in the total price paid by the plaintiffs to Western Fish Producers Inc. There is no question, based upon the evidence proffered during the assessment hearing, that Western has been adequately recompensed for its tendering costs and the Alaska fish tax. I am not prepared to make any adjustments in these amounts either in favour of the plaintiffs or the defendants. Accordingly, I do not propose to grant the plaintiffs request and deduct the amount of $19,451.09 from Western's share of the profit. Neither am I willing to make an order that the defendants are entitled to be compensated for their actual tendering cost of $235,000.", "[20] In the same manner, no order will be made pertaining to the Alaska fish tax. The defendants have been paid for this expense in accordance with the formula established in \"Schedule A\" to the agreement. I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have fulfilled their obligations pursuant to the agreement in this regard and cannot in any way be held liable for whatever outstanding amount may be owing.", "[21] The next issue is the appropriate date of currency exchange. Section 12 of the Currency Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-52, provides that \"any reference to money or monetary value in any indictment or other legal proceedings shall be stated in the currency of Canada\". The Federal Court of Appeal, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , held that this section precludes the granting of judgments in Canada expressed in foreign currency. Accordingly, the court must then decide at what date the currency should be converted with the two options being the date of the breach of contract and the commission of the tort or the date of judgment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Supreme Court of Canada held that the conversion of foreign to Canadian funds must be done at the date of the breach of contract. Although some trial courts in Canada have expressed concern about the fairness of the date of breach rule, the Federal Court of Appeal has clearly stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a case involving a very substantial fluctuation in exchange rates, that it is not open to lower courts to change the rule adopted by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, in the case at bar the award of damages relating to the conversion claim must be in Canadian dollars and the date of conversion from U.S. to Canadian currency must be the date of the commission of the tort which took place between July 1 and July 3, 1988.", "[22] With respect to the mortgage against the vessel \"Nicolle N\", the date of the conversion from U.S. to Canadian currency will be September 16, 1988, the date upon which the vessel was arrested.", "[23] I accept the plaintiffs' submission that the security provided by the bail bond and the cash payment made into court by the surety in the amount of U.S. $1,300,000, should remain in U.S. funds until the money is ordered to be paid out. On the date of payment, the funds are to be treated as equivalent to the amount of Canadian currency in accordance with the noon exchange rate issued by the Bank of Canada.", "[24] The parties have agreed that prejudgment and postjudgment interest is payable. This leaves only the determination of the appropriate rate to be used in the calculation of interest.", "[25] As far as the mortgage is concerned, I accept the plaintiffs' submission that interest should run at the contractual rate of the Seattle First National Bank Prime Rate plus 2%. This rate is established by the affidavits of Mr. Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the bank.", "[26] The parties disagree as to whether prejudgment interest should be at the prime bank lending rate or some lesser rate. The general principle in relation to an award of damages for a conversion claim and breach of contract is that the appropriate rate of prejudgment interest is the prime rate. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Addy, J., stated at pp. 314-315 as follows: \"It seems clear to me, however, that if one is to consider the right of the plaintiff to interest as a part of his damage under principle of restitutio in integrum, then, in order to be fair, the actual commercial rate of interest prevailing at the time should be applied regardless of what rate of interest a judgment debt should be at this time or what rate of interest any government at the time should choose to pay on monies paid into court. \"As a suitable yardstick and good indication of what would be fair, would be the prime bank lending rate prevailing at the time that the right to calculate interest as part of the damage arose. At the date of the accident and the date when the writ was issued, as well as at the dates when the expenditures for repairing the cables were made, the prime bank lending rate of interest was identical, namely 6%, and interest shall therefore be calculated at that rate.\"", "[27] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  court was faced with the issue of what was the appropriate prejudgment and postjudgment interest in the context of a collision claim brought pursuant to maritime law. The court considered whether the appropriate rate was the rate paid on monies deposited in court during the relevant periods or whether the appropriate rate was the lowest rate of interest quoted by chartered banks to the most creditworthy borrowers for prime business loans. At page 58, the following critical observation was made by the court: \"In considering the proper rate of interest to be applied in admiralty collision cases, it is important to remember that, unlike the common law where interest was not formerly awarded on damages arising from actions in tort, in civil law, following the principle of restitutio in integrum the interest on unpaid damages in ex delicto cases is considered an integral part of the damage itself and was always awarded as such.\" (Emphasis added)", "[28] The court made reference to the Federal Court of Appeal decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; (1984), 4 D.L.R.(4th) 546, wherein interest was set at the rate paid on monies deposited in court. In commenting on the Davie Shipbuilding case, the court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> made the following remarks at p. 62: \"What is more important, however, for the case at bar is that the Appeal Division of our court in its Davie Shipbuilding decision, far from attempting to set a hard and fast rule that interest should in all cases be fixed on the basis of some formula, made it abundantly clear and I quote that: 'The rate to be fixed in any given case as much involves the exercise of the court's discretion as does the decision as to whether or not prejudgment interest should be awarded at all.' \"I am far from convinced that I am limited by that decision to awarding interest at the rate paid for monies deposited in court. Urie, J.A., specifically stated that in the particular circumstances of the Davie Shipbuilding case, the method used in the rate determination in Jefford's case is the most sensible . There are many circumstances in the case at bar which clearly distinguish it from the Davie Shipbuilding case ...\"", "[29] There are circumstances in the present case which also serve to distinguish it from the Davie Shipbuilding case. First, in the latter case there was no evidence led, as was done in the present case, concerning what the prime rate of interest. Second, in the Davie Shipbuilding case, interest at the rate of 5% was claimed pursuant to ss. 3 and 14 of the Interest Act . In this case however, interest is being demanded at the contractual rate with respect to the mortgage claim and interest without limitation is being sought on the conversion claim. In Davie Shipbuilding the claim was for interest representing loss of income derived from certain bonds which had been deposited in court and forfeiture. Here the claim is for damages ex delicto, where the general principle is that interest is considered to form an integral part of the award for damages. Finally, in the Davie Shipbuilding case, monies were deposited in court with money accruing on the funds while in court. In the case at bar, while a bond was posted, the defendants obtained the interest accruing on the funds supporting that bond.", "[30] Having regard to the facts admitted, the evidence adduced at the trial of this matter and at the assessment hearing, as well as the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that the appropriate rate of prejudgment interest is the prime bank lending rate.", "[31] On the issue of postjudgment rates of interest, s. 40 of the Federal Court Act provides as follows: \"Unless otherwise ordered by the court, a judgment, including a judgment against the Crown, bears interest from the time of giving judgment at the rate prescribed by s. 3 of the Interest Act .\"", "[32] Accordingly, in some jurisdictions the interest paid on judgment debts is strictly fixed by statute and cannot be varied by the court. However, the Federal Court of Canada has the power to fix a higher or lower rate of postjudgment interest than that prescribed by s. 3 of the Interest Act", "[33] In the Algoma Central Railway case the court stated at p. 64: \"In my view, when dealing with an admiralty case, since the principle of restitutio in integrum must apply and since the interest forms an essential element of the damage awarded, the same principle used in calculating the rate should as a general rule apply to both prejudgment and postjudgment interest. In any event, because the amount is an important one and has now been owing for several years, there should be no indirect benefit accruing to the defendants nor any further loss suffered by the plaintiff by reason of any delay on the part of the defendants to settle the damages in full.\"", "[34] The court then fixed the postjudgment interest rate at 14% which was the average for the five and one-half years prior to trial. I am satisfied that the appropriate rate of postjudgment interest in the present case should be the average of the prime bank lending rate as it existed through the period from the date when the damages were incurred by the plaintiffs to the date of the assessment of damages. Here, the average of the prime rate from July 1, 1988 to June 11, 1991 is 12.29% as established by the affidavit of Mr. Kent Becker, Account Manager of the Royal Bank of Canada. That is the rate at which postjudgment interest is to be calculated in the case at bar.", "[35] For the above reasons judgment will issue allowing the plaintiffs' claim, save and except for the adjustment of $19,451.09 pertaining to the defendants' tendering costs. The latter amount having been deducted by the plaintiffs from the defendants share of the profits is to be added back in. Prejudgment interest will be at the prime bank lending rate and postjudgment interest will be at 12.19%.", "[36] The plaintiffs also seek an order for costs arguing that the circumstances of this case justify an award of significantly increased costs and that this is an appropriate matter for a lump sum award to be fixed in accordance with rule 344(4) of the Federal Court Rules", "[37] In general, rule 344 bestows upon this court a wide discretionary power over the award of costs with subs. 3 setting out a number of factors that may be considered in the determination of the appropriate quantum. These factors include the result of the proceedings, the amount claimed, the volume of work, the complexity of the issues, the conduct of any party that tended to unnecessarily lengthen the duration of the proceedings, the refusal of a party to admit anything that should have been admitted and any other matter relevant to the issue of costs.", "[38] In their written submissions pertaining to costs the plaintiffs seek the following: \"a) that fees for senior counsel at trial be increased over the amount provided in Tariff B to $500 per half day and junior counsel fees be allowed at $250 per half day; \"b) that attendances for examinations for discovery be increased over the amount provided in Tariff B to $250 per half day; \"c) that $250 be allowed for preparation for pretrial conferences and $150 be allowed for attendance at pretrial conferences, there being no provision for such costs set out in Tariff B; \"d) an allowance of five additional trial days for both senior and junior counsel to prepare, and revise the written argument that was required to meet the extensive written arguments of the defendants; \"e) a lump sum amount of $5,000 for the negotiation and settlement of the statement of agreed facts; \"f) that after the above costs are increased as requested, the resulting bill of costs be increased by 50 or 100%.\"", "[39] The total claim in this action was in excess of U.S. $1.3 million and the issues involved complex questions of fact and law as evidenced by the agreed statement of facts which was thirteen pages long. As mentioned, the trial lasted 26 days and 29 witnesses testified. In addition to the oral evidence, there were approximately 1,400 pages of documents filed on behalf of both parties as exhibits. The facts were exceptionally involved and many court days were of an unusual length often not ending until 5:00 or 6:00 p.m.", "[40] It is my view, that from the outset, the approach taken by the defendants during this litigation, unnecessarily lengthened the duration of the proceedings. The statement of defence and the amended statement of defence were lengthy, pleaded many extraneous issues, and raised a number of immaterial points upon which no evidence was presented at trial and which had no reasonable promise of success. In my reasons for judgment dated March 22, 1991, I concluded there was no merit to either the defendants' defence or counterclaim. Nevertheless, the effect of these pleadings was that both sides were required to produce copious documentation which led to drawn out examinations for discovery. During the course of these examinations, the defendants objected to many of the questions from which ensued a series of interlocutory applications in order to obtain the answers.", "[41] Other actions of the defendants have, in my view, added unnecessarily to the duration of these proceedings. It was proposed that, because of the complexities of the case and in order to save time, the issue of damages be severed from the question of liability. The defendants however, objected to the idea and the court was required to entertain a debate on the issue before an order was obtained. At the trial of the matter, vast amounts of time were spent on issues and arguments raised by the defendants in their defence and counterclaim for which no evidence was submitted in support. Often, the defendant's cross-examinations of the plaintiffs' witnesses were inordinately long in comparison to the length of the examination-in-chief.", "[42] The most disturbing aspect of this case however, lay in the unproven and sweeping allegations put forth by the defendants in their defence and counterclaim claiming fraud, deceit and conspiracy on the part of the plaintiffs. Generally speaking, courts do not condone accusations of this nature being made when there is a void of evidence to sustain them.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.), numerous allegations of fraud were pleaded by the defendants as against the plaintiff and the defendants by counterclaim. Besides complaining of fraud on the part of the plaintiff and her agents in the defence, the defendants repeated and expanded upon the same charges in the counterclaim, much the same as in the case at bar. Mr. Justice Bouck dismissed the claims on the grounds that the evidence came nowhere near to establishing the allegations. In allowing solicitor and client costs against those parties who had alleged fraud and failed to prove it, his Lordship stated at page 61: \"To falsely suggest in public that a person conducts himself fraudulently gives rise to a substantial award of damages in an action for defamation. In this case it not only imputes the plaintiff and the defendants by counterclaim are guilty of some type of criminal conduct but it also suggests misconduct affecting the defendants by counterclaim in their trade as real estate agents and salesman. Using the privilege of court proceedings to say the same false things should not go unpunished. Something more must happen to the guilty claimant than just a payment of party-and-party costs .\" (Emphasis added)", "[43] Similar findings have been made in a number of other cases where allegations of fraud, deceit and conspiracy were pursued but not proven.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 34 A.P.R. 52, costs were awarded to the plaintiff on a higher scale than would ordinarily be allowed, because the court was of the opinion that the defendants' failure to prove their allegation of fraudulent misrepresentation called for some penalty in respect of costs. In the same manner, the Ontario Court of Appeal in Bell and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.R.(2d) 78, approved a trial judgment allowing recovery of costs on a solicitor-and-client basis where fraud, deceit and conspiracy were alleged but were not proven.", "[44] I am satisfied, based on the defendants' conduct during the course of these proceedings, that this is an appropriate case in which to make an order for significantly increased costs. Accordingly, I will grant the plaintiffs the following increases over and above the amounts set out in Tariff B: a) fees for senior counsel at trial at the rate of $500 per half day and for junior counsel at the rate of $250 per half day; b) an allowance for the attendance at examinations for discovery at the rate of $250 per half day; c) an allowance for the preparation of pretrial conferences at the rate of $250 and an allowance for attendance at those conferences at the rate of $150; d) for the negotiation and preparation involved in the drafting of the agreed statement of facts the amount of $2,500; e) an allowance of $2,500 for the preparation of written argument.", "[45] In addition, I am persuaded based on the jurisprudence cited above that the defendants' unproven allegations of deceit and conspiracy on the part of plaintiffs cannot be disregarded. The defendants have persisted in these spurious accusations raising them in the statement of defence, the counterclaim, at the trial of the matter, during the hearing for assessment of damages and in their written submissions pertaining to costs. Indeed, the primary defence throughout these proceedings has been that the plaintiffs have been guilty of deceiving the defendants, leading them into a contract which was a ruse and which the plaintiffs had no intention of honouring. Furthermore, it was argued that the plaintiffs were engaged in some form conspiracy designed to injure the reputation and well-being of the defendant Western Fish Producers Inc. As I have stated on many occasions during my reasons for judgment and within these reasons pertaining to the issue of damages and costs, there has never been one scintilla of evidence offered which could in any manner be conceived as sustaining these charges.", "[46] Accordingly, I am prepared to grant the plaintiffs a 50% increase in their bill of costs after it is calculated using the foregoing increases which have been allowed over and above the amounts set out in Tariff B. Order accordingly. Editor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/blk [End of document]"]}

{"id_": "057636", "body_str": ["[1] Richard, J. : This is an application on behalf of the defendants for an order:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> a. striking out the plaintiff's statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> b. in the alternative, striking out the relief sought in paragraphs 1(b) and 19 of the statement of claim as being beyond the jurisdiction of this court to grant;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> c. dismissing this action as against the defendant, Pierre Gravelle, Q.C., the Deputy Minister of National Revenue, as this court is without jurisdiction to entertain this action against this defendant; or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> d. for particulars of the allegations in paragraphs 8, 12, 17 and 19 of the statement of claim and for an order extending the time within which the defendants may file a statement of defence in this action to 30 days from the receipt of the aforesaid particulars.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[2] At the hearing of the motion, counsel for the parties agreed not to proceed with the claim for particulars in paragraph d.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[3] With respect to the motion to strike out the plaintiff's statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, the argument rests firstly on an analysis of the statement of claim and secondly on the jurisdiction of this court to entertain this action. The defendants rely on rule 419(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules . Rule 419 reads as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"419(1) The court may at any state of an action order any pleading or anything in any pleading to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (b) it is immaterial or redundant,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (c) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (d) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (e) it constitutes a departure from a previous pleading, or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (f) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (2) No evidence shall be admissible on an application under paragraph (1)(a).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (3) In this rule, 'departure' means that which is prohibited by rule 411. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[4] Rule 419 and analogous provincial rules of practice have been the subject of substantial judicial comment, including pronouncements of the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.R.R. 287; 18 D.L.R.(4th) 481; 12 Admin. L.R. 16 and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.C.L.T.(2d) 1; 43 C.P.C.(2d) 105; 49 B.C.L.R.(2d) 273; 74 D.L.R.(4th) 321. The definitive judicial statement in this respect is that Madame Justice Wilson, for the court, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  as stated in the statement of claim can be proved , is it ' plain and obvious ' that the plaintiff's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action? As in England, if there is a chance that the plaintiff might succeed, then the plaintiff should not be 'driven from the judgment seat'. Neither the length and complexity of the issues, the novelty of the cause of action, nor the potential for the defendant to present a strong defence should prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with his or her case . <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[5] The defendants' motion record includes the affidavit of a legal secretary employed in the civil litigation section of the Department of Justice which attaches as Exhibit A thereto a true copy of the request for investigation filed by the plaintiff with the Public Service Commission on August 24, 1993. Also attached to the affidavit and marked as Exhibit B is a true copy of the decision and reasons of the Public Service Commission on the complaint filed by the plaintiff pursuant to the provisions of the Public Service Employment Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. P-33, as amended.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[6] At the outset of the hearing and as a preliminary matter, counsel for the plaintiff drew the court's attention to this affidavit and to its two exhibits. He objected to the admission of the affidavit based on subsection (2) of rule 419 which provides that \"No evidence shall be admissible on an application under paragraph (1)(a).\" Counsel for the defendants replied that the document was not placed in the record as a matter of evidence, but merely to establish its existence. He asserted that the document was introduced with regard to the issue that this court does not have jurisdiction to deal with this matter and because it supports one of the grounds of the defendants' motion to strike, that being that the plaintiff's remedy, if any, exists pursuant to the Public Service Employment Act and the Public Service Staff Relations Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35. Counsel for the defendants relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 687 F.C., in support of the proposition that an affidavit may be filed in support of a motion under rule 419 in order to determine whether the statement of claim should be struck out as pleading a cause of action which is outside of the jurisdiction of the court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[7] Counsel for the defendants also asserted that it was not necessary in a challenge to the jurisdiction of the court to proceed under rule 401. Counsel relied on the decision of this court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, there were three defendants: the Farm Credit Corporation, the Honourable William McKnight and the Farm Debt Review Board. The court allowed the motion to strike and to dismiss the action under rule 419(1)(a) on the ground that the Minister cannot be sued either in a representative or personal capacity unless the allegations against him relate to acts done in a personal capacity, and on the ground that the Corporation and the Board were not a \"federal board, commission or other tribunal\" within the meaning of the Federal Court Act . In his conclusion, Mr. Justice Denault stated at pp. 128-129 F.C.:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Although rule 401 was intended to deal with questions involving the court's jurisdiction and rule 419(1)(a) was meant to deal with whether there exists a reasonable cause of action assuming that the matter falls within the court's jurisdiction, a failure to set forth the correct rule does not defeat the substance of the motion ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.I.P.R. 312 (F.C.T.D.)). <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[8] It seems to me as a matter of practice that it is more appropriate to proceed on the basis of rule 401 when an objection is taken to the jurisdiction of the court. In considering a motion pursuant to paragraph (a) of rule 419(1) that the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action, the court must accept the facts alleged in the statement of claim as true and apply the \"plain and obvious\" test. There are no such limitations with respect to rule 401 and, in addition, affidavit evidence of relevant facts may be introduced in support of an application made pursuant to rule 401. There is the anomaly that a motion challenging the court's jurisdiction under rule 419(1)(a) may be heard by a prothonotary ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 485 F.C. (T.D.)), while such a motion under rule 401 must be heard by a judge. In my opinion, it is preferable to proceed under rule 401 in such circumstances.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[9] As stated earlier, on a motion to strike under paragraph (a) of rule 419(1), the court must assume the facts alleged in the statement of claim to be true. The plaintiff has made the following allegations in his statement of claim:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (1) that he was employed with the Public Service of Canada for a period in excess of 35 years;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (2) that he held senior executive positions in the Public Service and ultimately with the Department of National Revenue, Customs & Excise, as Assistant Deputy Minister, Corporate Management Branch, and his level was that of EX-04;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (3) that he and the then Deputy Minister of National Revenue, Customs & Excise, engaged in a series of discussions concerning his career aspirations and his continuing role in the Public Service of Canada;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (4) that these discussions led to the establishment of a position for the plaintiff as Special Advisor to the Deputy Minister pursuant to a Deployment Agreement, the terms of which were to involve the assignment of special projects to the plaintiff within his areas of expertise and interest, as well as career reappraisal and counselling;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (5) that on April 2, 1993, he was handed a letter that stated that his position as Senior Advisor was declared surplus, effective April 5, 1993, and that, if it should not be possible to redeploy him within the Public Service, he would be laid-off, effective October 4, 1993; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (6) that he diligently attempted to find new employment and to seek another position within the Public Service following his termination from the Public Service of Canada, which became effective on October 4, 1993, but that he has not succeeded in obtaining new employment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[10] The statement of claim then contains the following allegations on which the plaintiff's claim rests:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"17. The plaintiff states that the defendant Pierre Gravelle, on behalf of the defendant the Department of National Revenue, misrepresented material elements of the Deployment Agreement. The said Pierre Gravelle stated, or alternatively implied, that the Special Advisor position would be a mechanism for the plaintiff's career development and not as a career termination or outplacement arrangement. The said Pierre Gravelle further promised that a principal component of the position would be the assignment of special projects and the plaintiff states that there was never any intention on the part of the said Pierre Gravelle to assign any such projects. The plaintiff states that he relied to his detriment on these representations in that had the Deputy Minister's true intentions been disclosed to him, he would not have accepted the written offer of deployment and he would have remained in his current position as Assistant Deputy Minister.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"18. The plaintiff states that the Deployment Agreement and the offer of the position of Special Advisor and acceptance thereof on September 21, 1992, constituted a valid and binding contract entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant, the Department of National Revenue, Customs & Excise, and the said contract was breached by the said defendant in that no special projects were ever assigned to the plaintiff, the agreement was allowed to expire without discussion after six months in contravention of the understanding that it would be 'reviewed' at that point. Further, the agreement was used as a termination arrangement, when such is not the purpose of Deployment Agreements within the Public Service, and was not the agreed upon purpose of this Deployment Agreement.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"19. The plaintiff states that there existed no valid basis for the termination of his employment from the Public Service of Canada. In particular, the plaintiff states that contrary to the position taken by the defendants, the expiration of the term of his Deployment Agreement cannot constitute a discontinuance of function so as to justify a valid layoff under s. 29 of the Public Service Employment Act , R.S.C. 1990, c. 33. Accordingly, the plaintiff asks this Honourable Court for an order reinstating him to his former position as an executive officer (EX-04) with the Department of National Revenue with full reimbursement for wages and benefits accruing to the date of reinstatement.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"20. In the alternative, the plaintiff states that he was wrongfully deprived of the benefits of the Executive Employment Transition Policy which, as a term and condition of his employment, was his entitlement as a member of the executive category of the Public Service being laid off ostensibly due to the discontinuance of a function. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[11] Paragraph 17 of the statement of claim asserts that while the Deployment Agreement might have been in the Deputy Minister's mind a de facto career termination or outplacement arrangement, the plaintiff was, by negligent misrepresentation, led to believe otherwise and relied on this misrepresentation to his detriment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[12] Paragraph 18 of the statement of claim asserts that the Deployment Agreement is a contract between the plaintiff and Her Majesty the Queen, distinct from the plaintiff's employment relationship at common law and by statute, which was breached in its expressed and implicit terms and that the breach caused damage to the plaintiff in the nature of lost opportunities, lost income and general pain and suffering.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[13] Finally, the claim in paragraph 19 asserts that the Deputy Minister and Her Majesty acted outside their jurisdiction under s. 29 of the Public Service Employment Act by treating the expiration of the term of his Deployment Agreement as amounting to a discontinuance of a function justifying a layoff under the Act . Accordingly, the plaintiff seeks damages, a declaration that he was unlawfully dismissed from his employment with the Public Service of Canada, and an order reinstating him in his former position as an executive officer (EX-04) with the Department of National Revenue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[14] At this stage of the proceedings and considering the test which this court must apply, I am not prepared to find that it is plain and obvious or it is beyond doubt that the plaintiff's entire statement of claim should be struck for disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to support a claim of negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract. The potential for the defendant to present a strong defence is not determinative at this stage. Since the Crown can be sued and be found liable both in tort and in contract in a proper case and this court has jurisdiction to hear such claims, I also decline to strike those two claims on the ground of jurisdiction. As a result, I would dismiss the application to strike paragraphs 17 and 18 of the statement of claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[15] However, I am of the opinion that paragraph 19 of the statement of claim should be struck. In it the plaintiff alleges that the termination of his employment from the Public Service of Canada was not valid and asks for an order reinstating him to his former position as an EX-04 with the Department of National Revenue with full compensation. Counsel for the plaintiff accepted that in the employment context in the federal Public Service, the usual employment relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant is an employment at-will relationship with a statutory overlay. There is no contract of employment per se and there are no implied notice obligations. In my opinion, this court cannot grant the relief requested in paragraph 19 of the statement of claim. There is a statutory scheme for the review of employment-related matters found in the Public Service Employment Act and the Public Service Staff Relations Act .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[16] Further, I find that the claim against the defendant, Pierre Gravelle personally, does not require an existing body of federal law for its disposition. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 641, at p. 766 S.C.R.) It is based on alleged misrepresentations and breach of contract, both of which must be determined according to common law. As a result, this court is without jurisdiction over this defendant in the circumstances of this case and the action should be dismissed as against him. Accordingly, I would:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (1) dismiss the defendants' motion to strike out the plaintiff's statement of claim and dismiss the action herein;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (2) strike out paragraphs 1(b) and 19 of the statement of claim;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (3) dismiss the action as against the defendant, Pierre Gravelle, Q.C.;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (4) extend the time within which the defendants can file their statement of defence to 30 days from the date of this order.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Application dismissed in part.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Editor: Janette Blue/blk  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [End of document]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"]}

{"id_": "098567", "body_str": ["[1] [Translation]: Through a written motion made under rule 369 of the Federal Court Rules , 1998, the defendant asks that this court dismiss the objections made by the plaintiff during the examination out of court of Mr. Barry Kotler, the duly authorized representative of the plaintiff, Monit International Inc.", "[2] The defendant also requests that this court allow her to file a motion similar to this one after June 14, 1999, should one or more of the undertakings made by the plaintiff on the examination out of court of Mr. Barry Kotler not be fulfilled within the agreed time limits.", "[3] In the context of the present proceedings, this is an action in damages against the Federal Crown arising out of alleged unfair activities and misrepresentations made to the detriment of the plaintiff, Monit International Inc., in the context of an invitation for proposals for a lease to accommodate the officers of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).", "[4] The plaintiff is the owner of a building situated at 100 Sherbrooke Street West in Montr√©al in which the ICAO offices had been located since 1974; the lease, signed with the Department of Public Works, terminated on October 31, 1994. Analysis Objections", "[5] Objections were made in regard to two questions asked by the defendant: \"Did Monit ever consider putting a bid for this city site, I mean the east site? \"Do you remember, are there any documents you have, you still have in file that would show how Monit did proceed to determine the first financial bid, the figure you put in the first call for tender?\"", "[6] These objections were made on the ground that the above questions were irrelevant. In the case of the first objection, the plaintiff submits that the question asked is nothing but pure hypothesis, in that no proceeding filed in this case refers to any interest of the plaintiff in some other site and that this question is intended only to distract the court's attention from the real issues in dispute.", "[7] As to the second question, the plaintiff submits that the detailed calculation used in the preparation of its bid in response to the defendant's invitation for proposals is irrelevant since the rejection of that bid is not based on the proposed costs and, in the context of an invitation for proposals, no tenderer is required to describe its calculations in detail.", "[8] In regard to the issue of the relevance of certain questions asked during an examination or concerning the filing of documents demanded by one of the parties, this court has in fact considered the applicable test on several occasions.", "[9] My colleague, Mr. Justice Teitelbaum, reviewed these decisions in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.) when, at p. 359, he said: \"It seems to me that the clear right of the plaintiffs to have access to documents which may fairly lead them to a train of inquiry which may directly or indirectly advance their case or damage the defendant's case particularly on the crucial question of one party's version of the agreement being more probably correct than the other, entitles the plaintiffs to succeed on some parts of this application.\"' \"In the case of Reading &  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  discovery. 'The purpose of discovery, whether oral or by production of documents, is to obtain admissions to facilitate proof of the matters in issue between the parties. The prevailing trend favours broadening the avenues of fair and full disclosure to enable the party to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary. 'The test as to what documents are required to be produced is relevance. The test of relevance is not a matter for the exercise of discretion. The test as to whether a document properly relates to the matters in issue is that it must be one which might reasonably be supposed to contain information which may directly or indirectly enable the party requiring production to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary, or which might fairly lead him to a train of inquiry that could have either of these consequences. 'Usefulness of an answer must be balanced with the time, trouble, expense and difficulty involved in obtaining it.'\"", "[10] In light of these decisions, I find that the relevance of a question or document is reviewed with great flexibility and that, insofar as it is not clearly demonstrated that the question or document is completely unrelated to the issues in dispute, the witness must answer the question or the party must table the document.", "[11] In this case, having read and analyzed the amended statement of claim filed by the plaintiff on March 9, 1999 and the submissions by the parties, I find that these questions are indirectly related to the points at issue that are raised in the case. Indeed, in the case of the first objection, the defendant submits that reference is made, in the invitation for proposal documents of the Department of Public Works, filed in support of this action, to the \"[Translation] east site\", for the purpose of encouraging the interested persons to make a proposal in relation to that site.", "[12] As to the second objection, there is a reference in the amended statement of claim to the said proposal submitted by the plaintiff, Monit International Inc., concerning the architectural and financial representations made in the context of this proposal.", "[13] In these circumstances, I have no difficulty in saying that the questions put to Mr. Barry Kotler are relevant. I hereby dismiss, therefore, the objections made by the plaintiff and I order the witness to answer the questions. Fulfilment Of Undertakings", "[14] In regard to the defendant's second request, concerning the fulfilment of the plaintiff's undertakings, I find, after observing the record, that there is no indication in it that appears to suggest that the plaintiff has failed to comply with the undertakings it has made.", "[15] Accordingly, I conclude that, in view of the hypothetical and speculative nature of this request, I am unable to allow it since it is clearly premature. Thus, to the degree that the undertakings are not in fact fulfilled, the defendant may then ask this court to extend or amend the deadlines for the filing of the undertakings that have been made. Conclusion", "[16] I dismiss objections numbers 6 and 7 as recorded in the transcript of the examination filed herein and I therefore order Mr. Barry Kotler, the duly authorized representative of the plaintiff, to answer the said questions that were the subject of the objections.", "[17] I dismiss the defendant's request for leave to file a similar motion herein after June 14, 1999, should one or more of the undertakings made prove insufficient and it is necessary to ask this court to order the witness, Mr. Barry Kotler, to provide the requisite undertakings or clarify his answers.", "[18] Costs to follow the event. Order accordingly. Editor: Janette Blue/saf Footnote 1. (1993), 72 F.T.R. 39."]}

{"id_": "080121", "body_str": ["[1] : This application is for the judicial review of a decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\"the Commission\"), dated September 23, 1994, dismissing the applicant's complaint against the Commission and the respondent Harvey Goldberg (\"Mr. Goldberg\"), pursuant to s. 44(3)(b)(i) of the Canadian Human Rights Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended, (\"the Act \"). Part I - Facts", "[2] The applicant is a Canadian citizen of Aboriginal origin (Status Indian). In November 1990, he was seconded to the Commission from the Public Service Commission for a six month period. During his secondment, Mr. Miller worked as a Policy Analyst in the Policy and Planning Branch of the Commission under the supervision of Mr. Goldberg. His secondment was ultimately extended to March 1993, when it ended and he returned to the Public Service Commission.", "[3] On August 24, 1993, the applicant filed a formal complaint with the Commission against both the Commission and Mr. Goldberg personally alleging that the Commission discriminated against him by terminating his employment because of his race, colour, national and ethnic origin in violation of s. 7 of the Act . The applicant also alleged that both respondents engaged in systemic discrimination against Aboriginal persons contrary to ss. 10 and 14 of the Act . The applicant claimed that it was essential that his complaint be investigated by an Aboriginal person.", "[4] Upon receiving the complaint, the Commission appointed an outside investigator, Mr. Kie Delgaty, who investigated the complaint. Mr. Delgaty is an employee of the Ontario Human Rights Commission with considerable experience in the field of human rights and who has also worked extensively with Aboriginal people. On May 13, 1994, he completed his investigative report recommending that the Commission dismiss the complaint on the ground that the allegations of discrimination were unfounded. More specifically, he found that \"There is no evidence to support the allegations that the complainant was treated differently because of his race in the manner in which he was recruited, in the way his performance was reviewed and in the repeated renewal of his secondment agreement\".", "[5] By letter dated May 30, 1994, addressed to the Chief Commissioner, the applicant requested that an Aboriginal Commission member be present when the Commission consider his complaint. He also requested that neither the Chief Commissioner nor the Deputy Chief Commissioner take part in deciding on it. The response from the Commission was that there was no Aboriginal members on the Commission at the time, but that his complaint would be dealt with fairly.", "[6] The applicant also requested copies of the witnesses' statements gathered in the course of the investigation as well as copies of notes from the meetings that the applicant had with employees named in the request. Later, the applicant amended his request to include all documents that pertained to his selection for, and termination of, his employment and to his complaint. On June 21, 1994, the Access to Information and Privacy coordinator of the Commission sent to the applicant some 464 pages of various documents. Some of these were blank pages, multiple copies of the same document and notes that were irrelevant to the applicant's complaint. The covering letter stated that the applicant's request for witnesses' statements was refused based on a Commission policy. On September 14, 1994, five days after the applicant's deadline for submissions, the Commission sent a few more documents but the witnesses' statements were not included.", "[7] By letter dated September 23, 1994, the applicant was notified that the Commission had dismissed his complaint because, on the evidence, the allegation of discrimination was unfounded. It also stated that the Chief Commissioner was not in attendance when the applicant's complaint was considered and that the Deputy Chief Commissioner, although present, did not participate in the discussion nor voted on the resolution to dismiss it.", "[8] I. What is the content of the duty of procedural fairness in the context of an investigation of a complaint, and with the decision of the Commission under s. 44 of the Canadian Human Rights Act ?;", "[9] II. In the case at bar, was a reasonable apprehension of bias created by virtue of the Commission's appointment of an independent non-Aboriginal investigator, pursuant to s. 43(1) of the Act , and its subsequent decision to dismiss the applicant's complaint pursuant to s. 44(3)(b)(i)?;", "[10] III. In the case at bar, was the information provided to the applicant for the preparation of his response to the investigative report in compliance with the principles of procedural fairness? Part III - The Law And The Jurisprudence 1 - Dut y Of Procedural Fairness A) Complaint Resolution Procedure Under The Act", "[11] Section 40(1) of the Act provides that complaints may be filed by any individual or group of individuals having reasonable grounds for believing that a person has engaged in a discriminatory practice. Thus, an employee of the Commission is included. Under s. 41, the Commission is obligated to deal with complaints over which it has jurisdiction and which are not frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith. Section 43 provides that the Commission may designate an \"investigator\" who shall investigate a complaint in a manner authorized by regulations (no regulations have been promulgated as yet). Section 44(1) stipulates that the investigator shall, after the conclusion of an investigation, submit to the Commission a report of his findings. Under section 44(3), the Commission is obligated to dismiss the complaint if satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry into the complaint is not warranted. Alternatively, it may request the President of the Human Rights Tribunal Panel to appoint a Human Rights Tribunal (\"the Tribunal\"), in accordance with s. 49, to inquire into the complaint when satisfied that the circumstances so warrant.", "[12] Thus, section 44(3) confers a very broad discretion on the Commission to either dismiss a complaint or refer it to a Tribunal. As master of its own process, the Commission is mandated to weigh the evidence and to determine whether there is a reasonable basis for proceeding to the next stage ( Syndicat des employés de production du Québec et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 385, at p. 899). In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision, the Supreme Court has held that such a determination is part of the \"investigatory\" or \"administrative\" phase of the processing of a complaint and thus is not required to be made on a \"judicial\" or \"quasi-judicial\" basis. The Commission does not have to follow the whole panoply of the formal rules of natural justice, but it must adhere to the rules of procedural fairness in carrying out its determination. The Commission must inform the parties of the substance of the evidence secured by the investigator which was placed before the Commission. It must also provide the parties with the opportunity to respond and make all relevant representations.", "[13] The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision has been followed and expanded upon by several Federal Court decisions [see footnote 1]. These decisions are to the effect that procedural fairness requires that the Commission have an adequate and fair basis upon which to evaluate whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant the appointment of a Tribunal. The investigations conducted by the investigator prior to the decision must satisfy at least two conditions: neutrality and thoroughness. In other words, the investigation must be conducted in a manner which cannot be characterized as biased or unfair and the investigation must be thorough in the sense that it must be mindful of the various interests of the parties involved. There is no obligation placed upon the investigator to interview each and every person suggested by the parties. The investigator's report need not address each and every alleged incident of discrimination, specially where the parties will have an opportunity to fill gaps by way of response. B - The Standard Of Review", "[14] The jurisprudence [see footnote 2] has clearly established that the Courts ought not to interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a statutory authority merely because the Court, faced with the same evidence, might have exercised its discretion in a different manner. This reluctance to interfere is based largely on the notion that such authorities by virtue of their training, experience, knowledge and expertise are better suited than the judiciary to exercise these powers. Where a statutory discretion has been exercised in good faith and where reliance has not been placed upon considerations irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose, the Courts ought not to interfere. However, they may review the exercise of a discretionary power where such power has been exercised in a discriminatory, unfair, capricious or unreasonable manner.", "[15] Case law [see footnote 3] clearly sets out that the Commission must be master of its own procedure and that judicial review of an allegedly deficient investigation or decision is only warranted where such investigation or decision is clearly deficient.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 176, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that \"while upholding the rule that the fundamental principles of justice must be respected, it is important to refrain from imposing a code of procedure upon an entity which the law has sought to make master of its own procedure\".", "[16] In my view, there is no evidence that the principles of procedural fairness were not adhered to by the Commission in the instant case. II - Reasonable Apprehension Of Bias A) The Basic Test", "[17] The principles of fairness apply to all parties in any determination by the Commission under s. 44 and it is common ground that the Commission is bound by and must adhere to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (\"the Charter \"). The basic test to insure fairness and to avoid a reasonable apprehension of bias has been enshrined in the jurisprudence [see footnote 4]: it is whether reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information, would perceive bias on the part of an adjudicator. The grounds of apprehension must be substantial. Mere suspicions are not sufficient. B - The Selection Of An Investigator", "[18] Since no regulations todate have been promulgated under s. 43(4) with reference to the appointment of an investigator, the appointment remains purely in the discretion of the Commission. There are no provisions in the Act granting a complainant the right to influence the selection of the investigator. To give him such a right would run counter to Canada's multicultural and multiracial heritage and would, in effect, result in the imposition of inequality. In short, there is no basis in law for the proposition that an investigator under the Act must be of a specific racial background. To allow a complainant to choose the race or ethnic origin of the investigator would give rise to an apprehension of bias favouring the complainant, thus a clear violation of the duty of procedural fairness owed to persons (such as the respondent Mr. Goldberg) against whom a complaint of discrimination is made.", "[19] There are exceptions to the well-known maxim \"nemo debet esse judex in propria causa\" (no man ought to be a judge in his own cause), namely where a validly constituted statute allows for such a situation (see Barry and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 241, at p. 309). In the instance case, the Act in question provides that the administration and implementation of its provisions rest exclusively in the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  investigator. Section 44 provides that the Commission may forward a complaint to a Tribunal or shall dismiss it. The power is vested exclusively in the Commission and the latter may not delegate its power to another body. Thus, it is a statutory exemption to the nemo judex maxim. It is also an application of the doctrine of necessity: since the Commission is required \"ex necessitate\" to carry out the legal requirements of the Act , it may not be disqualified from acting by reason of an apprehension of bias. In other words, it may be the judge in its own case because it has to be [see footnote 5]. The applicant does not challenge that proposition.", "[20] Moreover, an applicant who is also an employee of the Commission, may not rely upon that special circumstance to by-pass the appointment of an investigator and go directly to a Tribunal. Under ss. 44(3) and 49(1), the Commission may appoint a Tribunal only if it is satisfied that an inquiry into the complaint is warranted [see footnote 6]. It would clearly be contrary to the intent of the statute and in excess of its jurisdiction for the Commission to accord its own employees privileged treatment by automatic referral of their complaints to a Tribunal when this special treatment is not enjoyed by other complainants.", "[21] In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, my colleague Pinard, J., specifically held that the Commission could, and was mandated to, consider and deal with complaints pursuant to s. 44 of the Act even where the complainant was one of its own employees. Moreover, the learned judge emphasized that in such cases, the Act does not require the automatic referral of the complaint to a Tribunal.", "[22] I agree with the submission of counsel for Mr. Goldberg that it would be unfair to his client and constitute a violation of s. 7 of the Charter were the Court to find that complaints of employees of the Commission must automatically be referred to a Tribunal regardless of their merit. In this particular case, the respondent Goldberg would be called upon to defend himself before the Tribunal in the absence of a substantive determination as to whether a hearing was warranted.", "[23] I find, therefore, that a reasonable apprehension of bias was not created by the appointment of an independent non-Aboriginal investigator. III - Duty Of Disclosure", "[24] The fundamental rule of procedural fairness, as defined by Lord Denning in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Canada in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision [see footnote 7], bears reproduction: \"... The fundamental rule is that, if a person may be subjected to pains or penalties, or be exposed to prosecution or proceedings, or deprived of remedies or redress, or in some such way adversely affected by the investigation and report, then he should be told the case made against him and be afforded a fair opportunity of answering it. The investigating body is, however, the master of its own procedure. It need not hold a hearing. It can do everything in writing. It need not allow lawyers. It need not put every detail of the case against a man. Suffice it if the broad grounds are given. It need not name its informants. It can give the substance only ...\"", "[25] The rule of procedural fairness requires that a complainant know the substance of the case against him or her. The complainant is not entitled to every detail but he should be informed of the broad grounds of the case [see footnote 8]. The complainant is not entitled to the investigator's notes of interviews or the statements obtained from persons interviewed. He must be informed of the substance of the case and he has every right to expect that the investigator's report fully and fairly summarize the evidence obtained in the course of his investigation [see footnote 9]. He must be given the opportunity to respond. He is also entitled to the disclosure of an opposing party's comments when those comments contain facts which differ from those set out in the investigative report [see footnote 10]. In order to constitute a reviewable error, the complainant must demonstrate that the information was wrongly withheld and that such information is fundamental to the outcome of the case [see footnote 11].", "[26] In the case at bar, although the applicant did not obtain all the documents he sought, he was clearly informed of the substance of the case in compliance with the principles of procedural fairness. And he was given the opportunity to respond. IV - Disposition", "[27] The application is dismissed. Application dismissed. Editor: Reginald W.

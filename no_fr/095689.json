{"id_": "095689", "body_str": ["[1] McNair, J. : Shortly stated, the issue in the case is whether this court has statutory jurisdiction to entertain claims, sounding in both contract and tort, against the individual defendants, Brian Gillis and Ronald Manderson, \"for acting outside the scope of their employment\" as fisheries officers appointed under the authority of the Fisheries Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14.", "[2] The said defendants filed a motion for leave to file a conditional appearance for the purpose of objecting to the court's jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claims against them and for an order staying the proceedings until the preliminary jurisdictional objection had been disposed of. An order in that behalf was made by the senior prothonotary, Jacques Lefebvre, Esq., on September 20, 1989. The order provided as well that counsel for the parties arrange a hearing to dispose of the preliminary objection to jurisdiction, which was done. The defendants filed their conditional appearance on October 3, 1989.", "[3] In 1981 the Department of Fisheries and Oceans implemented a scheme or program to buy back commercial salmon fishing licences in New Brunswick. Terms and conditions were prescribed for obtaining commercial salmon fishing licences in 1982. These eventually became part of the 1982 Atlantic Salmon Management Plan -- Scotia-Fundy Region (the \"Plan\"). The gist of the plaintiff's complaint against the two fisheries officers, Gillis and Manderson, is that they misrepresented to him that two licensed commercial fishermen could not lawfully fish out of the same boat, which had been the plaintiff's practice for many years. The plaintiff alleges that he was thereby induced to sell or surrender his commercial fishing licence to the Department at a price greatly below what he could have eventually obtained. Seemingly, the alleged condition against two commercial licenceholders fishing out of the same boat was not incorporated in the Plan or recognized as official departmental policy, nor was it ever enforced as such in 1982 or subsequent years.", "[4] Section 17(5)(b) of the Federal Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, reads as follows: \"17(5) The Trial Division has concurrent original jurisdiction (b) in proceedings in which relief is sought against any person for anything done or omitted to be done in the performance of his duties as an officer or servant of the Crown.\"", "[5] Plaintiff's counsel takes the view that this paragraph, coupled with the threefold test prescribed by Mr. Justice McIntyre in the leading case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , clears the first test hurdle of a statutory grant of jurisdiction. Indeed, defendants' counsel virtually concedes as much and I take it to be a matter of common ground.", "[6] In the ITO case, McIntyre, J., stated at page 766 S.C.R. the following three essential requirements for establishing Federal Court jurisdiction: \"1. There must be a statutory grant of jurisdiction by the federal Parliament. \"2. There must be an existing body of federal law which is essential to the disposition of the case and which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction. \"3. The law on which the case is based must be 'a law of Canada' as the phrase is used in s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\"", "[7] Defendants' counsel argues strongly that the mere fact of employment under a federal statute pertaining to fisheries does not satisfy the second requirement of the ITO case that there be an existing body of federal law essential to the disposition of the case which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction afforded by s. 17(5)(b) of the Federal Court Act. In support of this submission, he cites, inter alia, the following cases:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Fed. C.A.). Finally, defendants' counsel submits that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the third requirement of ITO, namely, that the law on which the present case is based be \"a law of Canada\" within the meaning of s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867. In his submission, claims sounding in contract and tort are not so integrally connected with any body of federal law in relation to fisheries as to bring them within the ambit of federal jurisdiction. In short, he sees a wide world of difference between fisheries law and the pervasive ambit of Canadian maritime law as defined in the ITO case.", "[8] Counsel for the plaintiff contends that there is an existing body of federal law, both by virtue of the Fisheries Act and the federal common law relating to fisheries, underpinning the statutory grant of jurisdiction afforded by s. 17(5)(b) of the Federal Court Act. He points out that the plaintiff is not merely alleging a violation of the Fisheries Act, conceding that this would be far too thin a cord on which to found and nourish the statutory grant of jurisdiction. Rather, he takes the position that the Fisheries Act in all its ramifications could not be made to work without fisheries officers such as these, against whom the individual claims are being advanced. In support of these propositions, he relies particularly on the following cases:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 161. In the view of plaintiff's counsel, the matter comes down to this. The alleged misrepresentations made by the two fisheries officers regarding the conditions for obtaining commercial salmon fishing licences in 1982 arose out of the Fisheries Act and Regulations and the powers and duties of fisheries officers thereunder. But for this there would have been no occasion to make the representations that are alleged to have been made. In the circumstances, the application of the law of contract and tort is essential to the resolution of the dispute between the parties and, in that context, such law comprises an existing body of federal common law essential to the disposition of the case. As for the third element of the ITO test, he asserts that there can be no doubt that the Fisheries Act is a \"law of Canada\" within the meaning of s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867 representing, as it does, Parliament's assertion of its legislative competence over a class of subject matter assigned by s. 91(12) of the Act to the federal domain.", "[9] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Indian band for a declaration that it had the right to use and occupy a certain Indian reserve and for a permanent injunction to restrain the defendant Indian band, which was the actual occupier of the reserve, from trespassing thereon. The dispute revolved around the determination of which band had the right to the use and occupation of the reserve in question. The plaintiff band alleged that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty to protect and preserve its interest in a reserve, which was and always had been set aside for its exclusive use and benefit. The plaintiff further alleged that the Crown was also in breach of the statutory duties owed to it under the various provisions of the Indian Act. The defendant band brought a motion for an order pursuant to the Federal Court Rules to have the action against it dismissed for want of jurisdiction in the Federal Court to grant the relief sought. The trial judge denied the motion and his order was upheld on appeal, but on slightly different grounds. The defendant band appealed the jurisdictional issue to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal, affirming that the Trial Division had jurisdiction to deal with the trespass claim against the defendant band. In reaching this result, the Supreme Court reiterated the threefold test prescribed by McIntyre, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  It was held, firstly, that s. 17(3)(c) of the Federal Court Act conferred the necessary jurisdiction. Secondly, the court took the view that the second and third elements of the ITO test overlapped, but went on to conclude that these had been satisfied in the particular circumstances of the case.", "[10] The rationale for satisfying the second and third requirements prescribed in the ITO case is reflected in the following statement of Wilson, J., delivering the judgment of the court, at p. 263 N.R.: \"I would conclude therefore that 'laws of Canada' are exclusively required for the disposition of this appeal, namely the relevant provisions of the Indian Act, the act of the federal executive pursuant to the Indian Act in setting aside the reserve in issue for the use and occupancy of one or other of the two claimant Bands, and the common law of aboriginal title which underlies the fiduciary obligations of the Crown to both bands. The remaining two elements of the test set out in ITO, supra, are accordingly satisfied.\"", "[11] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Court of Canada in the ITO case and held that there was jurisdiction under s. 17(4)(b) of the Federal Court Act (now s. 17(5)(b)) to enable the Trial Division to entertain a tortious action for false arrest and imprisonment against individual members of the National Parole Board. Stone, J., writing the court's opinion, concluded that the torts complained of \"depend for their existence upon federal law\".", "[12] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  without jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim against the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia based upon the latter's negligent and false representations which resulted in the revocation of the plaintiff's authorization to prescribe a drug. By the terms of s. 58 of the Narcotic Control Regulations, the Minister could only act \"after consultation with\" the College. The trial judge had held that this was sufficient to give the plaintiff's claim against the College the necessary foundation in federal law. The trial judge also applied the intertwining theory to bring the action against the College within the umbrella grant of jurisdiction given by s. 17(1) of the Act. The appeal from this decision was allowed. Hugessen, J., delivering the court's judgment, thus distinguished the Oag case at pp. 458-459 F.C.: \"The case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), relied on by the Trial Judge, is clearly distinguishable: Oag's claim was that the defendant Crown officers had acted illegally and contrary to a federal statute (the [R.S.C. 1970, c. P-2]) in such a way as to deprive him of a freedom to which he was entitled solely by the operation of another federal statute (the Penitentiary Act [R.S.C. 1970, c. P-6]). Thus not only did the damage which he suffered consist solely in the deprivation of a right whose only source was a federal statute, but the deprivation itself was caused solely by the alleged abuse by federal officers of their powers under another federal statute. A mere consultation such as is required by s. 58 of the Narcotic Control Regulations seems to me to be far too thin a thread on which to hang the jurisdiction of this Court .\" (Emphasis added)", "[13] The learned judge then proceeded to deal with the intertwining theory in the following terms at p. 461 F.C.: \"... it is my view that the concept of 'intertwining', which does not take its source from any words in the statute, is altogether too vague and elastic a standard upon which to found exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal Court. While the degree to which claims would have to be intertwined in order to give this Court jurisdiction is a matter which could no doubt be settled over time by case law, the development of the necessary rules would be a lengthy process during which litigants would be subject to continuing uncertainty as to which court they should sue in. It is not in the public interest that exclusive Federal Court jurisdiction should be a matter for guesswork.\"", "[14] In the Roberts or Wewayakum Indian Band case, supra, Wilson, J., observed at p. 334 (S.C.R.): \"The fact that a claim resting on provincial law is 'intertwined' with or affected by another claim determinable according to the 'laws of Canada' has been held not to bring the first claim within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Pigeon, J., at p. 713 S.C.R.\"", "[15] The Federal Court of Appeal again relied on the threefold test of the ITO case in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  conditional appearance and moved to have the plaintiff's action against it dismissed on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. The plaintiff claimed that the shipping agent had negligently misrepresented both the conditions under which the cargo was to be carried aboard the transit vessel and the extent of cargo insurance carried by the vessel's owners. The trial judge, relying on the ITO case, rejected the motion. The appeal of the defendant shipping agent was dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal. Desjardins, J., writing the court's opinion, after quoting extensively from the judgment of McIntyre, J., in the ITO case and reviewing other relevant authorities, held that the three essential requirements for establishing jurisdiction in the Federal Court had been met on the grounds that the misrepresentations related to a contract of carriage by sea and the agency relationship so created was comprehended by the broad definition of Canadian maritime law. The learned judge posed the key issue of the case and its partial resolution as follows: \"The key issue before us is therefore whether the law and the contract of agency as between a shipper and a shipping agent where misrepresentations as to the conditions under which cargo was to be carried aboard a vessel by the carrier and misrepresentations as to the extent of insurance carried by the owner and the manager of the vessel is so integrally connected with the contract of carriage by sea itself as to become either a matter falling into the class of subjects of shipping as this term is understood under s. 91(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867, or a matter necessary incidental to this class of subjects. In such cases, the law of agency would have a double aspect. Agency in its federal aspect would fall under federal jurisdiction. \"In the case at bar, the representations by the shipping agents both with regard to the conditions of carriage of the cargo and its coverage by insurance arose because of the existence of the contract of carriage by sea. There would have been no occasion for them to occur had there not been such a contract. It would be hard not to concede that those representations were integrally connected with the contract of carriage by sea and with the shipping operation itself. In such circumstances, the law of agency becomes 'a law of Canada' within the meaning of s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\"", "[16] The recent case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of s. 17(4)(b) of the Federal Court Act to entertain tortious claims of assault and battery and false imprisonment against individual R.C.M.P. defendants on the ground that they could hardly have committed the alleged torts without the authority and powers conferred on them as \"a member of the Force\", pursuant to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, an authentic law of Canada. I understand the case is presently under appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal.", "[17] The crux of the present case, as it seems to me, is whether the law of contract and tort and possibly unjust enrichment and fiduciary obligation and interference with proprietary right in the commercial salmon fishery, arising from the alleged misrepresentations of the two fisheries officers, bore such sufficient stamp or imprint of federal law as to bring the subject matter within the federal jurisdictional domain.", "[18] As stated, there is no question that s. 17(5)(b) of the Federal Court Act meets the first ITO requirement of \"a statutory grant of jurisdiction by the federal Parliament\". The next question is whether there is an existing body of federal law which is essential to the disposition of the case and which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction.", "[19] Section 5(1) of the Fisheries Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14, provides for the appointment of fishery officers \"whose powers and duties are as defined by this Act and any other Act of Parliament\". Section 7 of the Act gives the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans an absolute discretion, wherever the exclusive right of fishing does not already exist by law, to issue \"leases and licences for fisheries or fishing, wherever situated or carried on\", except in the case of leases or licences for terms exceeding nine years which can only be issued under the authority of the Governor-in-Council. Section 9 of the Act gives the Minister the right to cancel any lease or licence issued under the authority of the Act, if satisfied that the operations thereunder \"were not conducted in conformity with its provisions\". Section 43 enables the Governor-in-Council to make regulations, inter alia: \"(a) for the proper management and control of the sea-coast and inland fisheries; \"(g) respecting the terms and conditions under which a licence and lease may be issued;\"", "[20] Sections 49 to 56 of the Fisheries Act set out the powers of fishery officers and fishery guardians. Without attempting an exhaustive enumeration, I might mention some. A fishery officer may break open and search any building, vehicle, vessel or place, other than a permanent dwelling-place, if he has reasonable grounds to believe that any fish taken or anything used in contravention of the Act or the Regulations is concealed therein. Fishery officers are given powers of arrest without warrant, if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested has committed an offence or is committing or is about to commit such offence. It is made an offence to resist or obstruct any fishery officer in the execution of his duty. In the discharge of his duties, a fishery officer may enter on and pass through or over private property without being liable for trespass. Fishery officers may resolve disputes between persons relating to fishing limits and related claims. Furthermore, the Minister or any duly authorized fishery officer is given power \"to define the boundaries of tidal waters and estuaries and to designate what is the mouth of any river, stream or other water for the purposes of this Act\".", "[21] The locus of the plaintiff's commercial salmon fishing activity was Saint John harbour, the waters of which are tidal.", "[22] That there is an extensive body of common law pertaining to the public right of fishing in the arms of the sea and the estuaries of rivers below the ebb and flow of tide is beyond question. Nor can it be questioned that the federal Parliament has exclusive legislative jurisdiction under s. 91(12) of the Constitution Act, 1867 (formerly the British North America Act, 1867) over the seacoast and inland fisheries and that this comprehends the general power of enacting laws for the regulation, protection and preservation of the fisheries as a public resource, notwithstanding that such laws may impinge to some degree on the proprietary rights of others:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .", "[23] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Canada regulating 'seacoast and inland fisheries' all must submit, but such laws must not conflict or compete with the legislative power of the local legislatures over property and civil rights beyond what may be necessary for legislating generally and effectually for the regulation, protection and preservation of the fisheries in the interests of the public at large.\"", "[24] Attorney General for  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to authorize the provincial government to grant exclusive rights of fishing in tidal waters on the ground that the right of fishing therein was a public right and not a proprietary one, and that consequently the matter of its regulation rested exclusively with the Dominion Parliament. In that case, Viscount Haldane, L.C., said at p. 175: \"The principles above enunciated suffice to answer the third question, which relates to the right of fishing in arms of the sea and the estuaries of rivers. The right to fish is in their Lordships' opinion a public right of the same character as that enjoyed by the public on the open seas. A right of this kind is not an incident of property, and is not confined to the subjects of the Crown who are under the jurisdiction of the Province. Interference with it, whether in the form of direct regulation, or by the grant of exclusive or partially exclusive rights to individuals or classes of individuals, cannot be within the power of the Province, which is excluded from general legislation with regard to seacoast and inland fisheries.\"", "[25] In Attorney General for  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to grant the exclusive right of fishing in tidal waters after confederation, said at pp. 427-428: \"The Dominion Parliament, having exclusive jurisdiction over seacoast and inland fisheries, could regulate the exercise of all fishing rights, private and public alike. As the public right was not proprietary, the Dominion Parliament has in effect exclusive jurisdiction to deal with it. But as to private rights, the provincial Legislature has exclusive jurisdiction so long as these present no other aspects than that of property and civil rights in the Province, or of matter of a local or private nature within it, in the meaning of the words of s. 92.\"", "[26] Coming back to the matter at hand, I am of the opinion that the misrepresentations complained of in the present case and the consequences flowing therefrom were attributable primarily to the authoritative role of the individual defendants as federal fishery officers under the Fisheries Act and the alleged abuse of their powers thereunder, but for which the alleged misrepresentations would not have occurred at all. Consequently, I consider that the subject matter of the individual claims against them, viewed in proper context, depends for its existence upon \"the detailed statutory framework\" of the Fisheries Act with respect to the terms and conditions for obtaining commercial salmon fishing licences. Consistent with the principle of the Oag case and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , I am impelled to the conclusion that the claims are founded on the statutory base of federal law, namely, the regulatory and licensing provisions of the Fisheries Act and the administration thereof, and that this is \"a law of Canada\" within the meaning of s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867.", "[27] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  provided for the enforcement of a contractual obligation which owed nothing to federal law other than its origin in the statutory authorization to make the advance, said at p. 447: \"I do not agree that the matter can be disposed of in such simple terms. What we have here is a detailed statutory framework under which advances for prospective grain deliveries are authorized as part of an overall scheme for the marketing of grain produced in Canada. An examination of the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act itself lends emphasis to its place in the overall scheme. True, there is an undertaking or a contractual consequence of the application of the Act but that does not mean that the Act is left behind once the undertaking or contract is made. At every turn, the Act has its impact on the undertaking so as to make it proper to say that there is here existing and valid federal law to govern the transaction which became the subject of litigation in the Federal Court. It should hardly be necessary to add that 'contract' or other legal institutions, such as 'tort' cannot be invariably attributed to sole provincial legislative regulation or be deemed to be, as common law, solely matters of provincial law.\"", "[28] In my opinion, the body of statutory law in the present case is amply sufficient to nourish the statutory grant of jurisdiction afforded by s. 17(5)(b) of the Federal Court Act.", "[29] The case having been resolved on the statutory jurisdictional ground, the question of whether there is an existing and applicable body of federal common law \"to underpin the jurisdiction of the Federal Court\" becomes academic.", "[30] For the foregoing reasons, the defendants' motion is dismissed with costs. Application dismissed. Editor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/nmg [End of document]"]}

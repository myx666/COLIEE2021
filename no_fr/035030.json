{"id_": "035030", "body_str": ["[1] Teitelbaum, J. : This is an application to review the decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the \"CRDD\") dated January 4, 1993, wherein the CRDD determined that the applicant, William Kwame Ahortor, is not a Convention refugee within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the Immigration Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, as amended by s. 1(2) of the Immigration Act , S.C. 1992, c. 49.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[2] The grounds for the application as set in the application for leave, are as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 1. That the tribunal erred in law in its interpretation and application of the definition of \"Convention refugee\" as defined in s. 1(2) of the Immigration Act , 1988;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 2. That the tribunal erred in determining that the applicant is not a Convention refugee in that it made erroneous findings of fact without regard to the evidence properly before it, and that its decision was unreasonable considering the evidence before it;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 3. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court may permit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[3] The documentary evidence filed in support of the application includes (1) the affidavit of the applicant, William Kwame Ahortor; (2) the affidavit of Kristen Marshall, a lawyer working in association with the applicant's counsel; (3) the transcript of the proceedings before the tribunal and the material filed before the tribunal; (4) the written reasons of the CRDD decision; and (5) the memorandum of fact and law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[4] The respondent has submitted a memorandum of argument.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> The Facts:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[5] The applicant is a citizen of Accra, Ghana where he was born on July 8, 1962. He came to Canada on June 11, 1991 and claimed status as a refugee on the basis of political opinion and membership in a particular social group. On October 1, 1992, a hearing was held before the CRDD and in a decision dated January 4, 1993, the CRDD determined that the applicant was not a Convention refugee.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[6] This is a summary of the facts as they appear in the applicant's Personal Information Form (\"PIF\") and as provided in his oral testimony at the hearing. The respondent has stated that they adopt the findings of fact made by the CRDD as detailed in its decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[7] The applicant owned and ran his own business in Accra, Ghana. His father was considered to be an influential man who from 1968 to 1972 was the publicity campaign manager for the political party in power, in Ghana, at the time. In 1972 this government was overthrown in a coup by I.K. Acheampong. His father fled to London, England and returned six years later to Ghana after the Acheampong government was overthrown by the People's National Party (PNP). The father established his own insurance company, called Classical Insurance Company which operated out of Accra, Ghana.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[8] In 1981 the PNP government was overthrown by the Provisional National Defence Committee (PNDC). The PNDC remains in power in Ghana and is considered to be a military government with revolutionary-socialist tendencies.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[9] In December 1990 the applicant's father founded the Labone Development Club, an organization established to represent the interests of the business community in Labone, a wealthy district of Accra where the applicant and his father both lived. The applicant was involved in this group, which held meetings bi-monthly and attracted an attendance of between 100-150 people.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[10] The applicant's problems first began on May 20, 1991 when he, his father and the secretary of the organization were all arrested. The applicant was arrested at 4:30 a.m. by three plain-clothed police officers while at his home. He alleges that these men were members of the Bureau of National Investigation (the \"BNI\") the Ghana Security Service.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[11] The applicant was taken by patrol car to the Gonda Barracks, a military compound in Accra. Once there, he was brought down stairs, ordered to remove his clothing and his head was forcibly shaved with a broken bottle, causing him to bleed profusely. It was only after that he became aware of the reasons for his arrest. The applicant was told by one of the soldiers that he, along with his father, the secretary and other members of the Labone Development Club, were suspected of planning to overthrow the PNDC government.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[12] The applicant was detained for ten days during which time he remained nude and was whipped and beaten with the soldiers' guns. Specifically, on the third day of the detention the applicant was visited by a Major Boateng, who is married to the applicant's cousin, Afua Asiedua. The applicant contended that the Major has great authority and had the power to have him released or killed. The applicant alleges that he told the Major he knew nothing about the accusations. On the fifth day of the detention the applicant was brought to the \"Death Squad Zone\" and threatened with execution by firing squad. Finally, on May 30, 1991 he was released on the order of Major Boateng. This information was revealed to the applicant on May 31, 1991 by the applicant's cousin.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[13] The applicant's store had been shut down by the military. As well, it was not until his release that he learned that his father and the secretary had also been arrested and subsequently released on the same dates. The father's company had been seized by the government and renamed as the State Insurance Corporation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[14] On June 4, 1991 the applicant attended at the Canadian Embassy in Accra and obtained a tourist visa to visit Canada. At that point in time the applicant claims he was not of the mind set that he would need to leave Ghana in a hurry. He remained hopeful that his life would return to normal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[15] On June 9, 1991 while attending church, his younger sister, Jacqueline, came and told the applicant his house had been surrounded by soldiers who were looking for him. The applicant took a taxi to the home of his girlfriend, Teddora Asare, which was located near the airport. The next day he asked her to go to the home of the Major and find out what was happening. She did and was informed that the Chief of State Security, the superior of Major Boateng, had ordered the applicant, the applicant's father and the secretary arrested and shot for plotting against the government. The Major suggested that the applicant leave the country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[16] The next day the applicant's girlfriend purchased a same day travel K.L.M. ticket to Canada. Major Boateng assisted the applicant's departure. He accompanied the applicant to the airport and, before the airport security, the Major pretended that the applicant was his brother. Since the Major was the superior to these officers the applicant was not questioned, nor required to provide his name. The applicant boarded the plane and left Ghana.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[17] He arrived at the Mirabel Airport in Montreal on June 11, 1991. The following day he attended at the Toronto West Immigration Centre where he indicated his intention to make a refugee claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[18] The applicant claims that he fears returning to Ghana where he is wanted for the alleged coup plot against the PNDC. He asserts that since his arrival in Canada, he has learned through news obtained from the Major and communicated to his mother that his father was arrested on June 9, 1991 and has not been heard from. The applicant claims that in Ghana persons accused of crimes can be held indefinitely without a trial and if returned to Ghana he will be tortured as he had been before. At his hearing the applicant testified that people are detained in the night and not seen again. He also testified that there is nothing in the papers to report such detention and that the press is not free.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[19] He claims Convention refugee status based on his perceived political opinions as well as his association with his father.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> The CRDD Reasons For Its Decision:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[20] The CRDD determined that the applicant was not a Convention refugee. The CRDD found that the \"crucial aspect(s) of the claimant's evidence were not credible and trustworthy\" nor was the claimant's evidence borne out by the documentary evidence presented at the hearing. The CRDD based its decision on the basis that the story of the claimant did not have the \"ring of truth\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[21] Specifically, the CRDD doubted why Major Boateng would have ordered the applicant's release but not have any influence, merely ten days later, over the prevention of the attempted arrest on June 9, 1991. The board stated at pp. 5-6, \"it is highly unlikely that Major Boateng, being head of the BNI (which he is not), would not have known the seriousness of the reason for the claimant's first arrest by the BNI on May 20, 1991. If Major Boateng vouched for the claimant's release on May 30, 1991, in the panel's opinion, it is reasonable to expect him to do so on June 9, 1991, a mere ten days after the claimant's release\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[22] Another factor taken into account in determining that the applicant's evidence was not credible or trustworthy was the absence of documentary evidence or evidence to corroborate the applicant's contention that his father was arrested on May 20, 1991 and again on June 9, 1991. Nor was there evidence to corroborate the applicant's allegation that he was suspected of a coup plot and that the suspected members of the plot, the members of the Labone Development Club, had been arrested in May 1991. At p. 5, the CRDD states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Given the claimant's earlier evidence in his PIF that his father was an influential man in the Progress Party in the past, as well as a well-known business man (President and founder of the Labone Development Club) recently, he was asked whether there was any documentation regarding his father's arrest on May 20, 1991, and rearrest on June 9, 1991, from which time he had not been heard of. The claimant did not produce any such evidence, nor is there any such information in the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing. Similarly, there is no information in the documentary evidence presented at the hearing to corroborate the occurrence of a coup plotting to overthrow the P.N.D.C. in Ghana by members of the Labone Development Club and the arrest of those suspected of participating in the same in May 1991. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> At p. 6 the CRDD concludes:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Moreover, there is no documentation presented by the claimant to corroborate the occurrence of the said coup attempt and the subsequent arrest of the claimant, his father and one Adu-Ago in May 1991. In the panel's opinion, given the claimant's father's high profile (a past political figure, a known businessman, and president and founder of a large business organization in a wealthy district of Accra), the Ghanian community in general and the various human rights groups, in particular, would have known and reported the arrest and disappearance of such a person if this had indeed happened. For the above reason, the panel finds, in particular, the claimant's allegation that his house was surrounded by the Ghanian soldiers on June 9, 1991 not to be trustworthy. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[23] The CRDD also based its findings of disbelief of the applicant's story on the basis of documentary evidence before it which, in their opinion, contradicted the applicant's assertion of the manner in which political opponents, such as himself, have been dealt with in Ghana in recent years. At p. 6 the CRDD states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"The U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1991 - Ghana (Exhibit R-1, Item 2) indicates that there were no reports of politically motivated or other extra judicial killings or politically motivated disappearances. The panel therefore does not believe that the Ghanian Security Chief would, as alleged by the claimant, order the arrest and shooting of himself, his father and one Adu-Ago because they were suspected of plotting to overthrow the Ghanian Government. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[24] The applicant argues that the CRDD erred in fact and law when they concluded that the applicant's evidence was not credible. The applicant maintains that the board rendered its determination by misstating evidence, and failing to consider relevant evidence properly before it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[25] Specifically, it is submitted that the CRDD misstated the evidence concerning Major Boateng's position with the BNI and failed to correctly appreciate the facts. In finding the applicant's explanation as to why the Major had not vouched for the applicant a second time, on June 9, 1991, the CRDD erred in law by ignoring the applicant's evidence that this second order of arrest had been issued by the Major's supervisor. Thus, by basing its decision, concerning the applicant's credibility on an erroneous finding of fact made without regard to the evidence before it, the CRDD erred in law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[26] Moreover, the applicant contends that the CRDD erred in law when they concluded, based on the lack of corroborative evidence, with respect to the allegations of May 20, 1991 and June 9, 1991, that the testimony was not trustworthy or credible. The applicant states that the CRDD improperly imposed a higher standard of proof upon him than was required in law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[27] It is submitted that there was no evidence before the CRDD which contradicted the applicant's evidence concerning his and his father's arrests. As such, it was not open for the board to draw a negative inference concerning the applicant's credibility. Furthermore, in this regard, the applicant argues that in making a negative inference concerning his credibility, based on a lack of corroborative evidence, the CRDD ignored documentary evidence confirming (1) the restricted freedom of the press; and (2) that the detention of many political detainees are done incommunicado.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[28] Finally, the applicant states that the CRDD erred in fact and law when it drew adverse inference concerning the credibility of the applicant's testimony that his house was surrounded by the Ghanian soldiers, on June 9, 1991. In the absence of uncontradicted evidence concerning this incident, and in light of documentary evidence of the persecution of perceived political opponents, the decision of the CRDD was unreasonable and based on irrelevant considerations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[29] The respondent maintains that the CRDD did not err in law in misstating the evidence. Here it is argued that the misstatement of the role or job of the Major is not a reviewable error of law because this point was not solely relied upon by the CRDD when it made its finding of credibility.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[30] In addition, the respondent states that the CRDD decision of an adverse finding of credibility was based on implausibilities and not a lack of corroborative evidence. It is submitted that the CRDD properly concluded that the applicant was not credible. The decision was reached having regard to the objective documentary evidence before the board. Moreover, the respondent contends that the CRDD, as the trier of fact, was entitled to weigh the documentary evidence as such against the testimony of the applicant and draw the conclusions which it did.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[31] Thus, the respondent submits that in considering the judgment of the CRDD as a whole, together with the evidence led at the hearing, it was reasonable and proper for the board to conclude accordingly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Issues:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[32] 1. Did the CRDD err in fact and law in finding the applicant's story not credible or trustworthy?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (a) Did the CRDD err in fact and law by misstating the evidence; failing to consider all the evidence before it?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (b) Did the CRDD err in law by applying a higher standard of evidence than that required by law?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Analysis:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Credibility And Trustworthiness Of Applicant's Testimony  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[33] As previously stated, the applicant contends that the CRDD based its decision that his testimony lacked credibility or trustworthiness by drawing inferences unsupported by the evidence and by ignoring portions of the applicant's testimony and documentary evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[34] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 199 (F.C.A.), Heald, J.A., enunciated the principle that where a board finds that the claimant's testimony is lacking in credibility, the board is under a duty to state in clear, unambiguous terms the reason for casting doubt upon the claimant's credibility.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[35] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 150 (F.C.A.), the board disbelieved the applicant and the court found that the reasons for disbelieving him were sparse. The board owed a duty to the applicant to give reasons for rejecting his claim on the ground of credibility in clear and unmistakable terms. The board's reasons did not contain a single word as to why the applicant's evidence was not credible. This formed an additional basis for setting aside the board's decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[36] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the F.C.A. held that a board acts arbitrarily in choosing to disbelieve an applicant's testimony where there exists no valid reason to doubt the truthfulness of it. In this case the Immigration Appeal Board found that the applicant's allegations of political persecution while in Chile to be untruthful even where the sworn testimony was uncontradicted. Heald, J.A., stated at p. 305:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"It is my opinion that the board acted arbitrarily in choosing without valid reasons to doubt the applicant's credibility concerning the sworn statements made by him and referred supra. When an applicant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness . On this record, I am unable to discover valid reasons for the board doubting the truth of the applicant's allegations above referred to. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[37] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the issue before the court was whether the Immigration Appeal Board erred in concluding that the applicant's testimony was not credible. Here the board found that the applicant's testimony of having squeezed through a hole the size of a soccer ball was not credible. In the absence of evidence to contradict the applicant's sworn testimony, the board determined that the applicant's body frame could not fit through such a space. Moreover, the board disbelieved the applicant's testimony that he had an injured knee. Here the board concluded that there was no medical reports to corroborate the testimony.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[38] In delivering the judgment of the court, Hugessen, J.A., reasoned as follows, at pp. 169-170:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"If the board was going to use such an insignificant matter as the basis for disbelieving the applicant, it would have, at the very least, to have evidence before it as to the precise dimensions of a soccer ball as well as evidence as to the measurements of the relevant parts of the applicant's body frame. Since there was none, it was error in law for the board to find as it did.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"... [T]he absence of medical evidence is not in itself grounds for doubting the applicant's story. Indeed, given such absence of medical evidence, it was not open to the board to find that a fracture to the applicant's knee would have made it impossible for him to have walked on it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"I have mentioned the board's zeal to find instances of contradiction in the applicant's testimony. While the board's task is a difficult one it should not be over-vigilant in its microscopic examination of the evidence of persons who, like the present applicant, testify through an interpreter and tell tales of horror in whose objective reality there is reason to believe. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[39] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court of Appeal concluded that a finding of lack of credibility must be based on internal contradictions, inconsistencies and not extrinsic criteria upon which the board draws inferences which are unsupported by the evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[40] Similarly, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  found the applicant not to be credible and this was a finding of credibility, the board's decision was set aside because the finding of credibility was based on irrelevant considerations and on considerations that were not established by the evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[41] Finally, reference may be made to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  raised was when is it proper for a board to draw negative inferences and disbelieve the testimony of a claimant. In this case the applicant's claim to Convention refugee status was rejected by the Immigration Appeal Board based on the board's finding that the applicant was not credible. The board rejected the claimant's testimony that the YMCA could organize a demonstration against a political execution in Ghana. The Federal Court of Appeal, per Madame Justice Desjardins held that the board erred in law by drawing negative inferences from the applicant's testimony. At p. 95 she states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"There is no basis to believe that a Christian association might find its responsibility to organize a demonstration in the case of the killing of individuals. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, and none appears on file, it was not open to the board to draw a negative inference as to what might have been the activities of an organization such as the YMCA in Ghana . <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[42] The foregoing legal principles are extremely relevant and highly applicable to the facts at bar. In the instant application the CRDD found the applicant's testimony not credible. The respondent is correct when he submits that it is open for the CRDD as the trier of fact, to evaluate the evidence and accord due weight to it. Notwithstanding, the board cannot find a lack of credibility where the inconsistencies, upon which the finding is based, are not supported by the evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[43] In dismissing the applicant's claim for refugee status the CRDD concluded that the applicant's testimony did not have a ring of truth. The board claimed inconsistencies in the applicant's story being that (1) Major Boateng would be able to order the release of the applicant, on May 30, 1991, but a mere ten days later would be unable to prevent his or his father's arrest; (2) the father was a well known figure and yet there was no record of his arrest. I can find no valid reason for the CRDD's conclusion. The applicant's testimony, when sworn to the truth of the allegations, is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt the truthfulness. I find no valid reason for the CRDD's conclusion notwithstanding the fact that the board had before it Human Rights Organization documents listing arrests of prominent persons and listing various coup attempts.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[44] The applicant gave evidence which provided a reasonable explanation for this inconsistency. The affidavit of Kristen Marshall (applicant's record, p. 114) provides a transcription of several sections of the Convention refugee hearing tapes. The evidence indicates that the applicant was questioned as to the reason why Major Boateng could not prevent the second arrests. At p. 115 of the Marshall affidavit it states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"b) on side 4 of tape no. 2  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Clark (Board Member): Do you have any idea why Major Boateng, your relative, who you describe in your PIF as having a power over life and death, why he would not have been able to use his good offices for your father as he did for you, for yourself?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Ahortor: We were all arrested on the 20th of May. None of us were aware, I was also arrested. On this 9th of June, supposing I was at home and not at church, I would also be arrested. My father was at home, that was why he was arrested ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"f) on side 4 of tape no. 2  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Ahortor: Major Boateng has used his position to get us released the first time. So this time, the Chief of State Security has issued that we should be arrested and shot. He can't do anything.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Menkir: Why do you believe so? Why can't he help you?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Ahortor: That is the Chief of State Security, and he works under him. If he is the head of the B.N.I. -- the Chief of State Security -- said that we should be arrested, so he can't do anything. That is why, like supposing he can do something, he should have helped me stay. But he suggested I should leave the country immediately.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Menkir: So how do you know it was the Chief of State Security who passed the directions for your arrest?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Ahortor: I sent my girlfriend to Major Boateng that early morning. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[45] In my opinion, any inconsistency with respect to the power of Major Boateng was reasonably explained by the applicant's evidence. Thus, in accordance with the jurisprudence, it was not open for the CRDD to draw adverse inferences and conclude that the applicant's story was not credible because the Major would have been able to assist him and his father. Evidence to support such a finding did not appear on the record. Rather, in finding inconsistencies, the CRDD appears, to me, to have failed to take relevant considerations into account and to have misconstrued the evidence presented.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[46] The board appears to have erred in finding the applicant not credible because he was not able to provide documentary evidence corroborating his claims. As in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where the Federal Court of Appeal held that the applicant was not required to provide medical reports to substantiate his claim of injury, similarly here the applicant is not expected to produce copies of an arresting report. This failure to offer documentation of the arrest, while a correct finding of fact, cannot be related to the applicant's credibility, in the absence of evidence to contradict the allegations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[47] In addition, I have examined the record and it appears to me to indicate that there was evidence (from the oral testimony of the applicant and documentary evidence) to explain why such arrest reports would not be available. The Marshall affidavit states (see: p. 115 applicant's record):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"c) on side 4 of tape no. 2  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Hamilton (RHO): The question I have is: you've told us that your father was well-known, that he was involved in the club and everything, why, I'm wondering, could he disappear and no one know where he went?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Ahortor: Ghana is like that. It's nothing new. People are detained in the night and not seen again. Who are you going to ask?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Hamilton: Was there anything in the papers?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Ahortor: Nothing. The press is not free to publish ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[48] Furthermore, the documentary evidence examined confirms the applicant's testimony. The Amnesty International Report: Ghana - Political Imprisonment & Death Penalty , Report of Dec. 18, 1991, states that many political prisoners \"have been detained incommunicado -- denied access to families, lawyers and appropriate medical care for long periods -- and the effect is nondisclosure in many cases, there being no obligation on the authorities to provide information about their detention (see: pp. 56 and 74 of the applicant's record).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[49] As per the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , there was no basis for the CRDD to disbelieve the applicant of his father's possible arrest. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it was not open for the CRDD to draw a negative inference as to what might have been the reaction of people to news of the applicant's father's arrest. In addition, it was not open for the CRDD to render such a conclusion without having regard to the evidence which was properly before it which explained why news of the arrest did not reach public attention. I have given consideration to the many reports found in the file concerning the work of human rights groups and that they report, if they obtain the information, the disappearance of important individuals. Surely one cannot say the reports report every disappearance or arrest.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[50] Finally, I believe the CRDD erred when it concluded that the manner of arrest and treatment described by the applicant was not credible. The CRDD based its decision on documentary evidence tending to show that political prisoners have been treated humanely by the Ghanian authorities. Problematic is the abundance of documentary evidence, that was before the CRDD, which contradicts these findings. I refer to the report Ghana From 1981 - 1991: A Decade of Repression & Forced Migration and the Amnesty International Report: Ghana Political Imprisonment & The Death Penalty . Both these reports speak about the significant human rights abuses in the country, and how the business personalities in Accra and other regions were subject to unthinkable humiliations through being paraded in principal streets party nude. As well, as how the PNDC government expresses genocidal antagonism for opposition and reactionary attitudes to the party's socialist leanings. (See: pp. 27, 31 and 32 of the applicant's record).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Conclusion:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[51] I am satisfied that the CRDD erred in law when it concluded that the applicant's testimony was not credible. In the absence of evidence to the contrary the CRDD erred by relying on extrinsic criteria. As well, the CRDD appears to have erred by drawing of negative inferences, without considering the totality of the evidence before it. Finally, it was not open for the board to require documentary evidence to support the applicant's uncontradicted testimony. The CRDD committed a reviewable error of fact when it used the lack of corroborating evidence as a basis to disbelieve the applicant's allegations. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the CRDD erred in law when it based its findings on irrelevant considerations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[52] For the above reasons the application is allowed and the matter is hereby returned to a differently constituted panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board to reconsider the evidence in accordance with these reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[53] The case raises no serious question of general importance within the meaning of s. 82 of the Immigration Act .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Application allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Editor: Gary W.

{"id_": "054656", "body_str": ["[1] Reed, J. : The defendant appeals a decision of the Associate Senior Prothonotary which refused to require the plaintiffs, on discovery, to give answers and produce documents in response to certain questions. Eight categories of questions are in issue. These comprise questions relating to: assignments from the inventors of the patents in suit; correspondence and documents exchanged between the co-inventors Hazlehurst and Willard; an article which appeared in the American Metal Market, July 21, 1970; the corresponding U.S. patents, including the U.S. file wrappers; the compositions of the invention; a document produced from the discovery of Ian Hazlehurst dated December 21, 1971; the differences between insulators used in ingot feeding and tundish operations; added improvements with respect to the three layer system and what type of sand should be used in the system.", "[2] The plaintiffs' statement of claim is based on four patents, all of which relate to what are called tundishes. I understand these to be containers for holding molten steel. The patents relate to liners and other aspects of these containers. The liners prevent the molten steel from burning through the container; they are replaceable with each new pouring as required.", "[3] It is common ground that an appeal from a decision of a prothonotary is not a trial de novo. In the case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Fed. T.D.), Mr. Justice Collier, speaking of appeals from prothonotary's orders, stated at page 384: \"It must be remembered, this is an appeal from the decision of the prothonotary. It is not a trial de novo. The prothonotary had a discretion to extend the time for appeal in the manner he did. It must be shown that the prothonotary exercised his discretion on a wrong principle, or on a complete misapprehension of the facts, or for some other compelling reason requiring interference by a judge sitting in appellate position.\"", "[4] Mr. Justice Teitelbaum in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , commented on the decision in the Roebuck case: \"Thus it is for the plaintiffs to show that the Prothonotary exercised his discretion on a wrong principle when he ordered plaintiffs to provide some of the particulars asked for. Furthermore, a judge is not entitled merely to substitute his own appreciation of the facts ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 91; 15 F.T.R. 299 (T.D.), and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  wrong principle, when ordering that certain questions need not be answered, when he gives little in the way of reasons for his order. At the same time, I fully understand that the prothonotaries of the Federal Court have many applications to decide and it would be virtually impossible for them to give detailed reasons for each order issued by them. I should note, in addition, that counsel informed me that much of the jurisprudence which has been placed before me was not put before Mr. Giles.", "[6] The test to be applied with respect to questions on discovery is set out in the well known decision The  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) at 63: \"... It seems to me that every document relates to the matters in question in the action, which not only would be evidence upon any issue, but also which, it is reasonable to suppose, contains information which may -not which must -either directly or indirectly enable the party requiring the affidavit either to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary . I have put in the words 'either directly or indirectly,' because, as it seems to me, a document can properly be said to contain information which may enable the party requiring the affidavit either to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary, if it is a document which may fairly lead him to a train of inquiry, which may have either of these two consequences: the question upon a summons for a further affidavit is whether the party issuing it can ...\" (Underlining added)", "[7] And in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 139: \"... The correct test of relevancy for purposes of discovery was, in our opinion, propounded by McEachren, C.J., in the case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 359, 35 C.P.C. 68, when he said: 'It seems to me that the clear right of the plaintiffs to have access to documents which may fairly lead them to a train of inquiry which may directly or indirectly advance their case or damage the defendant's case particularly on the crucial question of one party's version of the agreement being more probably correct than the other, entitles the plaintiffs to succeed on some parts of this application.' \"When produced the documents in the file may assist the appellant in its defence. On the other hand, they may not and may, as the respondent says, be totally irrelevant. In either event, the matter in issue may be more readily resolved at trial although their ultimate relevance and the weight to be attached to them will be matters for the trial judge.\" (Underlining added) I will consider, then, the eight categories of questions in the light of these principles. Assignments From The Inventors To Foseco Trading Or Foseco International", "[8] Paragraph 4 of the statement of claim alleges: \"4. Foseco Trading is the registered owner of: (a) Canadian Letters Patent 963,231 (the 'Expendable Liner Patent') issued February 25, 1975 for the invention of tundishes having expendable lining for use in continuous casting of metals made up of slabs of refractory, heat-insulating material; (b) Canadian Letters Patent 977,124 (the 'Unbonded [sic] Particulate Patent') issued November 4, 1975 for the invention of tundishes having a layer of unbonded [sic] particulate refractory material between their permanent and expendable linings; (c) Canadian Letters Patent 1,045,261 (the 'Magnesia-Olivine Patent') issued December 26, 1978 for the invention of a refractory, heat-insulating composition containing a mixture of particulate magnesia and olivine; and (d) Canadian Letters Patent 1,063,770 (the 'Expendable Beam Patent') issued October 9, 1979 for the invention of tundishes having at least one expendable beam of refractory, heat-insulating material extending between opposite sides of the tundish casing, adjacent to the impact area, and a method of continuously casting metal employing such tundishes.\" The statement of defence asserts: \"3. With respect to paragraph 4 of the statement of claim, the defendant admits that: (a) Canadian Letters Patent No. 963,231 issued on February 25, 1975 for an alleged invention entitled \"Continuous Casting'; (b) Canadian Letters Patent No. 977,124 is issued on November 4, 1975 for an alleged invention entitled 'Tundishes'; (c) Canadian Letters Patent No. 1,045,261 issued on December 26, 1978 for an alleged invention entitled 'Refractory Heat-Insulating Materials'; (d) Canadian Letters Patent No. 1,063,770 issued on October 9, 1979 for an alleged invention entitled 'Tundish With Weirs'; but otherwise denies the allegations in the said paragraph and further says that the said Letters Patents speak for themselves.\"", "[9] The plaintiffs have provided the defendant with copies of the assignments from Foseco International to the plaintiff Foseco Trading A.G. but have refused to produce copies of the assignments from the individual inventors to Foseco Trading A.G. or Foseco International as the case may be (Hazlehurst and Willard for patent 963,321; Seguin and Wiet for patent 977,124; Courtney and Wardell for patent 1,045,261; Eccleston for patent 1,063,770). Patents 963,231 and 977,124 were issued to Foseco International; patents 1,045,261 and 106,377 were issued to the plaintiff Foseco Trading A.G. Counsel for the defendant argues that the pleadings have put the ownership of the patents in issue and that in producing the assignments from Foseco International to Foseco Trading A.G., for patents 963,231 and 977,124 the plaintiffs have admitted the relevance of the documents which are being sought.", "[10] Counsel for the plaintiffs argues that while documents must be produced, if they would lead to a train of inquiry which might advance or defeat either side of the case, that train of inquiry must relate to an issue which has been pleaded. In addition, he notes that all assignments which came into existence, subsequent to the issues of the patents have been produced.", "[11] I am not convinced that the prothonotary exercised his discretion on a wrong principle in refusing to require that the questions be answered. I am not convinced that ownership as between the inventors and the companies to whom the patents were granted (the registered owners) was put in issue by the pleadings. A decision by the prothonotary to that effect is quite supportable by the pleadings. Correspondence And Documents Exchanged Between The Co-Inventors Hazlehurst And Willard", "[12] It is important to put this question (Q. 157) in context. It is my understanding from counsel's arguments that the correspondence and documents sought under this rubric relate to discussions and correspondence respecting the development of the invention, which it is alleged the co-inventors made and which is covered by what is referred to as the \"basic\" patent (963,231). The defendant alleges in the statement of defence that the invention made is not the invention claimed. In that context, discussions between the co-inventors relating to the development of the invention are clearly relevant. Counsel's main argument in support of the prothonotary's ruling is that the question asked is too general, that it is not specific enough to admit of easy answer: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In addition, in the context of the examination for discovery as a whole, it is argued that the question has essentially been answered.", "[13] Insofar as the question relates to correspondence and documents exchanged by the inventors relating to the development of the invention they should be produced. If all relevant documents have already been produced, then, that is the answer to be given. I do not think the question can be classified as too general so as to escape the requirement that it be answered. If that is indeed the reason upon which the prothonotary relied in refusing to require that the question be answered, then, I am of the view there was a misapprehension as to the nature and scope of the question. On reading the question in the context of the discovery transcript, however, despite counsel's argument, I have wondered whether the question did not relate to the development of the patent application rather than to the development of the invention. To the extent that that is the case the reasons which follow apply. American Metal Market Article (A.M.M. Article) And Questions Relating To The Corresponding U.S. Patents To The Canadian Patents In Issue, Including The U.S. File Wrappers", "[14] I will deal with these two categories of questions together; they both raise questions concerning the admissibility of information relating to or found in foreign patent applications. An article in the American Metal Market Journal , dated July 21, 1979, described a tundish having replaceable liners which had been developed by Foseco. This was filed as part of the U.S. patent application. Mr. Fish, the plaintiffs' representative on discovery, was asked why the A.M.M. Article was filed as part of the patent application in the United States but not filed as part of the Canadian application. He was also asked about its origins and whether it had been discussed with the inventors. Clearly the origins of the article and the knowledge of the inventors relating thereto are relevant.", "[15] As has been noted, the questions relating to the A.M.M. Article are mixed in nature. The questions listed under the rubric \"corresponding U.S. patents ... U.S. file wrappers\" are also mixed in nature. Some relate to the patent application, others relate to the knowledge of the plaintiffs concerning the nature of the invention and the knowledge of the inventors. For example question 799 contains two questions. The first asks: \"Inquire as to what extent there was consultation with the named inventor with respect to the changes to the claims and to the remarks that are set out in the remarks portion of the document entitled 'Amendment' bearing stamp received February 25, 1977.\" The second, asks: \"Inquire as to whether the plaintiffs are prepared to accept the statements that are made as being accurate and whether they are prepared to accept that the amended claim currently defines the invention that was made by the inventor, assuming he made the invention.\" I do not propose to consider each of the questions listed under the heading \"corresponding U.S. patents ...\" separately (each numbered question can contain a dozen or more subquestions). As is the case with the A.M.M. Article, the questions clearly should be answered insofar as they ask for factual information, for example, concerning the knowledge or activities of the inventors in relation to the invention, any publication thereof and any descriptions of their invention which the inventors made.", "[16] What then of questions which clearly relate only to the prosecution of the patent application. As I read the jurisprudence this does not admit of easy answer. In the United States, a doctrine known as file wrapper estoppel developed. It is based on the principle that an inventor will not be allowed to make representations to the patent office, including amendments to a patent application, in order to avoid being refused a patent and later, in the context of an infringement action assert a contrary position. That is, a patentee will not be allowed to assert that the patent covers elements or aspects of the subject (for example, if making an argument that the patent has been substantially but not literally infringed) which were disclaimed or abandoned in discussions with the patent office.", "[17] Evidence concerning information in patent applications (file wrappers) is also admissible in the United Kingdom even when the evidence in question relates to the prosecution of a corresponding foreign patent: see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, the court used file wrapper evidence in determining whether or not there had existed prior publication relating to the patent in question. Correspondence from the prosecution of the corresponding American patent was used to support the finding that the patentee was aware of such prior publication and consequently, in the patent application, limited what had originally been a broad claim. Not only was file wrapper evidence from the American patent considered admissible but reference was made as well to the Swiss patent.", "[18] The same judge who decided the Bentley Engineering case, Graham, J., declined in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 241, to admit the evidence of a lawyer, which was sought for the purpose of proving how a document entitled \"Record of Invention\" would be interpreted under United States law. It was held that this interpretation was irrelevant. I would note that the document itself was not rejected as inadmissible.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the plaintiff was not ordered to produce evidence from related United States patent applications because to do so was considered to constitute a fishing expedition. The judgment did not however, consider them to be intrinsically inadmissible.", "[19] It is clear from Canadian jurisprudence, that until 1956, it was the practice of the parties in a patent infringement action to file the record of the corresponding U.S. patent prosecution proceedings when such was considered relevant to the issues before the court (see editorial note at 24 C.P.R. 105). In 1956, however, President Thorson of the Exchequer Court held that the latter were not admissible because they concerned what had happened in another country, under another system of law. As such, it was held they could not affect the validity or invalidity of the claims in a Canadian patent: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . President Thorson again reiterated this view, a year later in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Supreme Court, in the context of an appeal of an interlocutory order: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  J., of the Exchequer Court. The decision concerned a paragraph of a statement of defence which alleged that the patent of invention, with respect to which infringement was being claimed, was the same invention as that for which a corresponding patent had issued in the United States. The paragraph of the statement of defence alleged that the plaintiffs were bound by the amendments, admissions and statements made in the course of the proceeding before the U.S. patent office. The paragraph of the statement of defence in question concluded with the words \"The Defendant at the trial of the action will refer to the proceedings before the Canadian and United States Patent Offices in respect to the application for the said patents and the prior patents cited therein\". Dumoulin, J., struck out this paragraph of the statement of defence.", "[21] The Supreme Court reversed the decision of Dumoulin, J., and the paragraph was restored to the statement of defence. The court made it clear in rendering its decision that the question of the admissibility of the evidence concerning the prosecution of the patent applications both in Canada and in the U.S. was a matter to be left for the decision of the trial judge. The trial judge who subsequently presided over the Beatty Bros. case was President Thorson. He held that the evidence tendered was not admissible: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Ironically, in rendering that decision, he referred to a 1935 decision written by Mr. Justice Learned Hand, as support for the position that such evidence was inadmissible. Mr. Justice Learned Hand is known as being largely responsible for the development of the \"file wrapper estoppel\" doctrine in the United States.", "[22] In 1968, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Supreme Court referred to correspondence and proceedings relating to patent applications in both Switzerland and the U.S. These applications corresponded to the Canadian patent in issue: \"The respondent in applying for the Swiss patent was thus asserting that within the meaning of the Swiss federal law, the process of fermentation and of extraction was a chemical process. This is perhaps not as decisive as the admission of practical utility resulting from the patent application made in the United States and which was considered by this court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Davis ... [1964] S.C.R. 351. ... It is nevertheless true that the application for the Swiss patent shows that when it was necessary to obtain a patent, the respondent was prepared to say that there was a chemical process involved. It is therefore not as indefensible as the respondent's experts have asserted.\"", "[23] In 1982, the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  upheld a decision ordering that answers be given to questions concerning statements made to the United States and Canadian Patent Offices. The answers were sought by the defendant to support its plea of estoppel.", "[24] In 1984, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Strayer, at pp. 86 and 87 ruled that portions of an examination for discovery which related to the prosecution of the applications for the Canadian patent and the corresponding U.S. patent were inadmissible. He held that the construction of a patent was a matter of law to be based on the patent document itself and that a patentee cannot enlarge the scope of his patent by introducing extraneous evidence, nor should a defendant in an infringement action be able to narrow the scope by introducing such evidence.", "[25] In the same year, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), it was held that the files respecting the United States patent applications were admissible for the purpose of establishing the date of invention, convention date and joint inventorship. It was stated, however, that this evidence could not be used to construe a claim or limit its scope.", "[26] In 1987, the Associate Senior Prothonotary ordered production of documents concerning foreign patent applications and ordered that questions relating thereto be answered: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . On an appeal from that decision, (1987), 15 C.P.R.(3d) 447, Mr. Justice Strayer doubted that correctness of this ruling but agreed to confirm it because the parties had agreed thereto.", "[27] In 1988, Mr. Justice Pinard in Eli Lilly & Co. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 342, at 367 C.P.R., stated: \"... Without having to decide if some of those documents [U.S. patent application files and documents and correspondence relating thereto] were properly filed in evidence, I maintain the plaintiff's objections to their admissibility. Indeed, I consider that there is no basis in Canadian law whereby a Canadian or foreign patent application file relating to the patent in issue can be admitted into evidence, for the purpose of limiting the construction put on the clauses, or establishing misrepresentation or otherwise.\"", "[28] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 291, at 314, I admitted information contained in file wrappers, not for the purpose of construing the terms of the patent but as evidence of what prior art had been before the patent examiner. This I considered to be relevant to the presumption of validity which is accorded an issued patent.", "[29] In the light of all this jurisprudence, what is the applicable principle? It seems clear that information contained in file wrappers, either domestic or foreign, may be relevant for some purposes on some occasions. It may be that much of the information obtained by asking questions relating thereto will turn out to be irrelevant but that is a decision for the trial judge to decide in the context of the case as presented. It is often difficult to know whether the answer to a question is relevant before one knows what the answer is and how it fits into the defendant's theory of its case. Accordingly, I am of the view that the prothonotary proceeded on a wrong principle in refusing to require that the questions be answered. The train of enquiry is one that the defendant is entitled to pursue at this stage. In the light of the jurisprudence set out above, it is my view, that it is premature at the discovery stage to prevent questions being asked concerning information contained in file wrappers. Questions Relating To The Composition Of The Invention", "[30] The defendant argues that these questions relate to factual aspects of the invention made. The plaintiffs claim that they relate to the interpretation of the patent and matters of expert opinion which the witness in question was not qualified to give: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) 538; also 14 C.P.R.(3d) 357 at p. 365 and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), 219.", "[31] The questions relate to page 2, line 18 of Canadian Patent 1,045,261 and page 2, lines 21 to 25 and page 3, lines 1 to 24. The type of questions in issue, are illustrated by the following three: \"Determine whether the reference to the weight ratio of magnesia and olivine being 1 to 10 and 4 to 1 and the composition containing at least 1% by way of fibrous material constitutes the narrow range that was spoken of previously. \"Inquire as to whether is there one end of the range where no bentonite clay, no cellulosic fibre and no refractory fibrous material is used except to the extent that there must be at least 1% by weight of fibrous material. \"Inquire as to whether there is any information in the patent that would tell the reader of that patent as to whether there is any requirement for a particular type of kind of olivine that must be used.\"", "[32] Counsel for the defendant argues that the questions should be interpreted as seeking factual information concerning the plaintiff companies' knowledge. I am not convinced that this is a compelling characterization. I would not characterize the questions as asking factual information about the plaintiff companies' knowledge as opposed to seeking an interpretation of the patent. I could not conclude that the prothonotary proceeded on a wrong principle in refusing to order that the questions be answered. Question Relating To The Derek Helliwell Document", "[33] The question relates to a document produced on the examination of discovery of one of the inventors, Ian Hazlehurst. That document refers to \"our work\". The witness, Mr. Fish, who was being examined on discovery on behalf of the plaintiff companies was asked to find out what is meant by the reference to \"our work\". The plaintiffs argue that this is an improper question because it asks the witness to interpret the meaning of words in a document of which he was not the author and where the author was never in the employ of either party to the action and is no longer in the employ of the U.S. subsidiary Foseco Inc.", "[34] I find it useful to set out the defendant's arguments in answer to that position: \"The statement made by Mr. Helliwell relates to work done with Profax liners and tundishes, and it is believed that the statement he made specifically refers to work at Calumet Steel, which has been addressed in earlier argument and is referred to in the A.M.M. reference. Mr. Helliwell was at Calumet Steel with Mr. Jim Elder during tundish trials by Calumet and Foseco Inc. in the United States. Elsewhere in the document it is stated that the use of Profax was a 'dead give-away' to both Foseco's customers and competition. Mr. Kokonis, in asking the question of Mr. Fish with respect to this document, sought the company's knowledge of what work Helliwell was referring to in the document and the line of inquiry would have taken the witness through additional questions relating to Calumet Steel tundish trials and Mr. Helliwell's and other persons' involvement therewith. This entire line of questioning was objected to. It is submitted the questions are clearly relevant to the defendant's primary reference (the A.M.M. article) in attacking the validity of Canadian patent 963,231 in this action. \"It is also submitted that the fact that the document was produced by the plaintiffs is an admission of its relevance. The question should be allowed to be asked in respect of the document. Further, Mr. Fish's knowledge of prior art and the use of Profax liner boards in tundishes by Foseco Inc. prior to the date of invention are clearly relevant to the issues of invalidity as pleaded in respect of Canadian Patent 963,231. \"Finally, no reasonable excuse has been provided by the plaintiffs for Mr. Fish not to make reasonable inquiries of Mr. Helliwell to be able to answer the question asked. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 69. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 139. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  why the prothonotary refused to require the question to be answered because reasons were not given. If as counsel asserts it was because the question asks for the interpretation of a document then I am of the view that the prothonotary acted under a misapprehension as to the character of the question. The question, while it asks for an explanation of a reference which occurs in a written document, is asking a question of fact. It is not asking for an \"interpretation\" of the document. In my view, a distinction must be drawn between questions which refer to documents and ask for information concerning facts, which are stated therein and questions which ask a witness to interpret the document in the sense of answering what message or new information or meaning the witness takes from that document.", "[36] If the question was not ordered answered because Mr. Fish was not its author and the author is no longer in the employ of Foseco Inc., I do not think this absolves Mr. Fish from making reasonable enquiries. For the reasons given the question should be answered. Question Relating To The Differences Between Insulators Used In Ingot Feeding And Tundish Operations", "[37] The dispute concerning this question (Q. 426) is in part similar to that set out above concerning the reference to the Helliwell document. Counsel for the plaintiffs asserts that an answer is not required because the question asks for the interpretation of a document. In addition, it is argued that the response requires an expert opinion. Mr. Kokonis read a passage from an article entitled \"Continuous Casting of Steel\" with which the witness had said he was familiar and then asked a question of fact, which arguably requires an expression of opinion, by reference thereto: \"Although the detail demands of ingot feeding and cold tundish operations are different there are many similarities in the properties required of the working insulators in the two systems. \"And again, a technical question, I suppose, is I'd like to know what the differences are and what the many similarities are.\"", "[38] Counsel for the defendant argues: \"... The question was a question of fact relating to corporate knowledge of what the differences and similarities are between ingot feeding and cold tundish operations. As has been discussed previously before this court, the plaintiffs made use of Profax boards which were used in ingot feeding operations to line tundishes in continuous casting operations. It has been asserted in the statement of defence and counterclaim that the technology used in lining tundishes with expendable boards was obvious and known in the art, prior to the alleged date of invention and more than two years before the filing date of the patent application in Canada (subparagraphs 18(a) to 18(d) of the statement of defence). \"As well, this question goes to the issue of advance over the state of the art and what the alleged invention is perceived to be by the inventors, and it is thus relevant for these reasons as well. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 204 (F.C.A.).\"", "[39] As noted above, a distinction must be made between a question which uses references in a document as a framework for asking a question concerning the factual knowledge of a party and one which asks for an interpretation of the document. In the former, the description found in the document is being used as a reference for the factual question, but the witness is not being asked to interpret the document as such.", "[40] The objection to the question on the ground that it seeks an opinion from the witness is more difficult to answer. The difficulty arises from the fact that a question can often be properly characterized as both one of opinion and one of fact; it is difficult, if not impossible, to draw a precise line between \"fact\" and \"opinion\" [see footnote 1]. As in the case of the hearsay rule, a rephrasing of a question can often convert it from being a question of one certain character to that of another, without a significant difference existing in the content of the answer.", "[41] In the text by Williston and Rolls, The Law of Civil Procedure , v. 2 (Butterworths, 1970) at 816, a rule respecting opinion evidence on discovery is described as follows: \"Questions are not admissible which involve the expert opinion of the witness or the opinion of his experts, and will not generally be allowed for the purpose of securing an admission of fact, the truth of which is a matter of opinion . Consequently, a party should not be interrogated on a question which he can only answer by consulting an expert and repeating the expert's opinion.\" (Footnote omitted) (Underlining added) There has however been a general trend towards a broadening of the scope of discovery. The Federal Court Rules themselves have recently been amended in this regard, although the present examination for discovery took place under the earlier rules. While the Williston and Rolls text indicates that questions will not be required to be answered to secure an admission of fact, the truth of which is a matter of opinion, it seems to me a contrary approach was taken, for example, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (High Ct.). In that case it was held that questions of mixed fact and opinion within common experience were to be answered and that questions of mixed fact and opinion which deal overwhelmingly with factual matters should be answered", "[42] I have been unable to find any expression in the Federal Court jurisprudence of the principle to be applied in this court to questions of mixed fact and opinion. It has been held that an individual being examined for discovery will not be required to give opinion evidence unless the expertise of the witness is put in issue by the pleadings: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.); Choate, Discovery in Canada , Carswell 1977, at 98-99. In the Irish Shipping case, the question which was held to seek an opinion from the captain and therefore not require an answer was \"how would you navigate the passage\". In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, the questions which were not required to be answered were of the following type: \"is it your opinion that the key stone butterfly valve ... [was] satisfactory for the job\"; \"in your opinion is there anything unsuitable about that type of valve\"; \"in your experience have you had occasions when you have turned a valve in a way that is similar to the valve with which we are dealing ...\".", "[43] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), it was held that a witness on discovery need not answer a question to ascertain the basis for a scientific opinion [see footnote 2] but that he had to answer questions in relation to the steps the plaintiff had taken to ascertain the state of the art in optical waveguards prior to commencing manufacture.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  allocation of costs among the transoceanic, international and domestic sectors at airports in the years in question was a subject matter for expert opinion to be disclosed in advance of trial pursuant to rule 482 and not by way of examination for discovery.", "[44] The Federal Court of Appeal has made it plain that when the evidence sought is the subject matter of expert opinion, evidence to be disclosed pursuant to rule 482, questions relating thereto, are not required to be answered on discovery. It has also made it plain that where the question is one clearly on its face seeking an opinion from the witness, that the question is not required to be answered. I have not been able to find, however, an articulation of the appropriate principle, in a case such as the present, where the information sought is technical in nature (and for that reason might be addressed in an affidavit of an expert witness), but is within the common knowledge of the plaintiff and where the question is of a factual nature although it can arguable be said to require an expression of opinion by the witness, in the sense that many assertions of \"fact\" require the expression of an \"opinion\". It is my conclusion that in such cases the principle to be applied is that the factual nature of the question takes precedence and the question should be answered. Accordingly, I find that the prothonotary proceeded on a wrong principle and the question should be answered. Question Relating To Page 2, Line 12 Of C.P. (Canadian Patent) 977,124 And Added Improvements Referred To With Respect To The Three-Layer System And What Type Of Sand Should Be Used In The System", "[45] The question in issue (Q. 718) asks: \"It has now been found that additional improvements may be obtained with the tundishes lined with a three-layer system. \"Do you have any information as to what those additional improvements are?\"", "[46] For reasons similar to those set out with respect to the immediately preceding question, this question should be answered. Order accordingly. Editor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/blk Footnotes 1. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 572 (B.C.).

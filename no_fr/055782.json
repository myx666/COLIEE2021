{"id_": "055782", "body_str": ["[1] Muldoon, J. : This is an appeal against an order of the Associate Senior Prothonotary delivered at Toronto, on March 20, 1996, dismissing the appellant's motion to compel the respondents to produce relevant documents. (Although the appellant/defendant appears manifestly to be plural, the peculiar \"culture\" of this case seems to be a designation in the singular. So be it.)", "[2] The plaintiffs, having been successful at trial and on appeal, were offered an election, and elected to take Imperial Oil's profits made from the infringement of the Lubrizol plaintiffs' Canadian Patent 1,094,044. That patent protects those plaintiffs' property in an additive to motor oil which the defendant appropriated, mixed with its Esso brands of oil and sold with, and mixed into, its Esso motor oils. Before the Associate Senior Prothonotary (hereinafter: A.S.P.), the defendant, Imperial Oil, contended that the profits (say, on a can of motor oil) ought to be apportioned, ostensibly \"... on the principle that all the plaintiff[s] should get would be the difference between the profit the defendant would have made had a non-infringing product been used and the profit it actually made using the infringing product,\" recited in reasons expressed by the learned A.S.P. What a fool's errand that would have been.", "[3] It is very much to be regretted that Parliament allows the remedy of accounting for profits to remain. It is a colossal waste of everybody's time, and the limited resources of the court in private litigation. This judge is not one who adores what judges in earlier centuries pronounced, as if they were superhuman clairvoyants invested with supernatural wisdom in all modern matters such as human rights in a modern federal State for example. Occasionally however, they faced the problems which exactly are faced in late Twentieth Century Canada. Although by no means clairvoyant, some of those judges of yesteryear were not fools either. On the question of apportioning profits earned by purloining a patented invention Lord Lindley, in England, 104 years ago, in the case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  finally that the plaintiff in an action for infringement of a patent, having succeeded, is entitled at his election either to damages or an account of profits, and that is the state of the law. The plaintiff therefore was perfectly within his right in electing, as he did in this case, to have an account of profits; but I do not know any form of account which is more difficult to work out, or may be more difficult to work out than an account of profits. One sees it - and I personally have seen a good deal of it - in partnership cases where the capital of a deceased or outgoing partner has been left in the trade; an account has been directed of the profits made in respect of his capital, which is something like the profits made in respect of an invention, and the difficulty of finding out how much profit is attributable to any one source is extremely great - so great that accounts in that form very seldom result in anything satisfactory to anybody. The litigation is enormous, the expense is great, and the time consumed is out of all proportion to the advantage ultimately attained; so much as that in partnership cases I confess I never knew an account in that form worked out with satisfaction to anybody. I believe in almost every case people get tired of it and get disgusted. Therefore, although the law is that a Patentee has a right to elect which course he will take, as a matter of business he would generally be inclined to take an inquiry as to damages, rather than launch upon an inquiry as to profits. \"However, here we have to deal with an inquiry as to profits, and this case shows, I think, that the observations which I have made are as applicable to this as they are to most other cases. The profits have been enquired into. There was an order made by Mr. Justice Kekewich on the 22nd of June 1889, giving directions to his Chief Clerk, who was carrying out the inquiry as to profits, and giving him directions to ascertain certain things with a view to better ascertaining the profits. In May 1888, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was given. We are now in January 1892. In June 1891, the Chief Clerk made a certificate: there was a summons to vary that, and the learned judge below discharged the certificate, and, unfortunately, as I think, instead of sending the matter back to a gentleman who knew all about it, he directed that the whole matter should go to an Official Referee who knew nothing whatever about it. That this would have been a right and proper action to refer to the Official Referee in the first instance I do not doubt, and I quite understand the reasons which induced Mr. Justice Kekewich to refer the matter to the Official Referee even at that stage, his reason being this, that an inquiry of this kind goes far to paralyse his staff of officers, who cannot get on with their other work. But still, looking at the parties, it seems to me to be most unfortunate that after this matter had been gone into before a most competent gentleman for years, and when any error in the certificate might have been put right by giving him specific directions which he could follow, the matter should be thrown open again and remitted to a person who knew nothing at all about it and who would have to go into it de novo. I think that order, which is appealed from, is very much to be regretted. \"Now, I will no more except this, that in consequence of the obvious difficulties felt by Counsel on both sides, they have, with the concurrence of their clients, consented to leave all matters in difference in this action to us to determine.", "[4] That three-judge division of the Court of Appeal never evinced more good sense than it then did in pragmatically, and perhaps arbitrarily fixing and granting a lump-sum award, which amounted to £3,000 (in 1892 pounds!) and all costs of the litigation. So it was not without good reason that the A.S.P. cited <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1 (T.D.). No thought of apportionment inheres in the judgment which Cullen, J., signed herein, on September 17, 1990. In its pertinent passages, it runs thus: \"4. the plaintiffs shall be entitled to be paid the damages suffered by them, or the profits made by the defendant as the plaintiffs may elect, the amount of such damages or profits to be determined on a reference pursuant to the order of Mr. Giles made March 22, 1989. In respect of such reference the following procedure shall apply: (a) ... any matter in issue as to the extent of infringement of Canadian Letters Patent 1,094,044, the damages flowing from such infringement and the profits of the defendant arising from such infringement , ...; (b) ... outlined in rule 465 in respect of all matters in issue as to the extent of infringement of Canadian Letters Patent 1,094,044, the damages flowing from such infringement and the profits of the defendant arising from such infringement (c) ... (d) ... relating to any matter in issue as to the extent of infringement of Canadian Letters Patent 1,094,044, and either the damages flowing from such infringement or the profits of the defendant arising from such infringement ... (d) [sic] ... in rule 465 in respect of all matters in issue as to the extent of infringement of Canadian Letters Patent 1,094,044, and either the damages flowing from such infringement or the profits of the defendant arising from such infringement ... (f) ... (g) following discovery there shall be a reference to determine the extent of infringement of Canadian Letters Patent 1,094,044 and either the damages flowing from such infringement or the profits of the defendant arising from such infringement ... (h) ... \"5. the defendant forthwith deliver up to the plaintiffs all ECA 7426, ECA 7473, ECA 7474, ECA 7500, ECA 10708, ECA 11014, ECA 10444, ECA 11100, ECA 10280, ECA 10274, ECA 10271, ECA 12812, ECA 12815, ECA 12819 or any other minor variants of any of them and any concentrates and lubricating compositions containing such materials;\"", "[6] The trial judgment was generally unanimously upheld on appeal. The Appeal Division's judgment of April 14, 1993 [reasons reported at (1993), 154 N.R. 196], made no mention of apportionment of profits, and it runs, thus: \"1. The judgment at trial dated September 17, 1990 is varied by adding new paragraph 3A as follows: '3A. ...' \"2. The said judgment at trial is further varied by deleting paragraph 9 and replacing it with new paragraph 9 as follows: '9. The plaintiffs shall be entitled to prejudgment and postjudgment interest at a rate determined in accordance with section 137 of the Courts of Justice Act , S.O. 1984, c. 11, as amended, calculated as follows: \"(1) with respect to damages assessed or profits made by the defendant as a result of its manufacture, use and sale of lubricating compositions and concentrates containing ECA 10444, ECA 10271 or ECA 12819, interest is to be calculated from the date of service of the statement of claim. \"(2) with respect to damages assessed or profits made by the defendant as a result of its manufacture, use and sale of all other infringing compositions, interest is to be calculated from the date the damages were suffered or the profits earned .\" \"3. The appeal is otherwise dismissed.'\"", "[7] Given that Imperial Oil's infringement product - Lubrizol's invention - was added to and formed only a minor portion by weight or volume of each can of the motor oil product sold by Imperial, it was tempting to think that the profit on such can of oil should be paid over to Lubrizol in the same proportion as the pirated additive was by weight or volume to the wrongfully made and sold contents of the can. That line of thought is too simplistic given other pertinent factors. It was the pirated Lubrizol additive which, after all, and after a certain epoch, made the can of oil saleable in the first place.", "[8] Mr. Justice Cullen, in his written reasons, had this to say: \"To comprehend the significance of the patent-in-suit, it must be placed in the context of the most developments in the motor oil additive industry. At present, the market for motor oil additives is in a state of great flux. Lubricants marketed in North America are subject to standards promulgated by the American Petroleum Institute ('API'). On March 4, 1988, the API promulgated new standards for motor oil. These new 'SG' standards were much more demanding, and were designed for the needs of contemporary passenger vehicles. The improvement in the standards was the most significant upgrading in the history of the passenger motor car oil additive industry. To meet these new high standards, base oils are not changed, but rather motor oil additives are used. The challenge was to develop an additive whose treat rate met the new standards at the lowest possible cost. \"In essence, reformulation was required of virtually every motor oil, and this created a good deal of concern and some turmoil in the marketplace. It also created an opportunity for the additive supplier who could meet the new standards at a low cost to gain and keep a significant market share. Purchasers of lubricating oil additives are generally reluctant to change suppliers but when new standards are issued there is potential for loyalties to shift dramatically.\" (33 C.P.R.(3d) p. 6, 39 F.T.R. pp. 165-66 paragraphs [8] and [9])", "[9] In the reasons of Mr. Justice Mahoney expressed for the Appeal Division (1992), 150 N.R. 207; 45 C.P.R.(3d) 449, this was written [at p. 209 N.R.]: \"The invention is concerned with chemical processes and compositions; we are concerned only with some of the compositions. The monopoly claimed is not limited to a particular composition or a number of particular compositions but to a class of compositions. It is described as 'an improvement in the known field of lubricant additive technology which has developed since the 1950's around high molecular weight carboxylic acid acylating agents and various acylated derivatives thereof'. The particular additives are generally called dispersants or detergents. This technology is what has made possible increasingly extended periods between oil changes.\" (p. 453, lines c to e C.P.R.)", "[10] So, it appears that the profits here are no matter of mere apportionment by weight or volume. It appears that Imperial decided to steal Lubrizol's invention in order to be able to sell Imperial's motor oil at some profit; otherwise those millions of cans of oil might well have been worth less or even utterly worthless without the stolen ingredient. Such are the inferences which the court draws. It is true common knowledge that whereas the average motorist has the car's engine oil changed by the car's regular mechanic every several months, and buys a can of motor oil if such be necessary, upon buying fuel for the engine, Imperial would have sold little or no motor oil without the Lubrizol additive, if Imperial practiced truth in its advertizing. Imperial's counsel argues - probably quite accurately - that \"there is a whole range of factors which contribute to the ultimate profit on a finished oil\", but there is no profit at all on motor oil which no one wishes to buy. Imperial itself - long before it engaged its present counsel, demonstrated the validity of the last expressed observation. Imperial decided to infringe Lubrizol's patent for the additive Imperial itself deemed it needed to keep its motor oil marketable.", "[11] The trial judge ordered that the plaintiffs could take \"the profits of the defendant arising from such infringement\". It appears wholly equitable for the defendant to yield up its profits on the motor oil - its total profits. Paragraph 2 of the trial judgment makes this notion of yielding all profits on the activities therein described, crystal clear.", "[12] If the plaintiffs can show other patent infringement in regard to yet other additives or lubricating compositions in the same cans of motor oil, at a later date in other court actions, they must remember that, having taken all of Imperial's profits in this action, there will be no more profits to be taken on the same cans of motor oil in other lawsuits. The learned Associate Senior Prothonotary's order from which this appeal is taken, dismissed Imperial's motion: \"... requiring the plaintiffs to file and serve a more complete list of documents ... relating to [apportionment of profits]\"", "[13] Lubrizol's documents can hardly be relevant to Imperial's profits. Nor to an apportionment of Imperial's profits since Imperial is not entitled to any such apportionment.", "[14] Counsel, especially the plaintiff's counsel have been most anxious to have this decision at an earlier date. They should remember such anxiety next time they are tempted to - if not merely unthinkingly - inflict two months' reading on a busy judge.", "[15] The defendant's appeal is dismissed, and the learned A.S.P.'s order dated March 20, 1996, is affirmed. Costs are awarded in the plaintiffs' favour. Appeal dismissed. Editor: Giovanni A. Merlini/slm [End of document]"]}

{"id_": "002744", "body_str": ["[1] Joyal, J. : The following is further to the order and brief oral reasons therefore which I issued at the close of the hearing on this application for judicial review.", "[2] There is no doubt that counsel for the applicant has articulately set out the parameters to which the Refugee Board must adhere when dealing with a refugee claim. I am in full agreement with him that a departure from these parameters, as well as certain doctrines propounded from time to time by the Federal Court of Appeal, do provide adequate safeguards to an unsuccessful refugee claimant who comes before this court for review. Otherwise, the impugned decision will be quashed. There has been, as we all know, a plethora of Appeal decisions quashing credibility panel or Refugee Board decisions.", "[3] For purposes of judicial review, however, it is my view that a Refugee Board's decision must be interpreted as a whole. One might approach it with a pathologist's scalpel, subject it to a microscopic examination or perform a kind of semantic autopsy on particular statements found in the decision. But mostly, in my view, the decision must be analyzed in the context of the evidence itself. I believe it is an effective way to decide if the conclusions reached were reasonable or patently unreasonable.", "[4] I have now read through the transcript of the evidence before the Board and I have listened to arguments from both counsel. Although one may isolate one comment from the Board's decision and find some error therein, the error must nevertheless be material to the decision reached. And this is where I fail to find any kind of error.", "[5] It is true that artful pleaders can find any number of errors when dealing with decisions of administrative tribunals. Yet we must always remind ourselves of what the Supreme Court of Canada said on a criminal appeal where the grounds of appeal were some 12 errors in the judge's charge to the jury. In rendering judgment, the court stated that it had found 18 errors in the judge's charge, but that in the absence of any miscarriage of justice, the appeal could not succeed.", "[6] This is the point I am trying to establish here. One may look at the decision of the Board, then one may balance it off against the evidence found in the transcript and the evidence of the claimant himself in trying to justify his objective as well as subjective fears of persecution.", "[7] On the basis of that analysis, I find that the conclusions reached by the Refugee Board are well-founded on the evidence. There can always be conflict on the evidence. There is always the possibility of an opposite decision from a differently constituted Board. Anyone might have reached a different conclusion. Different conclusions may often be reached if one perhaps subscribes to different value systems. But in spite of counsel for the applicant's thorough exposition, I have failed to grasp forcefully the kind of error in the Board's decision which would justify my intervention. The Board's decision, in my view, is fully consistent with the evidence.", "[8] The Trial Division of this court is just now entering into this field of judicial review, and I believe that it will try to subscribe to and respect the guidelines which have been expressed by the Court of Appeal. This is easily said but not always easily applied when dealing with particular cases. I should hope that counsel will share that concern as the Trial Division assumes this new jurisdiction.

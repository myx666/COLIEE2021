{"id_": "005628", "body_str": ["[1] Mandamin, J. : Mr. Ding Yang (identified in the style of cause as Ding Yan) appeals the refusal of his citizenship application pursuant to subsection 14(5) of the Citizenship Act (\" Act \"), s. 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act , and rule 300 of the Federal Court Rules", "[2] Mr. Yang contends the Citizenship Judge lost jurisdiction due to delay and/or because the Judge did not consider all the evidence demonstrating residency. Mr. Yang seeks as a remedy a declaration by this Court essentially confirming his entitlement to citizenship. FACTS", "[3] Mr. Yang is 29 years old and from Hunan in the People's Republic of China. He first came to Canada on January 24, 1997 and he became a permanent resident on June 24, 2002. He applied to become a Canadian citizen on October 18, 2004.", "[4] The time period relevant to Mr. Yang's citizenship application is October 18, 2000 to October 18, 2004. As calculated under the Act , Mr. Yang was physically present in Canada 1059 days, 36 days short of the minimum 1095 days required in a four pear period. Mr. Yang was absent for family visits to China and sightseeing.", "[5] Mr. Yang sought to prove he established residence in Canada notwithstanding his absences. He had been married to a Canadian woman but later divorced. He entered into business relationships; he owned a condominium which he subsequently sold; and he was registered to study at York University. He even submitted documentation about being charged and convicted of summary offences, initially to show the convictions did not adversely affect his application but later submitting it also demonstrating residency.", "[6] The Citizenship Judge interviewed Mr. Yang on January 15, 2007. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Judge reserved his decision and requested more documentation. Mr. Yang submitted further information to the Citizenship Judge on January 15 and February 9, 2007. DECISION UNDER APPEAL", "[7] On April 24, 2008, the Citizenship Judge issued the decision on Mr. Yang's application for citizenship.", "[8] The Citizenship Judge noted that Mr. Yang was short 36 days of the minimum 1095 days residency required during the four years preceding application. The Judge referred to Mr. Yang's acknowledgement that his application was dependent on the submission of additional documentation and stated Mr. Yang failed to provide the additional documents requested. Finally, some of the documents did not relate to the relevant time period.", "[9] The Citizenship Judge stated in part: \"... You stated in your application that you were physically present in Canada for 1154 days during the relevant period and absent 95 days. You are 36 days short of the minimum requirement of 1,095 days as prescribed in Paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act \"At the hearing, you were requested to provide additional documents to support your claim of residence in Canada. The letter of January 15, 2007, which you were given at the interview further stated that 'I understand that, should such documentation not be provided, my Citizenship Application will be [sic] non approved by the Judge.' \"To date, you have failed to provide the additional documents requested and some documents are not within the four year review period (October 18, 2000 to October 18, 2004). ... \"I was therefore unable to determine whether or not you met all the requirements of the Act with respect to [sic] 'Residence'. \"The Issue: \"Have you, the applicant, accumulated at least three years (1,095 days) of residence in Canada within the four years (1,460 days) immediately preceding the date of your application for Canadian citizenship? \"Decision: \"For reasons provided above, I am unable to approve your application because you have not met the residence requirement under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act ...\"", "[10] The Judge refused Mr. Yang's application for citizenship. ISSUES", "[11] The issues in this appeal are: 1. What is the effect of the Citizenship Judge's failure to render a decision within the 60 days required by the Act 2. Did the Citizenship Judge err in refusing the citizenship application? 3. What remedy is available if the citizenship judge erred in respect of either of the above issues? LEGISLATION", "[12] The Act provides: \"5(1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who (a) makes application for citizenship; (b) is eighteen years of age or over; (c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner: (i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and (ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence; \"14(1) An application for (a) a grant of citizenship under subsection 5(1) or (5), (b) [Repealed, 2008, c. 14, s. 10] (c) a renunciation of citizenship under subsection 9(1), or (d) a resumption of citizenship under subsection 11(1) shall be considered by a citizenship judge who shall, within sixty days of the day the application was referred to the judge, determine whether or not the person who made the application meets the requirements of this Act and the regulations with respect to the application. \"Interruption of proceedings \"(1.1) Where an applicant is a permanent resident who is the subject of an admissibility hearing under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the citizenship judge may not make a determination under subsection (1) until there has been a final determination whether, for the purposes of that Act, a removal order shall be made against that applicant. \"(1.2) [Repealed, 2001, c. 27, s. 230] \"Advice to Minister \"(2) Forthwith after making a determination under subsection (1) in respect of an application referred to therein but subject to s. 15, the citizenship judge shall approve or not approve the application in accordance with his determination, notify the Minister accordingly and provide the Minister with the reasons therefor. \"Notice to applicant \"(3) Where a citizenship judge does not approve an application under subsection (2), the judge shall forthwith notify the applicant of his decision, of the reasons therefor and of the right to appeal. \"Sufficiency \"(4) A notice referred to in subsection (3) is sufficient if it is sent by registered mail to the applicant at his latest known address. \"Appeal \"(5) The Minister or the applicant may appeal to the Court from the decision of the citizenship judge under subsection (2) by filing a notice of appeal in the Registry of the Court within sixty days after the day on which (a) the citizenship judge approved the application under subsection (2); or (b) notice was mailed or otherwise given under subsection (3) with respect to the application. \"Decision final \"(6) A decision of the Court pursuant to an appeal made under subsection (5) is, subject to s. 20, final and, notwithstanding any other Act of Parliament, no appeal lies therefrom. \"15(1) Where a citizenship judge is unable to approve an application under subsection 14(2), the judge shall, before deciding not to approve it, consider whether or not to recommend an exercise of discretion under subsection 5(3) or (4) or subsection 9(2) as the circumstances may require.\" b) [Abrog√©, 2008, ch. 14, art. 10] \"Appel STANDARD OF REVIEW", "[13] In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "[14] In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED further distinguished between the interpretation of statutes or jurisprudence and fact finding by citizenship judges: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "[15] In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Supreme Court held it was not necessary to conduct a standard of review analysis where a standard was previously decided. Accordingly I conclude the standard of review in this matter is correctness in the interpretation of statute or jurisprudence and reasonableness in the application of facts to the law. ANALYSIS Sixty Day Requirement for Decision", "[16] Mr. Yang contends he was prejudiced by delay since he left Canada shortly after the hearing to work for family in China, and by implication he lost the opportunity to remedy the 36 day shortfall by staying in Canada. The Respondent responds by simply noting that Mr. Yang left even before the 60 days period expired.", "[17] The Act provides: \"14(1) An application for (a) a grant of citizenship under subsection 5(1), shall be considered by a citizenship judge who shall, within sixty days of the day the application was referred to the judge, determine whether or not the person who made the application meets the requirements of this Act and the regulations with respect to the application.\"", "[18] The Act is silent on the consequence of a decision rendered outside of the 60 days.", "[19] In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED found the 60 day limit in the Act was a procedural right. He found since s. 14 of the Act at that time provided for an appeal de novo there was an effective recourse for a breach of the 60 day limit. However, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED was decided before Rule 300 was amended to no longer permit appeals de novo.", "[20] In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, a Citizenship Judge refused to adjourn a hearing beyond the 60 days allowed for decision in the Act . The applicant was ineligible for citizenship until after completing probation for a criminal conviction and wanted the judge to wait. He would still have been on probation at the expiry of the 60 day period. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED considered the citizenship judge bound by the 60 day time limit. She stated FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED Sahota para. 20.", "[21] The Act states the judge \"shall\" render a decision within 60 days. Section 11 of the Interpretation Act states \"shall\" is imperative. However, as noted in The Interpretation of Statutes , there is room for two types of procedural requirements in statute: mandatory and directory: \"A strong line of distinction may be drawn between cases where the prescriptions of the Act affect the performance of a duty and where they relate to a privilege or power. Where powers, rights or immunities are granted with a direction that certain regulations, ... shall be complied with, it seems neither unjust nor inconvenient to exact a rigorous observance of them as essential to the acquisition of the right or authority conferred, ... But when a public duty is imposed and the statue requires that it shall be performed in a certain manner, or within a certain time , or under other specified conditions, such prescriptions may well be regarded as intended to be directory only in cases when injustice or inconvenience to others who have no control over those exercising the duty would result if such requirements were essential and imperative .: 10th Ed. (1953), at 376-77. As quoted in Principles of Administrative Law , 5th Ed. Jones and de Villar, 2009 (Carswell, Toronto).\" (emphasis added)", "[22] FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED considered this issue in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. He stated: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "[23] The Federal Court of Appeal upheld Justice Lemieux's finding that the provision in question was directory. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED.", "[24] The Act confers citizenship when an applicant meets the statutory requirements. Voiding citizenship decisions for being late would cause serious inconvenience and injustice for successful applicants. They would not be able to go about their affairs with the certain knowledge of citizenship. Equally important is the timely informing of unsuccessful applicants so that they may address shortcomings in their applications and apply anew.", "[25] In my view the 60 day requirement in s. 14(5) of the Act is directory. The Citizenship Judge did not lose jurisdiction because the delay exceeded the prescribed 60 days. Did the Citizenship Judge err in refusing the citizenship application?", "[26] In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED described the jurisprudence that has emerged on the question of residency required to qualify for citizenship: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "[27] A Citizenship Judge may apply any one of the three tests in deciding if the residency requirement is met. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , supra, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED.", "[28] The Judge may not \"blend\" the tests but may discuss alternatives in explaining the choice of test applied. In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "[29] The Act requires the Citizenship Judge to give reasons. This is especially important where the judge refuses an application for citizenship. Jurisprudence calls for clear reasons. In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED", "[30] The Citizenship Judge's reasons in this case are confusing. From the onset, Mr. Yang acknowledged his shortfall in days of physical presence in Canada. He requested the Citizenship Judge consider the centralized mode of living test. The Judge appeared to do so by reserving his decision and requesting more documents. However, the Judge then appears to dismiss any consideration of a centralized mode of living test and revert to a strict count of days.", "[31] While citizenship judges may select which residency test to apply, applicants are entitled to clear and meaningful reasons. In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED found a mixed message and lack of guidance provided in the decision led him to conclude the citizenship judge erred.", "[32] I am unable to say if the Citizenship Judge rejected the centralized mode of living approach because the Applicant gave what appears to be a waiver or because the documents and other information which had been submitted by Mr. Yang were inadequate. If the Citizenship Judge decided on the basis of an apparent waiver, that would be an error, since the judge is duty bound to consider the application. The Judge's use of the formalistic phrase \"For reasons above\" does not inform the Applicant in any meaningful way how his application for citizenship is deficient.", "[33] In my view the Citizenship Judge's decision does not provide the Applicant with clear and meaningful reasons as required by the Act and jurisprudence. In this regard, the judge erred.", "[34] The Citizenship Judge breached the 60 day time period for rendering a decision. However, the breach of a procedural right cannot give rise to a substantive right, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED.", "[35] Nothing in the Act remotely suggests citizenship can be achieved by any other means than what is set out in the legislation.", "[36] The record before this Court is not complete. For instance, the interview of Mr. Yang is not available. In these circumstances, I consider it appropriate to remit the hearing back for re-determination before another citizenship judge.", "[37] Finally, there remains the matter of addressing the failure to issue a decision within the statutory 60 day period. No explanation is offered for the fifteen month delay of the ruling on Mr. Yang's citizenship application.", "[38] Costs have been awarded because failure to comply with a directory requirement should not be sanctioned. In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Federal Court of Appeal awarded costs for the unsuccessful applicant at both levels of court because non-compliance with a directory requirement should not be sanctioned.", "[39] Accordingly, I find the Applicant is entitled to costs. CONCLUSION", "[40] I allow this appeal and direct that this matter be re-determined by a different Judge of the Citizenship Court.", "[41] Costs are awarded to the Applicant. JUDGMENT", "[42] THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that 1. the appeal is allowed; 2. this matter is remitted back to be re-determined by a different Judge of the Citizenship Court; and 3. costs are awarded to the Applicant. Appeal allowed. Editor: Gary W. McLaughlin/klf [End of document]"]}

{"id_": "056811", "body_str": ["[1] Muldoon, J. : The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs - Secretariat Inc. was granted leave to intervene in this hearing of the application for judicial review pursuant to an order by Madam Justice McGillis dated September 29, 1992. It supports the applicant herein, and both organizations were represented by the same counsel, Sidney Green, Q.C.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[2] The applicant seeks to have set aside the decision dated April 12, 1992, of an adjudicator appointed pursuant to Division XIV - Part III of the Canada Labour Code", "[3] The applicant mounts two attacks against the jurisdiction of the adjudicator, George N. Bass, Q.C., in this matter. The first attack is to the effect that the band, as respondent, whether by its council or by the totality of its individual members, does not come within the relevant sections of the Code which \"are applicable only to a federal work, undertaking or business and the Norway House Indian Band is not a federal work, undertaking or business\". The reference is obviously made to s. 167 in Part III of the Code , in which is included Division XIV. This issue relates to statutory jurisdiction. In the alternative, the applicant alleges that the adjudicator lost his jurisdiction because in his conduct of the hearing and in formulating his decision he \"erred in law in [12 various stated] respects\" and that his decision is based on erroneous facts and was made in a perverse or capricious manner without regard to the material before him as herein ... enunciated\". This alternative issue relates to the adjudicator's loss of jurisdiction because of his conduct.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Estoppel  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[4] The above recited issues are truly what are in serious contention in these proceedings. However, the respondent Duncan, among the \"points to be argued\", in her filed application record, raises the matter of the applicant's alleged estoppel \"from arguing before this Honourable Court that the adjudicator lacked jurisdiction due to the appellant [sic], as a party to the litigation, consenting to the adjudicator's jurisdiction at first instance\". Indeed in part II of his written decision, titled Jurisdiction, the adjudicator stated that the parties, by counsel, had agreed that \"Ms. Duncan's employment was in, or in connection with the operation of a federal work: s. 167(1) Code \" among other points tracking specific statutory provisions. The applicant contends that it is not estopped.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[5] In support of her contention that the applicant is estopped from pursuing any remedy on judicial review, the respondent cites <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a case of which Mr. Justice Idington, in dissent, wrote (p. 476) \"This appeal comes to us under somewhat peculiar circumstances\". So it did, but its ratio really has little to do with estoppel. That case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  taxation of the railway's bridge over the St. Lawrence River. The Ontario , R.S.O. 1914, c. 195, provided a series of appeals from imposed assessability: (1) township Court of Revision; (2) County Court Judge; (3) Ontario Railway and Municipal Board; and (4) the Divisional Court. The parties to the appeal, by consent, overleapt the second stage appeal to the county judge and presented themselves and the appeal to the board \"as if it [the appeal] had gone before the county judge and we're appealing against an adverse decision of the county judge\". At the outset of the Board stated it had \"no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the Court of Revision; an appeal lies to the Board only from the county judge\". However, it ultimately yielded in face of the parties' consent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[6] Chief Justice Sir Charles Fitzpatrick and Mr. Justice Idington dissented from the ratio of the majority holding, in effect, that where there is ab initio no jurisdiction vested in a tribunal to adjudicate a particular matter, all the consenting in the world cannot vest the tribunal with that jurisdiction, which was never conferred by appropriate legislation. Indeed the correctness of that posture is self-evident, for otherwise a tribunal created for a certain purpose (i.e. to entertain appeals from the county judge) could, if word got out, be recast into a different tribunal with a different caseload from that which the legislature created and foresaw. Consent cannot override the will of the legislature, provincial or federal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[7] The ratio of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  contains no admission that it acted without jurisdiction, and so, according to Messrs. Justices Davies, Duff and Anglin (all future Chief Justices of Canada), the appeals both to and from the Divisional Court appeared to be regularly taken. Davies, J., wrote concisely:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"On the question of jurisdiction I have reached the conclusion that the Divisional Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from the judgment of the Railway Board and to hear and determine the question of law raised, and that the appeal to this court from their judgment is competent.\" (pp. 472-73)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Mr. Justice Duff wrote this pithy passage:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"I have no difficulty in holding that the appeal lies. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is ex facie a judgment pronounced in an appeal regularly before the court after leave given under s. 80 of the . There is not a suggestion in the formal judgment, in the reasons for judgment, in the order giving leave to appeal that the court was acting otherwise than in the normal course. It must, therefore, be taken in the absence of evidence to the contrary, and there is none, that the appeal was heard and judgment was pronounced in the ordinary course of jurisdiction.\" (p. 493)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Mr. Justice Anglin came by his lights to the same conclusion, as reported on pp. 509-10.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[8] This is the first-instance curial review of the adjudicator's decision in this case and this court will not conclude the question of jurisdiction according to the parties' previous consent, nor on the basis of the applicant's estoppel from raising the question here. A strong, clear statement of the principle is found in paragraphs [31] through [34] of the decision of McNair, J., of this court, in Canadian  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 59. If the adjudicator had no jurisdiction as the applicant now asserts, then he never had jurisdiction and that consent would be immaterial, except perhaps as to costs. Costs here, on judicial review, are not to be awarded \"unless the court, for special reasons, so orders\" according to rule 1618. The court finds that the applicant is not estopped from contesting the adjudicator's jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Issue Of Statutory Jurisdiction  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[9] The Code's pertinent provisions obviously constitute the starting point for the enquiry into this issue. The second section of the Act \"2. In this Act,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 'federal work, undertaking or business' means any work, undertaking or business, that is within the legislative authority of Parliament, including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (i) a work, undertaking or business outside the exclusive legislative authority of the legislatures of the provinces, and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> The adjudicator herein was appointed and empowered to act, and restricted as to his jurisdiction, all pursuant to s. 242 of the . This provision is found within Division XIV \"Unjust Dismissal\", of Part III of that Act .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[10] Part III contains its own further pertinent definitions:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"166. In this Part,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 'employer' means any person who employs one or more employees;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"167(1) This Part applies  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (a) to employment in or in connection with the operation of any federal work, undertaking or business, other than a work, undertaking or business of a local or private nature, in the Yukon Territory or the Northwest Territories;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (b) to and in respect of employees who are employed in or in connection with any federal work, undertaking or business described in paragraph (a);  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (c) to and in respect of any employers of the employees described in paragraph (b); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"(3) Division XIV does not apply to or in respect of employees who are managers.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"168(1) This Part and all regulations made under this Part apply notwithstanding any other law or any custom, contract or arrangement, but nothing in this Part shall be construed as affecting any rights or benefits of an employee under any law, custom, contract or arrangement that are more favourable to the employee than his rights or benefits under this Part. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[11] Within Division XIV there are the following pertinent provisions:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"242(1) ... [appointment of adjudicator] ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"(2) An adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subs. (1)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (a) shall consider the complaint within such time as the Governor-in-Council may by regulation prescribe;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (b) shall determine the procedure to be followed, but shall give full opportunity to the parties to the complaint to present evidence and make submissions to the adjudicator and shall consider the information relating to the complaint; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (c) has, in relation to any complaint before the adjudicator, the powers conferred on the Canada Labour Relations Board, in relation to any proceeding before the Board, under paragraphs 16(a), (b) and (c).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"(3) Subject to subs. (3.1) [no adjudication where complainant was laid off] an adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subs. (1) shall  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (a) consider whether the dismissal of the person who made the complaint was unjust and render a decision thereon  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"(4) Where an adjudicator decides pursuant to subs. (3) that a person has been unjustly dismissed, the adjudicator may, by order, require the employer who dismissed the person to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (a) pay the person compensation not exceeding the amount of money that is equivalent to the remuneration that would, but for the dismissal, have been paid by the employer to the person;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (b) reinstate the person in his employ; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (c) do any other like thing that it is equitable to require the employer to do in order to remedy or counteract any consequence of the dismissal. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[12] It may seem strange that this litigation is even entertained by this court, since it seems to be contradicting the will of Parliament, in view of these provisions in Division XIV:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"243(1) Every order of an adjudicator appointed under subs. 242(1) is final and shall not be questioned or reviewed in any court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"(2) No order shall be made, process entered or proceeding taken in any court, whether by way of injunction, certiorari, prohibition, quo warranto or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or restrain an adjudicator in any proceedings of the adjudicator under s. 242. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Finally s. 244 provides that a copy of an adjudicator's order may be filed in this court, and registered to accord it the same force and effect as a judgment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[13] The undeniable and exclusive role of the Canadian judicature is not to usurp the function of the legislature, but rather to interpret officially the legislation which the latter enacts.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[14] The court presumes to transcend the protective provisions of s. 243 only if it be demonstrated that the adjudicator has so patently unreasonably stepped outside of the jurisdiction which Parliament conferred that the adjudicator can be clearly perceived to have perverted, evaded, avoided or contradicted the will of Parliament. After all, the High Court of Parliament can hardly be convened for such matters which are the ordinary grist for the adjudicatory mills of the superior courts. Parliament's protection of the adjudicators' process awards and decisions is simply intended to cover a multitude of adjudicators' \"sins\" so long as the manner of adjudication and the result be not patently unreasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[15] The above propositions are trite law as the jurisprudence discloses: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.B.R.(2d) 237; 51 A.P.R. 237; 97 D.L.R.(3d) 417; 79 C.L.L.C. 14,209 per Dickson, J., having kept in mind the statute's privative provision, at p. 237:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Put another way, was the Board's interpretation so patently unreasonable that construction cannot be rationally supported by the relevant legislation and demands intervention by the court upon review?\" (emphasis not in original text)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Teamsters Union Local 938 v. Massicotte , [1982] 1 S.C.R. 710; 44 N.R. 340 per Laskin, C.J., for the court at p. 719:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"I do not see in these passages [from the above  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case] any basis for questioning the jurisdiction exercised in the present case by the Canada Labour Relations Board. Essentially, this court has admonished that there must be no failure of natural justice (and there was none here) and that the Board should address itself to an issue arising under the legislation which it is charged to administer. If it has done this (as the Federal Court of Appeal held and, in my opinion, rightly so) there can be no jurisdictional infirmity when the Board is protected in its determinations by a privative clause. It may be wrong in law in interpreting the range of powers confided to it but its decisions are nonetheless immunized from judicial review. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 437; 89 C.L.L.C. 14,050; [1989] 6 W.W.R. 673; 40 Admin. L.R. 181, reveals three judgments for each \"pair\" of the six judges who adjudicated, with La Forest, J., and Dickson, C.J.C., having the slightly variant concurrence of Sopinka and Lamer, JJ. Here is a crucial passage written by La Forest, J., at pp. 1003-04:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Where, as here, an administrative tribunal is protected by a privative clause, this court has indicated that it will only review the decision of the Board only if that Board has either made an error in interpreting the provisions conferring jurisdiction on it, or has exceeded its jurisdiction by making a patently unreasonable error of law in the performance of its function; see Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 963 v. New Brunswick Liquor Corp. , [1979] 2 S.C.R. 277. The tribunal has the right to make errors, even serious ones, provided it does not act in a manner 'so patently unreasonable that its construction cannot be rationally supported by the relevant legislation and demands intervention by the court upon review' (p. 237). The test for review is a 'severe test'; see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 493. This restricted scope of review requires the courts to adopt a posture of deference to the decisions of the tribunal. Curial deference is more than just a fiction courts resort to when they are in agreement with the decisions of the tribunal. Mere disagreements with the result arrived at by the tribunal does not make that result 'patently unreasonable'. The courts must be careful to focus their inquiry on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal, and not on their agreement with it. The emphasis should be not so much on what result the tribunal has arrived at, but on how the tribunal arrived at that result. Privative clauses, such as those contained in ss. 31 and 34 of the Code , are permissible exercises of legislative authority and, to the extent that they restrict the scope of curial review within their constitutional jurisdiction, the court should respect that limitation and defer to the Board.\" (emphasis not in original text)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Here is the slightly variant, but \"important respect\" in which Sopinka, J., differs from his colleague, at pp. 1017-18:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"While I agree generally with La Forest, J., on the principles underlying the scope and standard of review of labour board decisions, I cannot agree that it is always necessary for the reviewing court to ignore its own view of the merits of the decision under review. Any adjudication upon the reasonableness of a decision must involve an evaluation of the merits. Reasonableness is not a quality that exists in isolation. When a court says that a decision under review is \"reasonable\" or \"patently unreasonable\" it is making a statement about the logical relationship between the grounds of the decision and premises thought by the court to be true. Without the reference point of an opinion (if not a conclusion) on the merits, such a relative statement cannot be made.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"I share La Forest, J.'s, opinion of the importance of curial deference in the review of specialist tribunals' decisions. But, in my view, curial deference does not enter the picture until the court finds itself in disagreement with the tribunal. Only then is it necessary to consider whether the error (so found) is within or outside the boundaries of reasonableness. The test is, as La Forest, J., points out, citing <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a 'severe test'. But even here an appreciation of the merits is not irrelevant. Lamer, J., speaking for himself and McIntyre, J.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , stated at pp. 494-95:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> '... though all errors do not lead to unreasonable findings, every unreasonable finding results from an error (whether of law, fact, or a combination of the two), which is unreasonable.'  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"So long as the court is satisfied with the correctness of the tribunals' decision, any reference to reasonableness is superfluous. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [1991] 1 S.C.R. 614; 123 N.R. 161 presents a 6 to 1 split decision, with Sopinka, J., for the majority, being reported thus at pp. 629-30:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"In determining whether there has been a simple error in interpreting a provision conferring or limiting jurisdiction, as in determining whether jurisdiction has been exceeded by a patently unreasonable error , a pragmatic, functional approach must be adopted. [Emphasis not in original text.] This emerges from the following statement of Beetz, J., in Bibeault [[1988] 2 S.C.R. 1048] (at pp. 1088-89):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> At this stage, the court examines not only the wording of the enactment conferring jurisdiction on the administrative tribunal, but the purpose of the statute creating the tribunal, the reason for its existence, the area of expertise of its members and the nature of the problem before the tribunal . At this initial stage a pragmatic or functional analysis is just as suited to a case in which an error is alleged in the interpretation of a provision limiting the administrative tribunal's jurisdiction: in a case where a patently unreasonable error is alleged on a question within the jurisdiction of the tribunal, as in a case, where simple error is alleged regarding a provision limiting that jurisdiction, the first step involves determining the tribunal's jurisdiction.' (Emphasis added)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Adopting a pragmatic and functional approach to the construction of these provisions, I have come to the conclusion that Parliament did not intend to confer jurisdiction on the Board with respect to the labour relations of employees who are not members of the Public Service. The Board by an error of law has assumed jurisdiction that it was not intended to have. Its decision is, therefore, reviewable. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Mr. Justice Sopinka, for the majority explained quite clearly why they did not defer to the decision of the P.S.S.R.B. in that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  definition of the word 'employee' provided by s. 2, is practically decisive in this case. Section 33 is intended to enable the Board to resolve any question as to whether an employee or class of employees is or is not included in a bargaining unit. In the absence of a definition of 'employee', it could be argued that the Board could determine who is an employee on the basis of tests that are generally employed in labour matters. These tests are customarily employed to resolve a dispute as to whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor. The express definition of 'employee', however, shows a clear intention by Parliament that it has decided the category of employee over which the Board is to have jurisdiction. It is restricted to persons employed in the Public Service and who are not covered by the Canada Labour Code . The Board's function by the very words of s. 33 is not to determine who is an employee but rather whether employees who come within the definition provided, are included in a particular bargaining unit. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> However one looks at the P.S.S.R.B.'s conduct in this P.S.A.C. case, it is patently obvious that the P.S.S.R.B. blundered outside of the jurisdiction which Parliament intended by enactment to confer on that board.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[16] Mr. Justice Cory in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , is reported at p. 957 as holding that on the question of its jurisdiction to entertain the complaint put before it, if the C.L.R. Board made a simple error then it exceeded its jurisdiction. Regarding decisions made by a tribunal acting quite within its jurisdiction, the reviewing court must ensure that the tribunal's decision was not patently unreasonable. If the question of law at issue is within the tribunal's jurisdiction, it will exceed it only if it errs in a patently unreasonable manner.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[17] The Supreme Court continued to refine the jurisprudence even after the judgment in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 1, presents a solid five-judge majority with somewhat variant opinions by Lamer, C.J.C., and Cory, J., this judgment being unanimous in the result to dismiss both the employer's appeal and the union's ill-founded and unargued cross-appeal. This case considered the jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The majority spoke through Mr. Justice La Forest, who wrote (at pp. 250-51) the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"The court was not asked to review the arbitrator's interpretation of the [collective] agreement at hand. Had that issue properly been before this court, I have no doubt that the scope of our review of that aspect of the arbitration award would have been a narrow one - we would have embarked on a patent unreasonability enquiry. However, on the more general level at which the jurisdictional debate was engaged in this court, I am of the view that the appropriate scrutiny of the arbitrator's decision is to a standard of correctness. My reasons for this position are set out below, but at this juncture I should perhaps comment on this stratified approach to the issues arising from the arbitrator's award.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"To begin, I would not wish my conclusions on the standard of review in this case to be taken as a retreat from the deferential approach to judicial review of administrative tribunals since the decision of this Court in Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 963 v. New Brunswick Liquor Corp. , [1979] 2 S.C.R. 227. Nor are the conclusions here inconsistent with the previous statements by this court as to the appropriate scope of judicial review of arbitration awards made pursuant to s. 44 of the Act . This court has stated in previous cases that courts should, as a matter of policy, defer to the expertise of the arbitrator is questions relating to the interpretation of collective agreements; ... It is clear that an arbitrator has jurisdiction stricto sensu to interpret the provisions of a collective agreement in the course of determining the arbitrability of matters under that agreement. In that case the arbitrator in acting within his or her 'home territory', and any judicial review of that interpretation must only be to a standard of patent unreasonableness. But this is a different case. Here, the viability and subsistence of the collective agreement is challenged. The company alleges that regardless of the interpretation of the agreement, it cannot survive to serve as the basis for this arbitration. The collective agreement is the foundation of the arbitrator's jurisdiction, and in determining that it exists or subsists the arbitrator must be correct. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> La Forest, J., on the principal appeal concluded, at p. 305:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"To summarize, I am of the view that retirement rights can, if contemplated by the terms of a collective agreement, survive the expiration of that agreement. Moreover, although it is not strictly necessary to decide the point in this appeal, I would also find that these surviving rights vest at the time of retirement, and would survive subsequent collective bargaining that purported to divest such rights. As such, I have concluded that the arbitrator's general propositions in this respect were correctly stated, and the arbitrator had jurisdiction to hear the union's grievance. Of course, I make no comment on whether the terms of the agreement between the company and the union do in fact create such a vested right. That is a question for the arbitrator to decide when the arbitration hearing proceeds on the merits. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[18] Hard on the heels of the Dayco <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a four-to-one decision with Mr. Justice Gonthier writing for the majority. It was a case concerning the powers of the Canada Labour Relations Board to compel production of documents prior to the commencement of a hearing, which came on appeal from the Federal Court of Appeal. So far as the principle of reviewing questions of even \"protected\" administrative jurisdiction by ordinary criteria been advanced, that it suffices merely to quote a brief and preliminary analysis expressed by Gonthier, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> first calls for a consideration of its wording. As the issue goes to the jurisdiction of the Board, the standard governing the judicial review of the Board's order is one of correctness: U.E.S. Local 298 v. Bibeault , [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1048, and most recently <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[19] The standard of correctness for founding the adjudicator's jurisdiction means simply that the adjudicator must not make any error in exercising the powers conferred by and under Division XIV. It is presumed that Parliament does not will the exceeding of those carefully crafted powers (and limitations) and that its privative clauses cannot have protection of such excesses as their purpose.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[20] The adjudicator exercised jurisdiction; and the applicant's complaint about that essentially, comes at last to the interpretation of the statutory provisions. Did the adjudicator act in consonance with those interpretations? The complaint asserts that the adjudicator had no jurisdiction because the applicant Indian band is simply not \"any federal work, undertaking or business\" as set forth in Code s. 167, above recited.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[21] In this regard, the applicant's counsel admits:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"We don't deny we are the employer. There is no [dispute]; we are not saying that we are not the employer. You can forget that. We are the employer.\" (Transcript: p. 155, lines 5 through 7)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> He further stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"we will concede, that the activities of the Band council fall under the legislative jurisdiction of the federal government (sic) [Parliament?]. So he [respondents' counsel] needn't prove that. We agree with that.\" (Transcript: p. 160, lines 14 though 17)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> The applicant's counsel summarized as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"She [Ms. Duncan] is an employee of the Band, not an employee of the Minister. The Band operates under the authority of the Indian Act . ... [The court: - so did the complainant act under the authority of the Indian Act , whatever the Band delegated her to do?] That's right. No problem with that. ... All of it is under the legislation of, competence of the Parliament of Canada. No problem there.\" (Transcript: p. 167, lines 1 through 10)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[22] The question to be answered here now comes to this, in light of the applicant's counsel's admission that the Band, or Band Council has been, at all material times, Ms. Duncan's employer: was her employment \"in or in connection with the operation of any federal work, undertaking or business\" as described in ss. 167(1)(a) and (b)? If the answer be affirmative, the adjudicator's statutory jurisdiction is affirmed; if it be negative, his statutory jurisdiction is negated. Courts interpret the law authoritatively. The most authoritative judgments affirm.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[23] In the case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 15 Sask.R. 37, it appears that the provincial board purported to certify the carpenters' union as representing the majority of employees in the carpenters' unit employed by the band council, and required it to bargain collectively. The band council applied to quash the LRB's orders on the principal ground that \"the regulation of the labour relations in issue falls under federal and not provincial jurisdiction and, accordingly is beyond the authority of the provincial board\". The judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal was written by Mr. Justice Cameron. He assumed that the band council was the employer of the carpenters, that which, qualitatively, the applicant's counsel admits herein.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[24] Ordinarily in Canada's distinct division of federal-provincial powers, labour relations, being considered to be a matter of \"property and civil rights\", are accordingly a matter of provincial jurisdiction. In this instance, the employer is a creature of Parliament, and the employment operates under the Indian Act as the applicant's counsel expressed it: all of it is under the competence of the Parliament of Canada. Here is the essence of the Whitebear case. It is true that the court's task was to decide whether the provincial board could exercise jurisdiction, but in the result, the court found federal jurisdiction, and had so to find, to the exclusion of provincial jurisdiction. The finding of federal jurisdiction over the employment of the band's member-carpenters was an essential finding, because only that could displace the authority of the provincial labour relations board.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[25] Cameron, J.A. recited the statutory provisions which were then the equivalents of ss. 167(1) and (2), and he turned to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 85, in which Mr. Justice Ritchie for the majority is quoted:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"In my view, it would not be proper to seek to put a restricted meaning on any of the words 'work, undertaking or business' as used in the so as to exclude from their scope all activities of municipal corporations. Some of these operations, like waterworks and sewage systems, undoubtedly come within any concept of 'work'. Others, like protection or sanitation services, cannot be excluded from the scope of 'undertakings' without doing violence to the language, and 'business' has been said to mean 'almost anything which is an occupation, as distinguished from a pleasure - anything which is an occupation or duty which requires attention ...\" (per Lindley, L.J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  applied to operations carried on without an expectation of profit. In my view, it would be contrary to the whole concept of classifying employees for jurisdictional purposes by reference to the character of the operation, to attempt to make a distinction depending upon whether the employer is a private company or a public authority. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Then Cameron, J.A., concluded the Whitebear judgment in these terms:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"In the light of these observations, I believe that, in the context of the Canada Labour Code , the operations of the Whitebear Band Council may be classified as 'a federal work, undertaking or business', and accordingly the labour relations in issue are subject to this Act . <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"For these reasons I am of the opinion that the Trade Union Act of Saskatchewan is inapplicable in this case, since power to regulate the labour relations in question forms in integral part of primary federal jurisdiction over 'Indians' and 'Lands reserved for the Indians', and such labour relations are subject to the Canada Labour Code . It follows that the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board acted without jurisdiction in purporting to make the orders it did, and accordingly I would quash those orders, with costs of this application to the appellant. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[26] The judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , is complex in that it may illustrate that the conclusions of the Whitebear decision were in truth asserted by the Federal Court of Appeal in this case [1981] 1 F.C. 225. Mr. Justice Martland, writing for the Supreme Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Federal Court of Appeal the respondents' main ground of attack upon the Board's orders was that the labour relations in issue were not within federal legislative competence, that the Code did not apply to them and that, in consequence, the Board had no jurisdiction to make the orders which were in dispute. This submission was not accepted by the court. Heald and Le Dain, JJ., held that the Code was applicable in respect of the labour relations in issue. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Adopted apparently by the Supreme Court of Canada, that conclusion is binding on this court by authority of one or other, or both of those appellate courts.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[27] In matters of public law, such as this, courts ought really not to proceed on admissions by the parties, as they may do in private law cases, where the litigation \"belongs\" only to the contending private litigants. So in order to relieve that anxiety about the applicant's admitted status of an employer (but, alas, in no way to shorten these reasons) the court will recite the passages on the last page (78) of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  enact by-laws for the enforcement of which it is necessary to employ staff. In fact, the Council does engage employees to do work for it and it pays them. In view of these circumstances, for the purposes of the Code , it is my opinion that the Council could properly be considered to be an employer within the meaning of that Act . I am fortified in that conclusion by the provision contained in s. 27(7) of the Interpretation Act , R.S.C. 1979, c. I-23, that words in the singular include the plural. The word 'person' in the Code therefore includes 'persons'. The council is a designated body of persons which is given a specific role under the provisions of the Indian Act .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"The respondents argued before this court that it was the Band and not the Council which should have been certified by the Board. However, as Le Dain, J., points out, if the Council cannot be treated as the employer because it lacks corporate status, the same must be said of the Band. If lack of corporate status prevents a body from being an employer under the Code , then there would be a situation in which Indian employees doing work for the Council or the Band would be denied the rights conferred by the Code .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"The decision as to whether the Council or the Band should be regarded as the employer was one which is within the jurisdiction of the Board to determine under s. 118(p) of the Code , previously cited. It was for the Board to decide who was the employer, and the Board did so.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal. The appellant should be entitled to its costs in this court and in the Federal Court of Appeal. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> What is set aside is not what was adopted or accepted on p. 74, but rather the Appeal Division's majority decision holding that the St. Regis Band Council was not a \"person\" and therefore not an \"employer\". The Supreme Court set that aside and held that the Council and/or Band was a \"person\" capable of being a statutory \"employer\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[28] A similar case was decided by the Alberta Court of Appeal, for whom Mr. Justice Belzil wrote the judgment in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Three relatively brief passages will suffice to encapsulate the ratio of that scholarly judgment:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"The appellant, Paul Band, is a legally constituted band under the Indian Act .... It was charged under the Alberta Labour Act ... for failing to pay to two employees wages earned by them while employed by the band as special constables on the Paul Wabumun Indian Reserve No. 133.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"The band was convicted in summary conviction proceedings in Provincial Court [reported at [1982] 4 C.N.L.R. 120]: it was fined, and judgments were awarded against it for the wages due. The conviction and judgments were substantiated on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench. The appeal comes before us on points of law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"The principal issue raised in this appeal is whether the Alberta Labour Act applies to the labour relations of the 'band' and its special constables. It is on this constitutional issue that the intervenants appeared and that the main submissions were made before us, and it is therefore on this issue that I propose to determine this appeal. (pp. 541-42)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Band councils are created under the Indian Act and derive their authority to operate qua band councils exclusively from that Act . In the exercise of their powers they are concerned with the administration of band affairs on their respective reserves whether under direct authority or Parliament or as administrative arms of the minister. They have no other source of power. Band councils are thus within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction and control of the Parliament of Canada over 'Indians, and lands reserved for Indians' assigned to it by s. 91(24) of the , and such councils are thus immune to provincial legislation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"There can accordingly be no doubt that the normal operations or activities of the Paul Band Council were those which it was carrying on under authority of the Indian Act and thus constituted a federal undertaking or business. That the special constables in question may have been enforcing provincial status on the reserve is irrelevant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"The court was urged to adopt the reasoning of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Band Council , supra. In that case, the operation of the band council under review arose under an agreement between the council and the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs whereby the council agreed to manage a capital spending programme of house construction, etc., on the reserve funded by the department. While I do not disagree with that decision, I have not relied on it because different considerations may apply. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> If different considerations do apply, they would seemingly arise out of the distinction between the matter of a provincial offence which was the subject of the Paul Band case, and the recruitment and union representation and provincial certification issues central to the Whitebear case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[29] What is notable about the two cited appellate decisions is that the exception to the norm of provincial hegemony in labour relations (\"property and civil rights in the province\", head 13 s. 92, ) had to be found not on some ethereal jurisdictional void, for that would have ipso facto confirmed the norm, but on a positive finding that the labour relations field in regard to \"Indians and lands reserved for the Indians\", (head 24, s. 91, ) manifests not only federal competence, but federal paramountcy. So held Mr. Justice Pinard in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras. [25] and [26], p. 39. That positive finding of federal legislative jurisdiction was, and is, quite necessary to the exclusion of provincial jurisdiction. Constitutional law, like Nature, abhors a vacuum. Further, it was, and is, necessary in order to find federal jurisdiction, further to find that the creation of Indian bands, councils, and their workings do constitute a federal work, undertaking or business.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[30] It is not straining the sense of \"business\", to assert that the business of each compartment of governance in this federal State is what it is to do, what powers it may wield pursuant to the Constitution. Business in this sense does not connote commercial business for profit, but the constitutional array of legitimate legislative subjects of Parliament or the legislatures, and the activities generated therefrom.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[31] So, also, a governmental or legislative undertaking is not necessarily a commercial enterprise as that word may be understood in certain legislation regulating business and commerce where it may carry that connotation. The filed affidavit of Margaret Jane Balfour is instructive and persuasive in this regard. The distinction was noted by this court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 357:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Here surely resides the essence of 'undertaking' promulgated in the two [regulatory] statutes. It imports the aspect of justiciability for failure to meet a commercial obligation and is, therefore, to be distinguished from those undertakings mentioned in the Constitution which signal the division of legislative powers. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> That question of \"undertaking\" was considered among other aspects, on appeal. It was not particularly mentioned by the Appeal Division and the appeal was dismissed [1985] 2 F.C. 185; 59 N.R. 212 at pp. 198-99.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[32] The same jurisdictional conclusion, regarding \"business\", was drawn by Madam Justice Desjardins for herself and Mr. Justice Mahoney in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) at p. 6, paras. [15] in part, and [16]:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"[15] Having reached a conclusion in favour of federal legislative competence I am also of the view that the Canada Labour Code occupies the field.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"[16] In the case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 738 S.C.R., Pigeon, J., for the court accepted the following definition of 'business' given by Lindley, L.J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  distinguished from a pleasure - anything which is an occupation or duty which requires attention ...'. Pigeon, J., added that the word 'business' is often applied to operations carried on without an expectation of profit. The Agency, in my view, qualifies under the word 'Federal business'. The Band is an employer under the Code <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). I therefore conclude that the adjudicator had jurisdiction under the Canada Labour Code . <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[33] So, this court also finds that the creation, activities and operations of the applicant, and the work for which the applicant employed Ms. Duncan, all constitute a \"federal work, undertaking or business\" within the meaning of s. 2(i) of the Canada Labour Code . In light of the logic and in regard to the jurisprudence, to hold otherwise would be perverse. The applicant's objection to Mr. Bass' jurisdiction as an adjudicator is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[34] It does not appear that notification of a constitutional question to be litigated was given to the provincial attorneys-general. That omission must be remedied by the appellant, if an appeal be taken on this matter. In her order granting intervener status Madam Justice McGillis did not accord the intervener any right of appeal, because, no doubt, the then would-be intervener did not invoke rule 1611(3), even although its notice of application refers to rule 1611(1). The intervener should obtain counsel's advice on this matter: it might not even now be too late to apply, if so advised, upon demonstrating proper grounds. The Supreme Court's decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  des  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.B.R.(2d) 271; 177 A.P.R. 271, deals with interveners' rights of appeal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[35] Notification of a constitutional question, to be given to the federal and provincial attorneys-general, is provided and governed by s. 57 of the Federal Court Act , and by rules 301.1 and 1101.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Issues Of Loss Of Jurisdiction For Allegedly Patent Unreasonableness  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>"]}

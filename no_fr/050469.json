{"id_": "050469", "body_str": ["[1] Le juge Pinard", "[2]", "[3]", "[4]", "[5]", "[6]", "[8]", "[9]", "", "[10]", "[11]", "[12]", "[13]", "[14]", "[15]", "[17] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the IRB), dated April 15, 2005, ruling that the applicant is not a “Convention refugee” or a “person in need of protection” within the meaning of sections 96 and 97, respectively, of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.", "[2] Hanane El Balazi (the applicant) is a citizen of Morocco who claims she has a fear of persecution in her country because of her membership in a particular social group, women who are victims of family violence.", "[3] The IRB found that the applicant was not credible. More specifically, the IRB: - did not believe the applicant’s explanation for her delay in claiming asylum in Canada and found that it was implausible that the applicant, who feared being killed by the father of her former fiancé and who has lived in Canada since 2001, would await the expiration of her visa before requesting protection in Canada; and - also concluded that it was implausible that the applicant’s mother was unable to give her news about her father or the father of her former fiancé.", "[4] It appears on the face of the decision in question, therefore, that the IRB gave only two reasons in support of its finding of non-credibility.", "[5] The applicant argues that the IRB erred in respect of the first of these reasons, that is, the delay between August 2003, when she returned to Canada after visiting her family in Morocco, and July 2004, when she claimed asylum.", "[6] The respondent correctly says that the IRB may take into account a claimant’s conduct when assessing his or her statements and actions, and that in certain circumstances a claimant’s conduct may be sufficient, in itself, to dismiss a refugee claim ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  law also indicates that possession of a visa (the IRB seems to have accepted the applicant’s testimony that she believed her student visa would expire on July 31, 2004 and not December 31, 2003) is a factor that has led the Court, in the past, to determine that such a delay was reasonable.", "[8] For example, the Federal Court of Appeal, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Applicant's claim, according to its reasons, on the sole ground that he had not made it in 1981 when he went to Greece and boarded his ship. This, for the Board, would show that the Appellant's fear was not real and that his contention to that effect, his having waited so long before making it, was not credible. While we do not dispute that the delay in making a claim for refugee status may be an important factor to take into consideration in trying to assess the seriousness of an applicant's contentions, we disagree completely with the Board's reasoning in the present case. It seems to us obvious that the Applicant's fear is in relation to his having to return to the Seychelles and as long as he had his sailor's papers and a ship to sail on, he did not have to seek protection.", "[9] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  I stated as well:", "[9] . . . Finally, the explanations given by the plaintiff about the delay in making the claim were solidly based on evidence and seem quite reasonable to me: she was entitled to be in Canada on her student visa and, as appears from her physician's letter, she was suffering from severe depression. . . .", "[10] In the case at bar, the IRB, in my opinion, erred in ruling that the delay in claiming undermined the credibility of the applicant, the holder of a student visa.", "[11] The applicant argues that the IRB, in its second reason, also erred in finding that it was implausible that her mother was unable to give her news about her father or the father of her former fiancé.", "[12] The respondent says it was reasonable for the IRB to find that, if the applicant’s story was true, her mother, “who is very close to her and knows the suffering the claimant would experience at her father’s hands”, would be capable of giving her a little more information.", "[13] In my opinion, this reason alone is far from sufficient to support a finding of non-credibility. It would be patently unreasonable to find that the applicant is not credible solely because she testified that her mother did not give her news of her long-divorced father or of the father of her former fiancé, when she telephoned her. In my opinion, that is a completely negligible and inconsequential issue in the context of the applicant’s testimony as a whole.", "[14] In addition, the respondent identified seven other grounds to try to justify the IRB’s decision of non-credibility. The respondent argues that, although these contradictions and improbabilities were not noted by the IRB in its decision, they are clear from the evidence put before it and this Court must consider them in determining whether the panel’s decision was rationally supported by the evidence at its disposal.", "[15] However, absent any reasons, an applicant has no means of identifying what led the panel to the decision it made. The duty to give written reasons for a decision is intended to allow the claimant to know in timely fashion the specific reasons why his claim was denied, so that he can assess his chances before making efforts and incurring expenses in a new proceeding ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  specific reasons why it found that the applicant was not credible. The reasons given by the IRB are the only indications by which its finding can be assessed. It is not for this Court to look for additional ones in order to support the decision of this panel. This Court need not assess the new contradictions and implausibilities cited by the respondent if they were not raised at the IRB hearing and were not considered in its reasons.", "[17] Since I am of the opinion, therefore, that it was patently unreasonable for the IRB to reach the conclusion that it did, solely on the basis of the two reasons stated in its decision, one of them erroneous and the other without consequence, the application for judicial review is allowed, the decision in question is set aside and the matter is referred back to the IRB for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.

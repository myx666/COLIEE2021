She is alleging that her common-law spouse of 20 years, with whom she has two children, physically and sexually abused her for 16 years.", "[4] She stated that she never went to the hospital or to a shelter for abused women. She never filed a complaint with the authorities regarding the death threats made by her spouse because he had privileged contacts with the police and paid them bribes.", "[5] The applicant left her spouse in the beginning of 2007 and went to live with her sister. She arrived in Canada on May 23, 2007, as a visitor. A few months later, she filed her refugee claim. Impugned decision", "[6] In its decision, the panel noted that the applicant's allegations of violence were not corroborated by any documentary evidence. It also criticized her for not making any effort to avail herself of protection from her family or from public agencies that focus on domestic violence.", "[7] Referring to the documentary evidence, the panel accepted that conjugal violence in Colombia was a serious problem in 2004. However, it did not accept that the applicant did not go to the police. Furthermore, it considered that the documentary evidence provided by the applicant was in relation to the real estate transactions between her common-law spouse and one of her daughters who lives in Canada as a permanent resident.", "[8] Assessing the evidence is within the jurisdiction of the panel.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , credibility findings made by the panel regarding a claimant continue to be subject to deference by the Court and are reviewable on the standard of reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 55, 57, 62 and 64; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] F.C.J. No. 147 (QL) at paragraph 23). Therefore, the Court will intervene only if the decision does not fall within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 47).", "[9] In the case at bar, the applicant's credibility is not in dispute. The panel did not find any contradiction, inconsistency or implausibility in the applicant's account. Moreover, the respondent admitted at paragraph 7 of his supplementary memorandum that the panel did not call into question the credibility of the applicant's statements.", "[10] The respondent argues that the applicant's failure to provide evidence in support of her allegations was a fatal flaw under subsection 100(4) of the Act and section 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules , SOR/2002-228, which require that documents be provided in support of a claim.", "[11] He added that the panel's decision is not unreasonable merely because it noted that the applicant had not made any effort to avail herself of protection from her own family or from public agencies that assist abused women.", "[12] It is important to recall that a claimant's testimony is presumed to be true unless there are implausibilities, inconsistencies or contradictions ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J. No. 1729 (QL) at paragraph 16; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] F.C.J. No. 1131 (QL) at paragraphs 6 to 8).", "[13] A panel cannot draw a negative inference from the mere fact that a party failed to produce any extrinsic documents corroborating his or her allegations, except when the applicant's credibility is at issue ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1278 (QL) at paragraph 6).", "[14] Here, as the applicant's credibility was not at issue, the Court believes that the panel erred in requiring that she produce evidence to corroborate her allegations.", "[15] In other words, under the particular circumstances of this case, the panel's negative inference drawn from the lack of evidence corroborating the abuse committed by the applicant's common-law spouse warrants the Court's intervention.", "[16] It is also true that the applicant filed documents concerning the real estate transactions between her common-law spouse and her daughter. However, the panel did not comment on the allegations of manipulation and threats by the common-law spouse surrounding these transactions as set out in the applicant's PIF (pages 24 and 25, Tribunal Record) or on the e-mail he sent her on March 21, 2007 (pages 84 and 85, Tribunal Record).", "[17] No question for certification was proposed and this application does not give rise to any. JUDGMENT", "[18] THE COURT ORDERS that the application for judicial review be allowed. The matter is referred back for redetermination by a differently constituted panel. No question is certified.

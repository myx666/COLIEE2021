{"id_": "068646", "body_str": ["[1] Teitelbaum, J. : This is an application by the defendants to strike out paragraphs 9, 10, 13, 17(c), 17(d), 18(b), 18(c) and Schedule \"A\" of the Amended Statement of Claim pursuant to rule 419 of the Federal Court Rules , C.R.C. 1978, c. 663, as amended, on the grounds that the aforementioned paragraphs and Schedule: i) disclose no reasonable cause of action; ii) are immaterial or redundant; iii) are frivolous or vexatious; iv) may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or v) are an abuse of the process of the court.", "[2] In the alternative, the defendants have applied for an Order pursuant to rule 415(3) requiring the plaintiff to supply particulars with respect to paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 of the Amended Statement of Claim.", "[3] According to the Notice of Motion, the defendants applied to have paragraph 18(f) of the Amended Statement of Claim struck out. However, counsel for the defendants advised the court that the defendants would not be seeking to have this paragraph struck as part of the application before me.", "[4] At the outset of the application, the plaintiff argued that the defendants have not provided any grounds in support of the motion for particulars and on that basis alone the motion for particulars must be dismissed. According to the grounds outlined in the Notice of Motion, the Statement of Claim was filed on January 30, 1995 and served on the defendants on February 13, 1995. By letter dated February 17, 1995, the defendants requested particulars with respect to the allegations set out in paragraphs 7, 8, 13, 14 and 15 of the Statement of Claim; and an Amended Statement of Claim wherein paragraphs 9, 17(c), 17(d), 18(b), 18(c), 18(f) and Schedule \"A\" of the original Statement of Claim were to be deleted. This letter is exhibit \"A\" attached to the affidavit of Claire Gorden and filed in support of the defendants' motion. By letter dated March 2, 1995, the defendants were served with an Amended Statement of Claim together with particulars in respect of paragraphs 7 and 8 and were refused the particulars sought with respect to allegations outlined in paragraphs 13, 14 and 15. The defendants are of the view that the Amended Statement of Claim and the response to the request for particulars are inadequate. The defendants maintain it is clear on the face of the Amended Statement of Claim what the grounds for the motion are and that the plaintiff is aware of the grounds for the motion as they are outlined in the defendants' letter of February 17, 1995.", "[5] Although the grounds for the motion could have been more detailed, I am satisfied, based on the letter of February 17, 1995, that the plaintiff is more than aware of the particulars required by the defendants and why these particulars are required. As such, there is no prejudice to the plaintiff in that it could not be said counsel is deprived of the right to reply to the defendants' motion in an informed manner. Moreover, the jurisprudence is clear that one cannot make a motion to strike a motion. In this regard, I note the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  General of Canada brought a motion seeking an order striking out the applicant's motion. Dubé, J., was of the opinion that the Federal Court Rules do not provide for such a motion; that rule 419 may be used for striking out actions or pleadings but does not provide for striking out motions and that one must therefore argue against the merits of the motion at its hearing. Further, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 196, the court noted that rule 419 applied only to actions and not to applications.", "[6] The plaintiff's action against the defendants is based on the plaintiff's alleged rights in an unregistered trademark \"Copperhead\" and in its trade name Copperhead Brewing Co. Ltd. associated with alcoholic brewery beverages, namely beer. The conduct complained of by the plaintiff relates to the defendants' use of \"copper\" in association with beer. According to the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiff has used its trademark and trade name in Canada in association with beer since October 1993. Essentially the allegations outlined in the Amended Statement of Claim relate to a passing off action against the defendants pursuant to ss. 7(b) and 7(c) of the Trade-marks Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, as amended. Section 7(b) is considered to be the statutory expression of the law of passing off and s. 7(c) refers to a substitution of the plaintiff's goods by the defendant and is essentially a sub-category of the common law of passing off ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.I.P.R. 3 (T.D.), at p. 8). The sections are reproduced below: \"7. No person shall (b) direct public attention to his wares, services or business in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause confusion in Canada, at the time he commenced so to direct attention to them, between his wares, services or business and the wares, services or business of another; (c) pass off other wares or services as and for those ordered or requested; ...\"", "[7] Therefore, the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants are engaging in a course of conduct so as to direct attention to their wares and lead to a likelihood of confusion between their wares and the wares of the plaintiff as well as substituting their wares for those of the plaintiff when consumers have asked for the plaintiff's goods or wares.", "[8] There is no dispute that the pleadings in a statement of claim are taken to be proven and that the court should strike pleadings only in clear and obvious cases. Rule 408 provides that every pleading must contain a precise statement of the material facts on which the party pleading relies. As correctly noted by the defendants, if the material facts set out in the statement of claim clearly reveal no cause of action, it must be struck out ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.), at p. 242. Further, pleadings must do more than simply make statements of law or restate sections of an Act that the party is relying on in the action.", "[9] The defendants' basic position is that the impugned paragraphs of the Amended Statement of Claim do not support any cause of action in respect of which this court has jurisdiction. The defendants also maintain the paragraphs are irrelevant and immaterial to the passing off action and will only serve to prejudice, embarrass and delay the trial of the action.", "[10] More specifically, the defendants argue that paragraphs 9, 18(b) and 18(c) of the Amended Statement of Claim are irrelevant to the determination of the issues in dispute, namely the passing off action and that registrability of the plaintiff's trademark is a question for the Registrar of Trademarks. Paragraph 9 reads as follows: \"On January 19, 1995, 'Copperhead' filed an application to register the trademark 'Copperhead' in association with beer based on use since at least as early as October 8, 1993. A copy of the application as filed on January 19, 1995, is attached hereto as Schedule A and forms part of this Statement of Claim.\"", "[11] The defendants submit that the mere fact that the plaintiff has filed a trademark application is irrelevant to a passing off action, as there are no rights that flow to the plaintiff.", "[12] The plaintiff argues that its application to register the trademark \"Copperhead\" is material and relevant to the action, which it claims is based on acts of unfair competition by the defendants, namely the adoption of the allegedly confusing trademark \"copper\" for beer. The plaintiff maintains that on the basis of s. 20 of the Federal Court Act and s. 53.2 of the Trade-marks Act the court has the power to grant the plaintiff relief in cases where any act has been done contrary to the Trade-marks Act . The plaintiff alleges that not only will the plaintiff suffer damage in terms of lost sales and profits but in the context of its application to register the trademark \"Copperhead\", the trademark may lose its distinctiveness. As such, the plaintiff submits that the court is entitled to consider the plaintiff's application to register the mark in the context of the impact the defendants' action may have on the plaintiff's ability to register its mark.", "[13] I agree that as this is a passing off action, the parties must rely on the law of unfair competition, namely s. 7(b) and (c) to obtain their relief and that the question of the status of a trademark registration must first be dealt with in the proper forum, that is to say by the Registrar of Trademarks. While I also agree that whether or not the plaintiff has made an application to register the trademark \"Copperhead\" may not be entirely relevant to the passing off action, the jurisprudence is consistent that under rule 419(1)(b) through (f) it must be established that the pleading is so clearly immaterial, frivolous, embarrassing or abusive that it is obviously forlorn and futile ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). As I am not entirely satisfied that the defendants will suffer prejudice if paragraph 9 is not struck, I will allow paragraph 9 and Schedule \"A\" to remain in the Amended Statement of Claim.", "[14] The defendants further submit that the purpose of paragraph 9 is to link it to the declarations for relief that the plaintiff is seeking under paragraph 18. In other words, by virtue of paragraphs 18(b) and (c) the plaintiff is seeking declaratory relief with respect to the pending trademark application. Paragraph 18 outlines the plaintiff's prayer for relief. Paragraph 18(a) deals with a declaration pursuant to s. 7(b) of the Trade-marks Act and is not in issue. Paragraph 18(d) is a request to injunctive relief and is also not in issue. However, in paragraphs 18(b) and (c) the plaintiff claims the following: \"By reason of the activities of the defendants as aforesaid, the defendants have and will make a profit and the plaintiff, 'Copperhead', has and will suffer damage, including loss of goodwill, loss of reputation and loss of distinctiveness The Plaintiff Therefore Claims: (b) a declaration that the plaintiff as against the defendants and each of them was first to adopt a trademark and/or trade name which includes the element 'Copper' in association with the operation of a brewery business and in association with the offering for sale and sale of alcoholic brewery beverages. (c) a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to state on its application to register the trademark 'Copperhead' that the plaintiff has used the trademark in Canada in association with beer since at least as early as October 8, 1993 .\"", "[15] The declaration requested under paragraph 18(c) is not inter parties and I agree with the defendants that any application for a trademark can state any date of first use it chooses, however, it is the applicant who must establish that date to the satisfaction of the Registrar of Trademarks.", "[16] The defendants maintain that the Federal Court does not, in a passing off action, have the power to grant the relief sought in paragraphs 18(b) and (c). The defendants' position is based on the argument that pursuant to the statutory and regulatory scheme of the Trade-marks Act as it relates to trademark applications, any issues related to the plaintiff's trademark application are to be addressed at the first instance by the Registrar of Trademarks. The defendants also argue that the kind of declaration sought in paragraph 18(b) would be prejudicial to the defendants' right to apply for a trademark involving an element of \"copper\" or oppose a trademark filed by the plaintiff involving a trademark with an element of \"copper\".", "[17] In response, counsel for the plaintiff agrees that the pending application does not support a cause of action under s. 7(b) of the Trade-marks Act per se (p. 73 of the transcript) but argues that s. 7(b) gives the plaintiff the right to prevent the adoption of a confusingly similar mark, which in turn will have an impact on the plaintiff's abilities to expand its business. The plaintiff submits this court is entitled to consider the application in terms of remedies sought and the basis of those remedies. Moreover, in terms of general principles, the plaintiff argues that the mention of the application is not futile but material and relevant in the context of what is going on in the marketplace.", "[18] The plaintiff referred me to this court's decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 1 C.P.R.(3d) 214 (T.D.) and Strayer, J.'s (as he then was) comments at pp. 227, 228 and 229 that the Federal Court has jurisdiction in equity to issue a declaration as to ownership of a trademark. The relevant passages are reproduced below: \"The plaintiffs further request a declaration that Paragon 'is the owner of the trademark \"Victoriana Rose\" for use in association with china tableware'. It is to be noted that as framed the relief requested does not involve entitlement to registration. In my view, it would be open to this court to make such a declaration if it had before it all the necessary evidence. I believe that this court has jurisdiction to make such a declaration pursuant to s. 20 of the Federal Court Act which give it concurrent jurisdiction ... (Emphasis added) \"Here the Trade-marks Act in ss. 1 to 11 defines and prescribes a number of rules concerning trademarks and the adoption thereof, without reference to registration. Thereafter, the Act only deals with registered trademarks. Within the context of s. 20 of the Federal Court Act , the declaration is a remedy 'in equity' and in this case with respect to a trademark. The requirements of s. 101 of the , 1867, are also met since Parliament by ss. 1 to 11 of the Trade-marks Act has prescribed a regime concerning what constitutes a trademark and the adoption thereof, whether registered or not. \"While then it would, in my view, be legally possible to issue a declaration as to ownership of an unregistered trademark, I believe in this case I should confine myself to the evidence before me relating to the use of the trademark 'Victoriana Rose'. \"... At the same time I believe it could be useful that the use issue be clarified in this way for whatever relevance it may have to the future conduct of the parties. It may also provide assistance to the registrar should Paragon seek registration of this mark, but it does not usurp the functions of the registrar who must consider many other matters before reaching a decision as to registration.\"", "[19] Given Strayer, J.'s comments, I have no dispute with the concept that the plaintiff may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to a declaration as to ownership of the unregistered mark \"Copperhead\". However, it is also clear that such a declaration must not relate to the question of entitlement. After a closer reading of paragraph 18(b) it is my opinion that the plaintiff is seeking a declaration that he was first to adopt any trademark or trade name with the element of \"copper\" as a finding of fact, which in my view is quite a different situation than in the one before Justice Strayer in the Royal Doulton case. Further, by seeking such a declaration, the plaintiff is in effect providing the Registrar with directions from the court as to facts which the Registrar is required to find or determine at the first instance with respect to the registrability of a trademark. I agree, at this point in time, that it is not the place of this court to make such a finding or determination in a passing off action, nor would such a finding serve a useful purpose to resolve the issue of the alleged passing off between the parties. Similarly with paragraph 18(c), the question of when the plaintiff was first to use the trademark and/or trade name is a matter for the Registrar to determine at the first instance.", "[20] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of the Trade-marks Act and a motion to strike out the statement of claim on the grounds that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. Heald, J. (as he then was), found that the plaintiff had not pleaded facts that its trademark or get up was distinctive in the defendant's market or that there was likelihood of confusion in that market place. The plaintiff also asked for a declaration \"that the defendant is not entitled to seek and shall not be granted registration of the words 'Big Beef' or the word and design 'Fribble' as trademarks under the Trade-marks Act under its pending application ....\" (pp. 39-40). In terms of the declaration sought, the court made the following comment at p. 40: \"I have no difficulty whatsoever in concluding that this portion of the statement of claim must be struck out. Section 37 of the Trade-marks Act provides the way in which applications for trademarks may be opposed. Said section contains a complete code of procedure in such circumstances which has to be followed. I know of no authority which would allow the court to abridge or bypass these statutory provisions. This, in effect, is what the plaintiff is asking the court to do in para. 16(d) of the statement of claim.\"", "[21] Further, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 63, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the court was without jurisdiction to decide ownership of an invention and entitlement to apply for a patent with respect to ownership of an invention. Although the case dealt with the , I am of the view that the Court of Appeal's comments at pp. 73 and 74, regarding the court's jurisdiction under s. 20 of the Federal Court Act , apply equally to the case before me: \"The respondent's main argument was that s. 22 gives jurisdiction to the court in this matter. The main relief sought [footnote omitted], said he, is a declaration that the plaintiff, being the owner of the invention, is entitled, under the , to apply for letters patent. That relief, he added, is clearly a relief 'respecting a patent of invention' within the meaning of s. 20 and is also a relief provided for by law since the court is authorized to pronounce declaratory judgments ... \"The respondent's contention is, in my view, ill-founded. Assuming that the declaration sought in this action is a remedy respecting a patent of invention, within the meaning of s. 20, I am nevertheless of opinion that, in the circumstances of this case, it is not a relief that the Federal Court has power to grant because I agree with the appellants' view that there is no legal basis for it. Under the , the official who must first decide whether a patent may issue to an applicant is the Commissioner. The Act does not empower the courts to give him directions on the decision he should reach; it is only if he is alleged to have made a wrong decision that, under the statute, the courts may be seized of the matter. In my view, it would be contrary to the scheme of the for the courts to assume the power, in a case like the present one, to make the declaration sought. In my opinion, the power of the court under rule 1723, to make 'binding declarations of right' cannot be exercised in respect of letters patent of invention when its exercise is not expressly or impliedly contemplated by the or another statute within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament.\"", "[22] Therefore, in light of the above comments, I am of the opinion that paragraphs 18(b) and 18(c) of the Amended Statement of Claim must be struck out.", "[23] In paragraph 10 of the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiff alleges: \"Trademark and trade name searches normally performed by large beer manufacturers and sellers, such as the plaintiffs, typically consist of Nuans Trademark and Trade Name Search Reports , trademark search reports and marketplace investigations. The defendants jointly and severally are, and at all material times have been, aware of the office or principal place of business of Labatt's Ontario Breweries the address of which is 1779 Colonnade Road, South, Suite 800, Nepean, Ontario, K2E 7J4. Labatt's Ontario Breweries has been active at the above address since prior to October 8, 1993.", "[24] I must agree with the defendants' submission that the above paragraph is irrelevant to the determination of the issues in dispute in a passing off action. The plaintiff is of the view that the paragraph goes to exemplary damages and that a fair degree of latitude should be permitted with respect to facts that may establish bad faith on the part of the defendants. If, indeed, the plaintiff is making an allegation of bad faith, paragraph 10 is certainly far from clear in outlining facts to support such an allegation. I am of the view that not only is paragraph 10, as worded, irrelevant to the passing off action, it is ambiguous and should be struck out.", "[25] In paragraph 13 of the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiff claims: \"The use and advertising by the defendants, jointly and severally of 'Copper' as a trademark for beer product depreciates and erodes the value of the goodwill, reputation and distinctiveness enjoyed by the plaintiff in the 'Copperhead' trademark and trade name. Confusion has occurred and is likely to continue to occur between the respective uses and promotion by the plaintiff and defendants of 'Copperhead' and 'Copper'. The plaintiff has and will continue to lose sales. The ability of the plaintiff to expand its business as a consequence of the activities complained of in the Statement of Claim has been and will continue to be eroded and diminished. As a further consequence of the activities complained of in the Statement of Claim the value and distinctiveness of the plaintiff's 'Copperhead' trademark and trade name have and will continue to erode, diminish and depreciate.", "[26] The plaintiff further claims in paragraphs 17(c) and 17(d) that: \"By reason of the facts alleged in paragraphs 13 to 16 hereinabove, the defendants have: (c) wrongfully and unlawfully appropriated to themselves and have interfered with, eroded and diminished , the benefit of the plaintiff's reputation, goodwill and distinctiveness in the trademark and trade name 'Copperhead'; (d) depreciated, eroded, diminished and interfered with the value of the goodwill and distinctiveness attaching to the 'Copperhead' trademark and trade name.\"", "[27] Paragraph 17(d) in effect is stating a cause of action for the depreciation of the value of the goodwill in a trademark. However, it is clear that under the Trade-marks Act an unregistered trademark owner does not have such a cause of action available to him or her. Section 22(1) provides that: \"No person shall use a trademark registered by another person in a manner that is likely to have the effect of depreciating the value of the goodwill attaching thereto.\" (My emphasis added)", "[28] Therefore, a cause of action based on s. 22(1) applies only in the case of a registered trademark. In the case before me, the trademark is an unregistered one and, as such, the plaintiff has no cause of action for depreciation of goodwill. As the plaintiff 's cause of action is one of passing off, the plaintiff must therefore rely on the unfair competition section, namely s. 7, of the Trade-marks Act . Therefore, paragraph 17(d) must be struck as supporting no cause of action.", "[29] Paragraph 17(c), as I understand, is a claim of unlawful appropriation of the plaintiff's reputation, goodwill and distinctiveness in the trademark. Appropriation of reputation is dealt with as part of the plaintiff's s. 7(b) claim outlined in paragraph 17(a) of the Amended Statement of Claim. Therefore, this part of the paragraph is redundant. The next part of paragraph 17(c) speaks of eroding or interfering with the value of the goodwill and distinctiveness of the trademark. As noted by the defendants, the \"depreciation of the value of goodwill\" simply means to reduce in some way the advantage of the reputation and connection that may exist between the owners' goods and the registered mark. The result is the dilution of the distinctiveness of unique character of the trademark, per Fox, H.G., The Canadian Law of Trademarks and Unfair Competition (Carswell: Toronto, 1972) at p. 340. Once again, this is an action under s. 22 and for the reasons noted in respect of paragraph 17(d), those portions of paragraph 17(c) dealing with depreciation of goodwill and appropriation of the benefit of distinctiveness are also flawed. In terms of wrongful interference with reputation, that is dealt with by the plaintiff's claims under s. 7(b) of the Trade-marks Act , and is redundant. With respect to the claim that the defendants have wrongfully appropriated the goodwill associated with the trademark and trade name \"Copperhead\", I note the comments of Noel, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  statement of claim which claims that the defendant has 'wrongfully taken advantage of the goodwill associated with the plaintiff's trademark \"Lovable\"'. This allegation, in my view, is defective in that it gives rise to no cause of action. There indeed exists an action for infringement of a trademark or one for passing-off and I know of no other.\"", "[30] It should also be noted that Lovable involved an action for trademark infringement as there was a registered trademark at issue. Given the very similar language used by the plaintiff in the case at bar, I can only conclude the allegation that the defendants wrongfully appropriated the goodwill associated with the trademark and trade name \"Copperhead\" is also defective in that it gives rise to no cause of action. Therefore, paragraph 17(c) must be struck out.", "[31] For the reasons noted above, those portions of paragraph 13 referring to depreciation and erosion of goodwill and distinctiveness will also have to be struck out. However, in my view, the remaining portion of paragraph 13 will be better dealt with in the context of the defendants' request for particulars.", "[32] There is no dispute that at this stage of the proceedings, namely before the filing of the defence, a defendant, as noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at pp. 286-287: \"... is entitled to be furnished all particulars which will enable him to better understand the position of the plaintiff, see the basis of the case made against him and appreciate the facts on which it is founded so that he may reply intelligently to the statement of claim and state properly the grounds of defence on which he himself relies, but he is not entitled to go any further and require more than that.\"", "[33] Or as noted by counsel for the defendant: \"The purpose of particulars is to require a party to clarify the issues raised in its pleadings so that the opposite party may be able to prepare for trial, examinations for discovery and otherwise. Particulars enable the opposite party to know the case it has to meet.\"", "[34] With respect to the remaining portions of paragraph 13 dealing with confusion, which the plaintiff claims has occurred and \"is likely to continue to occur between the respective uses and promotion by the plaintiff and the defendants of 'Copperhead' and 'Copper'\"; the claim that \"the plaintiff has and will continue to lose sales\" and that the \"ability of the plaintiff to expand its business as a consequence of the activities complained of in the Statement of Claim has been and will continue to be eroded and diminished\" the defendants are entitled to know the nature of the confusion alleged, namely who was confused, where they were confused and when they were confused in order that the defendants know the nature of the case they have to meet and so that they may better plead to the Amended Statement of Claim. Similarly, with the lost sales, the defendants are entitled to information as to where the lost sales occurred. As noted by counsel for the defendants, the particulars requested should not deal with quantum of the lost sales, as that is a question left more properly for examinations for discovery. In terms of the plaintiff's ability to expand its business as a consequence of the defendants' actions, the defendants are also entitled to particulars regarding the nature of the activities related to the plaintiff's ability to expand its business, for example, not being able to increase the sales of beer. Such information will enable the defendants to better plead to the Amended Statement of Claim.", "[35] In paragraph 14 of the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiff claims: \"The defendants by virtue of their activities in association with the trademark 'Copper' for brewed alcoholic beverages have passed off and directed public attention to their wares in such a way as to be likely to cause confusion in Canada between the wares and business of the plaintiff and the wares and business of the defendants at the time the defendants commenced so to direct attention to their wares in association with 'Copper'. The defendants are liable to the plaintiff for all such unlawful activities.\"", "[36] Basically, the plaintiff is pleading confusion between the plaintiff's wares and business and the wares and business of the defendants.", "[37] The defendants seek particulars with respect to where the confusion has occurred, in that pursuant to s. 7(b) the plaintiff's scope of protection is limited to where it has established its reputation. The plaintiff responds that the activities in question have occurred throughout Canada and that the Amended Statement of Claim contains sufficient detail to enable the defendants to plead to the allegations contained therein. The plaintiff is also of the view that the particulars sought with respect to paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 constitute requests for evidence rather than particulars.", "[38] In terms of the confusion alleged in paragraph 14, counsel for the defendants indicated at the hearing of the motion that \"... arguably we're entitled to more particulars than that, but we're not going to take issue with that. We'll just get on with the matter\" (p. 42 of the transcript). In light of this comment, I will refrain from making any order regarding the defendants' request for particulars with respect to the allegation of confusion in paragraph 14.", "[39] As I understand, the defendants are also seeking particulars with respect to the passing off allegations outlined in paragraphs 14 and 15, specifically that the defendants have substituted their wares for that of the plaintiff's when the consumer has asked for the plaintiff's wares.", "[40] Paragraph 15 of the Amended Statement of Claim reads as follows: \"The defendants, by marketing, advertising, offering for sale and selling brewed alcoholic beverages in association with the trademark 'Copper' and/or enabling, inducing or procuring each other and/or others to do so, are directing public attention to their wares in such a manner as to cause, or be likely to cause, confusion in Canada between the wares and business of the plaintiff, 'Copperhead', and the wares of the defendants, contrary to the provisions of s. 7(b) of the Trade-marks Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, and are passing off their wares as and for those ordered or requested, contrary to the provisions of s. 7(c) of the Trade-marks Act (supra).\"", "[41] I am satisfied that the defendants are clearly entitled to particulars with respect to the passing off action. As noted by Richard, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  off is pleaded, the plaintiff must indicate some of the places, times and persons to whom the defendant is allegedly to have wrongfully passed-off its goods.\" Moreover, I am of the view that paragraphs 14 and 15 do not provide sufficient facts to enable the defendants to properly respond to the allegations outlined in the Amended Statement of Claim. As such, the defendants are entitled to particulars regarding where, when and to whom the passing off occurred.", "[42] For the reasons noted above, the defendants' motion to strike certain paragraphs of the Amended Statement of Claim is granted on the following terms: (1) paragraphs 10, 17(c), 17(d), 18(b), 18(c) and the relevant parts of paragraph 13 are to be struck out; (2) the plaintiff is granted 60 days from the date of this order within which to file and serve on the defendants its further Amended Statement of Claim;", "[43] For the reasons noted above, the defendants' motion for particulars is granted on the following terms: (1) with respect to paragraph 13 of the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiff shall furnish particulars, in writing, as to the confusion referred to in the second sentence of paragraph 13, the lost sales referred to in the third sentence of paragraph 13 and the allegation that the plaintiff has been and will be prevented from expanding its business as referred to in the fourth sentence of paragraph 13; (2) the plaintiff shall furnish full and complete particulars, in writing, as to the passing off referred to in each of paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Amended Statement of Claim.", "[44] The plaintiff is given 60 days from the date of this order to furnish to the defendants the above noted particulars.", "[45] The defendants shall have 30 days within which to file their Statement of Defence from the date of service by the plaintiff of a further Amended Statement of Claim and/or particulars.", "[46] The costs of the defendants' application to strike certain paragraphs of the Amended Statement of Claim and in the alternative, for particulars shall be in the cause.

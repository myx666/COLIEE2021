{"id_": "001263", "body_str": ["[1] Tremblay-Lamer, J. : The applicants seek judicial review of a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division [\"Board\"] dated August 21, 1995 which determined that the applicants were not Convention refugees.", "[2] The male applicant, Salah Mohamed Ali, the female applicant, Somia Elamin, and one of their young children, Mohamed Salah Ali, are citizens of Sudan. Their younger child, Musaab Salah Ali is a citizen of the United States.", "[3] Relying on the male applicant's claim, all applicants claim to be Convention refugees on the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution because of their political opinion and membership in a particular social group, the family. The male applicant was active in the Democratic Unionist Party [\"DUP\"] while attending high school and university, during a time when all political parties were banned. Due to his political activities, he was detained on three separate occasions for periods of 48 hours, seven days and two weeks. He then left the country with his family to go to Syria but returned to Sudan as they ran out of money and wanted to apply for Canadian visas. The male applicant remained in Sudan between August 11, 1991 and October 10, 1991. On that date, he left for the United States as he had been granted a visitor's visa. His family joined him two years later. The applicants came to Canada on May 14, 1994. The Board's Decision", "[4] The Board found that the male applicant's fear of persecution was not objectively well-founded. One reason was because, on his return from Syria, he voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the Sudanese government. The Board was not persuaded that the applicant was compelled to do so because he was short of funds and because he was refused a U.S. visa; the applicant did not then attempt to obtain a visa from any other country. The Board stated that \"if he had good grounds for fearing persecution he would not have returned to Sudan\". The Board noted that between the time the male applicant's return from Syria and his departure to the U.S., he did not participate in political activities against the authorities, nor was he approached to join the Popular Defence Forces. The Board noted that on October 11, 1991 the applicant left Sudan on a genuine passport without encountering problems at the airport.", "[5] The Board stated: \"The panel is of the opinion that after the male claimant was released from detention in July 1991, the authorities were not interested in him because of his political activities, nor were they interested in recruiting him in the popular defence forces. The panel concludes that his experiences with the authorities prior to July 1991, because of his involvement in the DUP or his other political activities, does not give rise to a well founded fear of persecution should he return to Sudan today.\"", "[6] The Board doubted the male applicant's assertion that his political activities in the United States had come to the attention of Sudanese authorities and, in fact, the Board made an adverse credibility finding regarding the applicant's participation in these activities. The Board also did not believe the applicant's testimony regarding the searches of his father's house subsequent to the applicants' departure. The Board found: \"The male claimant alleged that he openly participated in political activities against the Sudanese government in the U.S. The panel notes that when he arrived in the U.S. in October, 1991, he was granted permission to remain in the country for two months. The panel also notes that he did not seek a further extension of his visa, nor did he apply for Convention refugee status there. It appears, from the evidence, that throughout his stay in the U.S. he resided and worked illegally. The panel finds it implausible that someone in his situation would take a risk of being apprehended and deported by the U.S. authorities by openly taking part in political activities. \"The panel also notes that the male claimant was released from detention by the Sudanese authorities in July 1991 upon signing a statement undertaking that he would not take part in political activities in the future. He did not take part in these activities during his stay in Sudan from August 1991 to October 10, 1991. Nor is there any indication that since arriving in Canada in May 1994, he had been involved in the DUP or any other political activities against the Sudanese government. The panel finds his testimony to be implausible. \"The male claimant alleged that the security forces went to his father's house in Sudan on two occasions to search for documents pertaining to him (the male claimant). He did not know when the security forces visited his father's house on the first occasion. He was able to explain, with hesitation, that they went on the second occasion three months prior to the hearing on December 23, 1994. The panel does not find his testimony to be plausible. \"On a balance of probabilities, the panel does not believe that during his stay in the U.S., the male claimant was involved in the activities of the DUP or the Sudan Democratic National Alliance or that his involvement in these organizations has come to the attention of the Sudanese authorities. The panel assigns no probative value to the letter issued by the DUP in the U.S. The panel believes that he concocted this part of the story to establish that he is a refugee 'sur place'.\"", "[7] The Board questioned the fear of persecution professed by the male applicant because of his delay in making a refugee claim. The Board cited <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), for the proposition that delay in making a claim is an important factor in assessing the actions and conduct of the claimant. In this regard, the Board drew an adverse inference from the fact that the male applicant remained in the U.S. for close to three years without seeking the protection of that country, particularly since for all but two months, the applicant lived and worked illegally in the U.S. and was therefore in danger of being caught and returned to Sudan by U.S. authorities. The Board believed \"that had he been afraid of being persecuted by the Sudanese authorities he would have sought asylum there\". The Board cited <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), for the proposition that the CRDD may assume that a country adhering to an international convention (as the U.S. is a signatory to the 1967 U.N. Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees) will meet its obligation to implement the Convention within its territory unless evidence to the contrary is introduced. The Board stated that \"The panel does not have sufficient evidence before it to show that the U.S. authorities do not meet their obligation to implement the Protocol within their territory. The panel finds his behaviour and actions to be inconsistent with a person claiming to have a fear of persecution.\"", "[8] The Board found the male applicant to be an economic migrant, and not a Convention refugee. The Board noted that he was working illegally in the U.S. at the same time the female applicant stated that she could not immediately leave Sudan despite alleged difficulties with authorities because her husband did not have a job in the U.S. The Board stated, \"there is no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which to base a positive determination\".", "[9] The Board found the female applicant's testimony regarding her alleged problems with the authorities following her husband's departure not to be credible, as these problems were not on her PIF. The Board was not satisfied with her explanation for the discrepancy, stating: \"she provided the new information in her oral testimony to bolster her claim\".", "[10] As with the male applicant, the Board doubted the female applicant's fear of persecution in Sudan because she did not make a claim for asylum in the U.S. although she lived there illegally for one and a half years. As well, the Board considered that the female applicant had returned to Sudan from Syria. Given that the Board did not accept the male applicant's refugee claim, the Board could not accept that the female applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution in Sudan as her claim was based on her husband's claim. Similarly, the Board found that the minor applicants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Sudan. Further, the Board noted that the minor applicant who is a joint Sudan/U.S. citizen did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in the U.S.", "[11] Therefore, the Board concluded that the applicants were not Convention refugees. Analysis", "[12] The applicants submit that the Board misapprehended the evidence, both specific to the male applicant and regarding conditions in Sudan. They argue that there was documentary evidence before the Board relating to \"similarly situated individuals\" who were arrested, detained and tortured by the Sudanese authorities. I do not believe the Board committed any error in not examining this documentation since it found it implausible that the applicant was in fact involved in political activities after his release from detention. Since the Board believed he was no longer participating in political activities, it was not necessary to examine the documentation pertaining to political activists.", "[13] As to the applicants' return to Sudan, the applicants cite Goodwin-Gill's definition of \"re-availment\" as \"an establishment of normal relations with the authorities of the country of origin\" and state that this does not include return with the intention of leaving again. It is conceded by the respondent that the applicants' situation does not meet the definition. The applicants cite <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  returned to his country of origin, it was not considered that he re-availed himself of state protection. However, that case can be distinguished on the basis that, in that case, the applicant had returned to Sri Lanka to care for his ill mother. In the case at bar, there was no such pressing reason for the applicants to return to Sudan rather than to investigate visa possibilities at other consulates in Syria. A more analogous case is <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), a case in which the applicant returned from the U.K. to Turkey twice for short periods of time before making a claim in Canada. Rothstein, J., upheld the Board's finding that the applicant's returns to Turkey reflected negatively on the veracity of his alleged fears. Leaving aside the technical definition of \"re-availment of state protection\", it would seem that concluding that the applicants would not have returned to Sudan if they had had a well-founded fear of persecution is an inference that was reasonably open to the Board. The conduct of the applicants was inconsistent with the alleged well-founded fear of persecution.", "[14] The applicants state that in concluding that they were able to return to Sudan from Syria without encountering any problems with the authorities, the Board ignored the male applicant's evidence that he had the assistance of a friend to bypass procedures at the airport. Although it may be true that the Board overlooked this fact, this alone cannot form a basis for allowing the application for judicial review as it was not central to it's decision and does not change the fact that he voluntary returned to Sudan. The applicants make a similar argument regarding the Board's conclusion that the male applicant was able to obtain a U.S. visitor's visa without difficulties with the Sudanese authorities; however, this conclusion is in fact supported in the male applicant's evidence that on September 19, 1991 he was granted an exit permit by the Sudanese authorities.", "[15] As to the Board's credibility finding about the male applicant's political activities in the United States, the applicants' main argument seems to be that the Board provided no explanation for assigning \"no probative value\" to a letter issued by the DUP in the U.S. regarding the male applicant's political activities. Considering the Board's finding that it was implausible that the male applicant would continue high profile activities against the government of Sudan while living illegally in the U.S. and while his wife was still in Sudan, the Board was entitled to give no weight to that letter. The fact that he is a member of the DUP does not indicate that he has high profile activities against the government.", "[16] Regarding the applicants' delay in making his claim in the United States, the applicants submit that the board erred in law and made an adverse finding of credibility on the basis of no evidence. The conclusion that \"had he been afraid of being persecuted by Sudanese authorities (sic) he would have sought asylum there\" goes to the heart of the claim and was based on an incorrect assumption that not having made a claim for refugee status he would be deported to Sudan if apprehended. In fact, U.S. law provides for a person making a refugee claim after apprehension.", "[17] As stated by the Board and by the respondent, the cases of Heer , supra, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, Bogus , supra, and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  into account delay in making a claim to refugee status. As submitted by the respondent, notwithstanding U.S. immigration law, it was open for the Board to make an inference about the applicant's state of mind from the fact that he did not make a refugee claim in the U.S. The U.S. law in question was not before the Board, and it is not necessarily the case that the applicants knew of, and considered this law at the relevant times. The inference that a person with a well-founded fear of persecution would have made a refugee claim at an earlier time once in the U.S. was reasonably open to the Board to draw.", "[18] Although I recognize that the Board may have committed some minor errors, I cannot conclude, in the light of the high standard of review applicable, that the errors warrant the intervention of this court.", "[19] Accordingly, the application for judicial review is dismissed.", "[20] The applicants have requested that I certify the following question: \"What connection to the State must be reestablished before a return to one's country of nationality can be said to constitute re-availment of protection?\"", "[21] In the case at bar, this was not the essential issue to be decided. I will therefore not certify the question. Application dismissed. Editor: Angela E. McKay/kaw [End of document]"]}

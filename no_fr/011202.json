{"id_": "011202", "body_str": ["[1] O'Reilly, J. : In 2009, the warden at Ferndale Institution rejected Mr Michael Spidel's nomination to serve on the inmate committee. The issue ultimately made its way to this Court by way of judicial review. Justice Anne Mactavish concluded that Mr Spidel had been treated unfairly and that the warden's decision had been unreasonable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).", "[2] Mr Spidel subsequently submitted another grievance in which he identified several errors in the Commissioner's Directive relating to Inmate Committees [CD 083]. His main concern is that CD 083 does not accord with Justice Mactavish's decision. He filed this latest grievance at the final, third-level of the Offender Grievance Procedure based on his view that issues relating to the content of Commissioner's Directives should be brought directly to the Commissioner himself. A delegate of the Commissioner, a Senior Deputy Commissioner [SDC], concluded that Mr Spidel's grievance essentially raised matters of general policy that fell outside the ambit of the grievance process. The SDC therefore rejected Mr Spidel's grievance and suggested that he bring the matter before an inmate committee, where members can make recommendations relating to matters affecting the inmate population as a whole.", "[3] Mr Spidel argues that the SDC erred in concluding that his complaint fell outside the grievance procedure and that it should have been brought to an inmate committee. He asks me to quash the SDC's decision and refer the matter back for reconsideration.", "[4] I can find no basis for overturning the SDC's decision and must, therefore, dismiss this application for judicial review.", "[5] The issue is whether the SDC erred in law. II. The Legal Framework (1) The Grievance Process", "[6] Offenders are entitled to a fair and expeditious process for resolving grievances that fall within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Corrections ( Corrections and Conditional Release Act , SC 1992, c 20, s 90 [CCRA]; provisions cited are set out in an Annex).", "[7] The Offender Grievance Procedure is set out in the Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations , SOR/92-620 [CCRR]. It includes the following steps: • an offender who is dissatisfied with an action or decision of a staff member may make a written complaint to the staff member's supervisor (s 74(1)); • the offender and staff must try to resolve the matter informally (s 74(2)); • the supervisor must review the complaint and provide the offender with a copy of his or her decision as soon as practicable (s 74(3)); • if the offender is not satisfied with the decision, the offender may submit a grievance to the institutional head (s 75( )); • the institutional head must review the grievance to determine whether it falls within the jurisdiction of the Correctional Service of Canada [CSC] (s 76(1)); • if the grievance does not fall within the CSC's jurisdiction, the institutional head must advise the offender in writing and inform the offender of any other available remedy (s 76(2)); • the institutional head must give the offender a copy of his or her decision as soon as practicable (s 78); • if the offender is not satisfied with the decision, the offender can appeal to the head of the region (s 80(1)); • the offender can appeal the decision of the regional head to the Commissioner (s 80(2)); • the offender must be provided a copy of the regional head's decision and the Commissioner's decision as soon as practicable (s 80(3)).", "[8] Further details of the process are contained in Commissioner's Directive 081 - Offender Complaints and Grievances [CD 081]. It makes clear that offenders should begin the process with a complaint to the supervisor of the staff member involved, unless the supervisor is the Institutional Head, the Regional Deputy Commissioner, or the Commissioner himself (s 13). In any case, the decision of the Commissioner represents the final stage of the grievance process (s 15). CD 081 also sets out the time frames within which decision makers at the various levels must respond, depending on the priority of the complaint (s 18).", "[9] Additional details can be found in Commissioner's Directive 081-1 - Offender Complaint and Grievance Process [CD 081-1]. It describes the four-level process set out above. It confirms that the final decision-maker is the Commissioner (s 7). Sometimes, inmates can file a complaint above the initial level. For example, a complaint about inter-regional transfers, or a transfer to or from the Special Handling Unit must go directly to the third level. The other exceptions, mentioned above, arise when the complaint relates to the conduct of a senior staff member; eg , a complaint about an institutional head should be made at the second level to the regional head.", "[10] CD-081-1 lists some matters that cannot be grieved. For example, matters relating to access to information or privacy must be made to the Information Commissioner or the Privacy Commissioner, as the case may be. Mr Spidel points out that CD-081-1 does not state explicitly that complaints about Commissioner's Directives cannot be grieved. (2) Inmate Committees", "[11] Offenders are entitled to an opportunity to contribute to decisions of the CSC that affect the inmate population as a whole, except security matters (CCRA, s 74).", "[12] Particulars relating to inmate committees are set out in Commissioner's Directive 083, the document Mr Spidel argues contains numerous errors. However, it is clear that CD 083 provides that inmate committees may make recommendations to the institutional head in relation to decisions affecting the inmate population (s 10). III. Did the SDC err in law?", "[13] Mr Spidel argues that the SDC erred in concluding that his grievance did not fall within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and that he should have presented his concerns about CD 083 to an inmate committee. Obviously, he says, the content of a Commissioner's Directive is within the Commissioner's jurisdiction.", "[14] In particular, he maintains that his complaint falls within the grievance procedure because he is \"an offender who is dissatisfied with an action or decision of a staff member\" (CCRR, s 74(1)). The \"action or decision\" is CD 083; the \"staff member\" is the Commissioner of Corrections.", "[15] I cannot agree with Mr Spidel's submissions.", "[16] It is possible that the issue of a Commissioner's Directive is an \"action or decision\" of the Commissioner. But it is clear to me that a complaint about the content of a Commissioner's Directive does not fall within the Offender Grievance Procedure.", "[17] Complaints can be made about the conduct of a \"staff member\". Is the Commissioner a staff member in this context? In my view, he is not.", "[18] The procedure provides that inmates should commence the grievance process by filing a complaint with the staff member's supervisor. It is not clear who the Commissioner's supervisor would be. The next steps would involve an institutional head and a regional head. It seems unlikely that a decision of the Commissioner's supervisor, whoever that might be, would be reviewed by officials subordinate to the Commissioner himself. Further, the final step would involve review by the Commissioner, bringing the matter full circle back to the person about whose conduct the offender is complaining in the first place. It is unlikely that this process accommodates complaints about the Commissioner, given that it creates a closed loop with the Commissioner himself having the final word about the disposition of the complaint.", "[19] Accordingly, I cannot conclude that the SDC erred in finding that Mr Spidel's grievance did not fall within the Offender Grievance Procedure. If the intention had been to allow inmates to grieve Commissioner's Directives, it is likely that CD-081-1, which sets out circumstances where inmates can bring complaints directly to the third-level, would so provide.", "[20] As far as the alternative remedy suggested by the SDC, it is clear that inmate committees can make recommendations about matters involving the inmate population as a whole. Therefore, the SDC did not err in referring to that potential alternative remedy. Her decision was consistent with the obligation to inform the offender of another available remedy when a grievance is beyond the jurisdiction of the CSC (CCRR, s 76(2)). IV. Conclusion and Disposition", "[21] The SDC did not err in concluding that Mr Spidel's grievance fell outside the jurisdiction of the Offender Grievance Procedure and should have been raised with his inmate committee. Accordingly, I must dismiss this application for judicial review. As Mr Spidel raised a matter of general public interest, there is no order as to costs. JUDGMENT", "[22] THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that: 1. The application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no order as to costs. Application dismissed.

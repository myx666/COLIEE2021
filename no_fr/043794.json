{"id_": "043794", "body_str": ["[1] Boivin, J. [Translation]: This is an application for judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act ), against a decision dated March 29, 2009, by an immigration officer (the officer), refusing the applicants' application for permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations (H&C application) under subsection 25(1) of the Act Issue", "[2] The only issue here is whether the immigration officer erred in fact and in law in rejecting the applicants' H&C application and concluding that they would not face unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship if they had to file their application for permanent residence from Pakistan. Factual background", "[3] The 59-year-old male applicant, Nisar Ahmed, and his spouse, the 53-year-old female applicant, Yasmeen Ahmed, have experienced family problems since the death of Mr. Ahmed's father in 1970. The applicants attributed problems at that time to Hafeez Ahmed, Mr. Ahmed's brother, who opposed the applicants' marriage in 1972. The applicants married nonetheless and left Pakistan for Kuwait. Mr. Ahmed left in 1973, and Mrs. Ahmed in 1975. Mr. Ahmed adds that, around 1996, Hafeez wanted to arrange forced marriages between his own children and those of the applicants. Hafeez allegedly even threatened them over the telephone after their arrival in Canada. Mr. Ahmed states that he is also worried for his children's safety.", "[4] The applicants lived in Kuwait until 1988 (or 1992 according to the information) and moved to the United States. They did not seek asylum in the United States.", "[5] The applicants made a claim for refugee protection in Canada on March 1, 2003, with their son Numan Ahmed Shaikh and daughter Iram Nisar Shaikh. The children are not included in this application: Numan was sponsored by his wife, and his application is pending, whereas Iram has been a permanent resident in Canada since November 22, 2007. The officer nevertheless considered the two children's presence in Canada in his analysis. The applicants also have a son in the United States.", "[6] On October 23, 2003, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the applicants' claim for refugee protection. On February 2, 2004, the Federal Court dismissed the application for leave and for judicial review of the RPD's decision.", "[7] On September 1, 2006, the applicants submitted a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) application.", "[8] On December 11, 2006, the applicants submitted their H&C application.", "[9] On March 31, 2009, the officer rejected the applicants' PRRA and H&C applications.", "[10] On May 25, 2009, the applicants filed an application for leave and for judicial review against the officer's decision on humanitarian and compassionate considerations. Impugned decision", "[11] In the immigration officer's opinion, the applicants would not face unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if they were to file their application for permanent residence in Pakistan.", "[12] The applicants' claim for refugee protection was rejected in October 2003, but they nevertheless decided to remain in Canada without status. The officer notes that the applicants did not stay in Canada because of circumstances beyond their control, since they both had valid passports when their application was rejected.", "[13] The officer concluded that the applicants were well established in Canada. The notices of assessment submitted show that Mr. Ahmed has successfully integrated into the workforce and that Mrs. Ahmed has held various jobs since 2006. The officer notes that the applicants are able to support themselves without relying on government assistance. As the applicants spent 15 years in the United States and 6 in Canada, the officer acknowledges that both are fluent in English, one of the two official languages in Canada.", "[14] The officer recognizes that the applicants have volunteered or participated in community activities, but their involvement with various organizations does not establish that they would face unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship were they to file their application from outside of Canada.", "[15] In the officer's view, that the applicants lived for 10 to 15 years in the United States and 15 to 20 years in Kuwait cannot be considered to be a humanitarian and compassionate ground characterizing their integration in Canada. Even though the applicants lived most of their lives outside of Pakistan, it is nevertheless their country of citizenship, and they have rights and obligations associated with that country.", "[16] The officer recognizes that the applicants are seeking to reunite their family, as they have a daughter who is a permanent resident in Canada and a son who is likely to become one soon. These two children had claimed refugee protection with their parents in 2003. However, the purpose of a request for an exemption in an H&C application is to establish whether the applicants would face unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship were they to return to Pakistan to file an application. Refusing the application would separate the applicants from their children, but the officer notes that the children could sponsor the applicants under section 116 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations , SOR/2002-227 (the Regulations ).", "[17] The applicants lived for a number of years abroad without obtaining legal status, be it in Kuwait or the United States. Their immigration file reveals that they want to settle in Canada for economic reasons, and, in the officer's opinion, they have the option of filing an application for permanent residence from abroad to join their family members in Canada or elsewhere.", "[18] The immigration officer also considered Khan Aayan Ahmed, the applicants' grandson, who was born in the United States in 2007, since the best interests of the child must be taken into account under subsection 25(1) of the Act . The child's best interests do not outweigh the other factors related to the case, but they must be given particular attention ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The officer recognizes that refusing the exemption would separate the grandparents from their grandson, but the applicants have not established that such a separation would cause them or their grandson unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. Given Khan's young age, the officer is of the view that the effects on him are not determinative at this time.", "[19] The officer also recognizes the presence of many other members of the applicants' family in Canada. While these family ties are not in issue, these are interested parties, and the officer attaches more weight to the presence of brothers and sisters in Pakistan than to that of cousins in Canada. The officer also notes that the applicants' immediate family members in Pakistan will be able to support them temporarily on their return.", "[20] Despite the family problems alleged in their Personal Information Form (PIF), the applicants did not seek asylum in the United States, even though they stayed there for over 10 years and allege that the problems date back to 1970. The officer is of the opinion that such behaviour is inconsistent with that of persons fearing for their lives or safety. The applicants had more than 10 years to legalize their status in the United States but did not do so. The officer attaches no weight to family members' affidavits reiterating that the applicants were forced to flee Pakistan for their lives in the 1970s. The officer gave considerable weight to the RPD's determination that the claim for refugee protection was not credible because of omissions noted between the port of entry notes and the PIF.", "[21] The officer acknowledged the numerous problems in Pakistan, referring to the documentary evidence, in particular the U.S. Department of State's 2008 report and information from BBC News. The officer noted that recent events involving the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in a suicide attack on December 27, 2007, and President Musharraf's resignation in August 2008 cannot be ignored when analyzing the current situation in Pakistan. However, in the immigration agent's opinion, the entire population of Pakistan is affected by these events, and they are not an objectively identifiable personalized risk for the applicants' lives or safety.", "[22] In the officer's view, the applicants did not establish that these are problems that are personal to them. The alleged risks to their children are no longer valid, since the children are already established in Canada or the United States. Despite positive elements, there are insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to approve this request for an exemption under subsection 25(1) of the Act Relevant legislation", "[23] The relevant provisions are set out in Schedule A at the end of this document. Standard of review", "[24] The standard of review of a decision made under subsection 25(1) of the Act on the basis of humanitarian and compassionate considerations is reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 15-20; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 31).", "[25] The assessment of the reasonableness of a decision is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. The decision must fall within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 47).", "[26] The applicants submit that the officer's decision is wrong in law because it is inconsistent with the May 12, 2008, Operational Manual on immigrant applications in Canada made on humanitarian or compassionate grounds. In particular, the officer failed to follow sections 11.1, 11.2, 12.1, 12.2 and 12.4 of the Operational Manual and thereby made an unreasonable decision. The officer did not take into consideration the applicants' degree of establishment and family reunification, and improperly assessed the risk factor.", "[27] The H&C decision-making process is a highly discretionary one that considers whether a special grant of an exemption is warranted ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 6). The respondent notes that the hardship that is inherent in having to leave Canada is not enough ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para. 10).", "[28] The respondent submits that the officer was right to attach only relative weight to these two factors, as case law reveals that this Court has repeatedly refused to intervene when the issue is actually the weight assigned to various factors by an immigration officer ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Analysis", "[29] It is well established that those who wish to obtain status as a permanent resident in Canada must apply for such status from outside of Canada. However, subsection 25(1) of the Act states that the Minister has the discretion to exempt a foreign national from any criterion or obligation provided for in the Act and grant the foreign national permanent resident status if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national.", "[30] Here, the immigration officer considered all of the evidence on the record, and the reasons given by the officer are justified and understandable. It was open to the officer to conclude that there is insufficient evidence on file to show that the applicants would face unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship if they had to submit their application for permanent residence from outside of Canada. It should be noted that, in order to succeed, the onus is on applicants submitting H&C applications to establish that they satisfy the conditions ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).", "[31] It is not for the Court to reweigh the evidence before the immigration officer. Counsel for the applicants relied on their relationship with family members in Canada. In his decision, the officer considered family reunification and even suggested that the applicants' children could sponsor their parents. The officer took into account the best interests of the applicants' children and grandson. It was also open to the officer to prefer certain documentary evidence to other sources in his analysis of current problems in Pakistan. Furthermore, in the Court's opinion, the officer reasonably concluded that the applicants' behaviour in not seeking protection during their 10-year stay in the United States is inconsistent with that of persons fearing for their lives and safety.", "[32] Even though the evidence shows that the applicants are quite well established, it was open to the officer to examine establishment as but one factor among others to consider in the H&C application ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Moreover, it is settled law that the degree of establishment in and of itself is not determinative of an H&C application ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This is also true in the case of family reunification ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> v Canada (M.C.I.) , 2006 FC 1474, Manjit Singh Canada (M.C.I.) , 2009 FC 11, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).", "[33] Even though the applicants have been in Canada for six (6) years, the Court notes that the record does not establish that their presence in Canada is related to circumstances beyond their control. By staying in Canada, the applicants made a decision, the consequences of which they must now face, and the Court is of the opinion that they cannot be rewarded for having accumulated time in Canada ( Manjit Singh ).", "[34] In this case, counsel for the applicants essentially argued that the officer should have assigned more weight to one element than to another. On reading the immigration officer's decision, the Court is of the view that the officer analyzed the evidence and weighed all of the relevant factors as a whole. In that sense, the Court adopts Justice Martineau's comments in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 7: \"The weight to be attached or assigned to particular factors or indicators of attachment is discretionary. On a standard of reasonableness, a reviewing court must examine the evidence to determine whether any reasons support the impugned decision. Therefore, it is not our role to re-examine the weight given to the different H&C factors by the Immigration Officer.\"", "[35] At the hearing, counsel for the applicants contended that, contrary to the respondent's submissions, the applicants had indeed claimed asylum in the United States. However, the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated September 2, 2003, that put in issue the applicants' credibility indicates that the applicants had in fact taken steps but only upon being notified of their removal: \"The claimant's lack of credibility is also reinforced by his failure to claim refugee status in the U.S. The claimant testified that he and his family stayed in the U.S. illegally, alleging a fear of return to Pakistan. Yet, they only requested a hearing at the U.S. Immigration Court when they were served with a notice to appear for removal proceedings on February 5, 2003.\"", "[36] The immigration officer's conclusion that the applicants' situation did not allow him to grant them an exemption from the requirement of having to submit an application for permanent residence from outside of Canada was justified and intelligible, and falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes.", "[37] The parties did not propose a question for certification, and no question arises on this record. JUDGMENT", "[38] THE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that the application for judicial review be dismissed. No question is certified. Application dismissed. Editor: E. Joanne Oley/pdk Schedule A - Relevant Legislation Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001, c. 27: Humanitarian and compassionate considerations 25(1) The Minister shall, upon request of a foreign national in Canada who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on the Minister's own initiative or on request of a foreign national outside Canada, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligation of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to them, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected, or by public policy considerations. 12(1) A foreign national may be selected as a member of the family class on the basis of their relationship as the spouse, common-law partner, child, parent or other prescribed family member of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. 13(1) A Canadian citizen or permanent resident may, subject to the regulations, sponsor a foreign national who is a member of the family class.

Withdrawal of sponsorship application 119. A decision shall not be made on an application for a permanent resident visa by a member of the family class if the sponsor withdraws their sponsorship application in respect of that member. Approved sponsorship application 120.

IP 5 Operational Manual - Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds 11.1. Procedural fairness Officers must follow procedural fairness in making their decisions. Officers should: • carefully consider all the information before them; • inform the applicant when considering extrinsic information, giving the applicant a chance to respond; • request any additional information needed; • weigh all the facts according to their degree of importance; • separate facts which favour a finding of hardship from those that do not; and • consider the objectives of the Act. Officers may discuss cases with their colleagues and supervisor to share ideas. However, officers must make their own decisions based on the facts before them. More information is available in Appendix A - Administrative law principles. 11.2. Prolonged stay or inability to leave has led to establishment There is no hard and fast rule relating to the period of time in Canada but it is expected that a significant degree of establishment would take several years to achieve. Officers should consider the following factors: • Are the circumstances that led to the applicant remaining in Canada of significant duration and beyond their control? • Is there a significant degree of establishment in Canada (see Section 11.3 below)? • Is, or was, the applicant the subject of a temporary suspension of removal (TSR)? • To what degree has the applicant cooperated with the Department, particularly with regard to travel documents? • Did the applicant wilfully lose or destroy travel documents? (Where no valid travel or identity document has been provided, contact the local Removals Unit to determine whether this is due to an applicant's unwillingness to complete a passport application.) Also refer to Section 5.16 for relevant information on this topic. 12.1. Factors to consider regarding the applicant and their relatives For applicants with family relationships, the following factors should also be considered: • whether the applicant could have been a member of the family class had they applied outside Canada; and • whether a sponsorship was submitted and approved. If so, this is a factor among all of the others that may be considered favourable. Still, lack of a sponsorship does not mean that the exemption request should be refused (see Section 12.2 below). Factors related to country of origin • an applicant's links with their country of origin (e.g. the amount of time they resided in their country of origin, their ability to speak the language, return visits since their arrival in Canada and family members remaining in the country of origin); and • family members' link(s) to the applicant's country of origin, if applicable (e.g. the amount of time spent in applicant's country of origin, their ability to speak language of the applicant's country of origin, other family members in the applicant's country of origin). Factors related to current immigration or citizenship status • the current immigration or citizenship status of each member of the family; • the applicant's immigration status at the time the family links were formed (i.e. status at the time of marriage, of having children, etc.); and • if applicant's immigration status was lost after the family links were formed, what was the original status and under what circumstances was the status lost. Factors related to links with family members • the effective links with family members (children, spouse, parents, siblings, etc.) in terms of an ongoing relationship as opposed to a simple biological fact of relationship; • an applicant's place of residence in relation to the family members, particularly their children; • any previous period of separation (what was the duration and the reason?); • court order in relation to custody arrangements, if applicable; • if applicant is the non-custodial parent, have they been exercising their visitation rights; • information indicated in the family court documents about the family's circumstances; • the degree of psychological/emotional support in relation to other family members; • whether the family will have the option of being together in another country or be able to maintain contact; and • the impact on family members, especially children, if the applicant is removed. 12.2. No sponsorship included in the application Where an H&C application based on reunification of relatives or applicants with family relationships is not supported by a sponsorship, officers should: • give the applicant an opportunity to have the sponsorship forms completed or to explain why there is no sponsorship; and • make the Stage 1 assessment when all the relevant facts are available. In these cases, officer should consider: • the reason for the lack of sponsorship (ensuring that it is not due to lack of information or an oversight on the part of the prospective sponsor). Lack of sponsorship usually falls into one of the three following categories: ◆ sponsor unwilling to submit sponsorship; ◆ sponsor self-screened out due to ineligibility; and ◆ sponsorship submitted but refused due to ineligibility of the sponsor. • whether the reason for lack of sponsorship impacts on any H&C aspects of the application. Principal applicant is a child yet no sponsorship was included In addition to the factors outlined above, officers should consider: • proof of relationship; • the best interest of the child (see Section 5.14); and • how custody agreements or court decisions, if any, affect the H&C application. 12.4. Sponsorship of children Officers should consider the following factors when the principal applicant is a minor being sponsored: • proof of relationship to the sponsor; • the best interest of the child; and • how custody agreements or court decisions, if any, affect the H&C application.

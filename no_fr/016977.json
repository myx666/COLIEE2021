{"id_": "016977", "body_str": ["[1] Joyal, J. : This is an application to review and set aside a decision of an Immigration Officer refusing to recommend that the applicant and his family be allowed to have their landing applications processed while remaining in Canada. The Immigration Officer found that there were insufficient humanitarian or compassionate grounds to do otherwise.", "[2] Sound arguments are raised by able counsel for the applicants in support of their case. After all is said and done, however, the main thrust of his position centres on the doctrine of fairness in the process through which the Immigration Officer reached his negative decision.", "[3] As a basis for this, counsel for the applicant had available to him the following material: 1. The Immigration file on the applicants. 2. The Refugee Board decision of October 23, 1991, denying the applicants' claim for refugee status as well as the Federal Court decision denying the applicants' leave to challenge the Refugee Board's decision. 3. An 11-page brief by applicant's counsel dated November 10, 1992, setting out the grounds for humanitarian and compassionate consideration. 4. The Immigration Officer's notes on a lengthy interview held with the applicants and their counsel on August 6, 1993. 5. Notes on a meeting with applicants' counsel on September 1, 1993. 6. A further brief by applicants' counsel date on September 2, 1993, arguing that the Refugee Board's refusal to grant the applicants refugee status \"was not a reflection of the sincere fears held by the family members, rather it reflected the failures of counsel who represented the claimants and the Board members who determined the decision\".", "[4] In the Immigration Officer's notes on the September 1, 1993 meeting with applicants' counsel, there is reference to certain \"inconsistencies\" in the evidence given by the applicants and which were a matter of concern. These were disclosed to counsel and were later set out in detail in the Immigration Officer's full report to his Senior Immigration Officer. The so-called \"inconsistencies\" relate to the wife of the principal applicant not remembering details of incidents in Iran relating to her husband; to a lack of consistency in recounting an April 1990 incident; to the matter of the husband's pension from his former school where he had long been on the teaching staff; to a May-June 1990 incident where the husband had suffered a broken wrist and had been hospitalized following a beating by unknown assailants; to the vagueness of the applicants' evidence as to the source of financial assistance provided to the applicants for the establishment of their pizza business in Vancouver.", "[5] In the opinion of the Immigration Officer, the foregoing elements in the case were matters of concern which were weighed along with all the other information made available to him and in the end, they prompted him to advise counsel verbally that he would not recommend favourable treatment.", "[6] This was followed by a peremptory letter from counsel dated September 2, 1993, where he expressed strong concerns over two issues, namely: 1. As to the inconsistencies, counsel wanted to speak to his clients and obtain their explanation. 2. As to the Immigration Officer's decision, counsel requested a careful explanation of why the circumstances did not justify inland consideration. Counsel did not want to receive the standard form of refusal. Such a letter, he said, was of absolutely no value. He felt very strongly that the case did deserve inland consideration, and he was most insistent that he be provided with a careful explanation as to why the Immigration Officer disagreed.", "[7] Counsel's letter of September 2, 1993, continued on for some three more pages, rehashing the shortcomings of the Refugee Board's decision on the refugee claim, the complete incompetence of applicants' counsel who had appeared before the Board, the same allegation of incompetence of another counsel in the application before the Federal Court and generally, rearguing the merits of refugee and s. 114 claims alike.", "[8] The decision of the Immigration Officer was confirmed by letter dated September 3, 1993. This prompted counsel, on September 16, 1993, to submit a further lengthy, close-typed brief where he traversed at length the so-called \"inconsistencies\" which had been raised by the Immigration Officer. Counsel argued forcefully that his clients had not had an opportunity to respond. He had in the meantime obtained the tapes of the hearing before the Refugee Board, and there was evidence within those tapes that the so-called \"inconsistencies\" were of no consequence or had not been regarded as inconsistencies at all.", "[9] On a reading of all of counsel's submissions throughout, it is evident that counsel had become so convinced of the righteousness of his clients' case that he could no longer accept with any degree of diffidence anyone else's views. This prompted him to file in these proceedings a lengthy affidavit dated December 2, 1993, setting out his version of conversations, comments, undertakings and what not between the Immigration Officer and himself, which had come out of the August 6, 1993 and September 1, 1993 hearings, and out of some telephone conversations in between. As it turned out, counsel's version was at some variance with the Immigration Officer's own version, the latter also submitting his evidence in affidavit form. Whatever version was to be believed, counsel was able to raise the \"fairness\" issue on grounds that before the Immigration Officer had reached a decision in the case, the applicants had not been given an opportunity to respond to his concerns.", "[10] This doctrine of \"fairness\" has been the subject of a great deal of judicial comment by courts and legal writers. In the case before me, I should not hazard drafting a conspectus on all that has been said on it. I can only comment on the general principle that in matters considered under s. 114(2) of the Immigration Act , the decision to be made is high on the list of exclusive discretionary competence. If one looks at <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 123 (T.D.), a decision of Strayer, J.; at <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  reflect the same theme that in matters of administrative discretion, the processes involved are subject to review only in the most exceptional circumstances. It could be said that the higher the level of exclusive discretion, the lower the level of fairness which would otherwise be imposed.", "[11] Case law recognizes that there is no legal obligation to give reasons under a s. 114(2) refusal. The risk, however, is that if reasons are demanded, as they were in the case at bar, and if an Immigration Officer agrees to make an applicant privy to the considerations which entered his mind in reaching his decision, the open mind becomes a more likely target to challenge. The temptation would be pretty strong that thereafter, the Immigration Officer would play his cards very close to his chest and dehumanize what is fundamentally a humanitarian process.", "[12] Whatever observations might be made on that subject, I may not be satisfied at all that the inconsistencies or discrepancies disclosed by the Immigration Officer are particularly cogent to the determination he had to make. A review of the whole record might be cause to find that, absent any references to those matters of concern to him, the Immigration Officer's decision is nonetheless valid on the merits and well within the field of his competence. This would suggest that in the light of all the circumstances of the case, the issue of fairness is somewhat artificial. It might be technically arguable, but there would not be sufficient substance to it to justify judicial intervention on that ground.", "[13] On the other hand, there are before me the two versions of what took place between the protagonists in the course of the proceedings. I should observe that what is at stake here is not a finding of whose version is right or whose is wrong, or whether either of them is in between, but whether the interests of the applicants have been duly respected. What is of substance is not the tendentious and heavy-handed approach of counsel for the applicants or the open and candid approach of the Immigration Officer in his verbal disclosures to counsel, but whether or not the applicants should have the benefit of the doubt and be given an opportunity to respond to the alleged discrepancies.", "[14] On balance, I should favour the applicants, quash the impugned decision and order a new hearing.

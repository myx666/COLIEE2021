{"id_": "075556", "body_str": ["[1] : This appeal is launched against a decision of the Registrar of trademarks (\"the Registrar\") dated January 25, 1995 wherein he decided pursuant to s. 38(5) of the Trade-marks Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13 (\"the Act \") that the statement of opposition filed by the respondent, Loblaws Inc., in respect of trademark application no. 757,379 for the trademark \"Volcano Hot\" filed by the appellant raised a substantial issue for decision.", "[2] At the outset of the hearing, I raised the issue as to whether such a a preliminary \"decision\" of the Registrar is appealable under s. 56 of the Act . Section 56(1) reads as follows: \"56(1) An appeal lies to the Federal Court from any decision of the Registrar under this Act within two months from the date on which notice of the decision was dispatched by the Registrar or within such further time as the Court may allow, either before or after the expiration of the two months.\"", "[3] The Registrar's decision to the effect that the opposition raised a substantial issue for decision was made under s. 38(5). Section 38 reads as follows: \"38(1) Within two months after the advertisement of an application for the registration of a trademark, any person may, on payment of the prescribed fee, file a statement of opposition with the Registrar. \"(2) A statement of opposition may be based on any of the follow grounds: (a) that the application does not conform to the requirements of section 30; (b) that the trademark is not registrable; (c) that the applicant is not the person entitled to registration of the trademark; or (d) that the trademark is not distinctive. \"(3) A statement of opposition shall set out (a) the grounds of opposition in sufficient detail to enable the applicant to reply thereto; and (b) the address of the opponent's principal office or place of business in Canada, if any, and if the opponent has no office or place of business in Canada, the address of his principal office or place of business abroad and the name and address in Canada of a person or firm on whom service of any document in respect of the opposition may be made with the same effect as if it had been served on the opponent himself. \"(4) If the Registrar considers that the opposition does not raise a substantial issue for decision, he shall reject it and shall give notice of his decision to the opponent. \"(5) If the Registrar considers that the opposition raises a substantial issue for decision, he shall forward a copy of the statement of opposition to the applicant. \"(6) Within the prescribed time after a statement of opposition has been forwarded to him, the applicant may file a counter statement with the Registrar and serve a copy on the opponent in the manner prescribed, and if he does not file and serve a counter statement within the prescribed time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned his application. \"(7) Both the opponent and the applicant shall be given an opportunity, in the manner prescribed, to submit the evidence on which they rely and to be heard by the Registrar if they so desire. \"(8) After hearing the parties, if so required and considering the evidence, the Registrar shall refuse the application or reject the opposition and notify the parties of his decision and his reasons therefor.\"", "[4] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal dealt with a judgment of the Trial Division dismissing the appellant's appeal from a decision of the Registrar wherein he stayed the proceedings instituted by the appellant under the provisions of s. 44 of the Act . Heald, J.A., reviewed the jurisprudence in the matter and concluded that the Trial Division was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. He said (at p. 75) that \"this jurisprudence makes it clear that the court will not review the myriad of decisions or orders customarily rendered on matters which normally arise in the course of a proceeding prior to that final decision\".", "[5] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Cattanach, J., formerly of this court, referred to the Anheuser-Busch Inc . decision and said as follows: \"The approach adopted by Heald, J. [sic], who spoke for the panel, was that the rationale for the determination of what 'decision' of the Registrar of Trademarks was subject to appeal within the meaning of the words 'any decision of the Registrar' as used in s. 56(1) of the Trade-marks Act is susceptible of coinciding with a 'decision' reviewable by the Appeal Division under s. 28 of the Federal Court Act that is, succinctly put, to review the 'final' decision made by any federal board, commission or tribunal other than a decision of an administrative nature not required by law to be made on a judicial or quasi-judicial basis.\"", "[6] As pointed out by counsel for the respondent, counsel for the appellant in the instant case was acting for the appellant in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case. That same line of jurisprudence has been followed by the judges of this court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.); Cullen, J., held that a decision of the Registrar to grant an extension of time for filing an opposition was not appealable under s. 56 of the Act . The following paragraph (at p. 191 [C.P.R.]) is very relevant: \"Under the Trade-marks Act and Rules , the registrar makes several decisions before making his final determination on the opposition pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act . In some instances, preliminary decisions made by the registrar may be final, for example if he rejects the statement of opposition as frivolous under s. 37(4) of the Trade-marks Act Alternatively, if the registrar accepts the statement of opposition as raising substantive grounds, this cannot be considered a final decision because it does not finally determine the rights between the parties .\" (my emphasis)", "[7] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 534 (T.D.), Teitelbaum, J., dealt with a decision of the Registrar to reject certain correspondence on the subject of a trademark application. He held that this was not the type of decision contemplated by s. 56 of the Act . This paragraph (at p. 537) bears reproduction: \"Section 56 speaks of an appeal from any decision of the registrar under the Act . One must therefore look at the Act in order to comprehend what type of decision may be appealed. The type of decision that may be appealed is one made by the registrar pursuant to s. 36 where he decides to refuse an application for the registration of a trademark or pursuant to s. 37(8) where the registrar refuses an application after an opposition was filed or allowed the registration after rejecting an opposition or pursuant to s. 44 where the registrar allowed or refused the expungement of a trademark. An appeal under s. 56 of the Act only lies from a final decision of the registrar involving a trademark and not from a decision of the registrar as to whom he decides he may correspond with pursuant to the Trademarks Regulations .\"", "[8] Finally, in État  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 237 (T.D.), Martin, J., formerly of this court, held that the refusal of the Registrar to order the continuation of a cross-examination was not a final decision and thus not appealable. Referring to the Anheuser-Busch Inc. decision he said as follows (at p. 241): \"It is clear to me from that decision the Federal Court of Appeal has found the word 'decision' in s. 56(1) of the Act is, in the light of the scheme of the Act , to be given a narrow rather than a broad interpretation and that a decision such as that taken by the Registrar to refuse to allow further cross-examination is an interlocutory one and not a final decision contemplated by s. 56(1).\"", "[9] Thus, it is clear from the scheme of the Act and the jurisprudence in the matter that the decision taken by the Registrar under s. 38(8) where, after hearing the parties, he refuses the application or rejects the opposition and notifies the parties of his decision, is a final decision appealable under s. 56. And where the Registrar decides under s. 38(4) that the opposition does not raise a substantial issue, rejects the opposition and gives notice of his decision to the opponent, that decision is also final and appealable under s. 56.", "[10] Counsel for the applicant in the instant case tendered some jurisprudence dealing with decisions under s. 38(4). He could not, however, produce any jurisprudence in support of his assertion that a decision of a Registrar that the opposition raises a substantial issue under s. 38(5) is appealable. Clearly, the Registrar, having decided that there is a substantial issue, must be allowed to continue the process up to the final decision under s. 38(8).", "[11] Consequently, this appeal is premature and is dismissed with costs. Appeal dismissed. Editor: David Weir/slm [End of document]"]}

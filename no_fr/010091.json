{"id_": "010091", "body_str": ["[1] Tremblay-Lamer, J. [Translation]: This is an application for judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act ) of a negative decision by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated July 6, 2006, determining that the applicant is not a Convention refugee as defined in section 96 of the Act or a person in need of protection under section 97 of the Act , on the ground that she is a person referred to in Article 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the Convention ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[2] The applicant, Bety Plaisir, is a citizen of Haiti. She was a member of the intervention and law enforcement special unit (CIMO) of the Haitian national police from September 2002 to July 2005. She had a year of training before she joined the police force.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[3] The applicant arrived in Canada on August 16, 2005, with a Canadian visa, and she claimed refugee protection on September 6, 2005. She alleges that she has a well-founded fear of persecution in Haiti by reason of her membership in her social group, the family. She claims she is afraid of supporters of former President Aristide, who are responsible for torturing and raping her and murdering her father. As the reasons for this treatment, she claims that she and her father were thought to be active members of the Group of 184, a political faction opposed to former President Aristide.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[4] The RPD heard the claim on May 16, 2006. The Minister intervened to ask the RPD to apply the exclusion clauses in Articles 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the Convention on the ground that the applicant was a member of the Haitian national police from 2003 to 2005. The Minister was successful on this issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[5] The RPD determined that, because she had been a member of CIMO, the applicant was involved in abuse and furthering the goals of the police. The RPD determined that she had been sufficiently involved, had been complicit by association in crimes against humanity and was guilty of acting contrary to the goals and principles of the United Nations. She was therefore excluded from the protection provided for Convention refugees pursuant to Articles 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the Convention .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 1. The appropriate standard of review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[6] A decision by the RPD that certain acts fall within the definition of \"crimes against humanity\" is a question of law, and the standard of review is correctness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 170 N.R. 302 (F.C.A.)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[7] The applicant's complicity in acts committed by the Haitian national police and her exclusion under Article 1 of the Convention is a question of mixed law and fact. The applicable standard of review is reasonableness simpliciter ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 302 N.R. 178; 2003 FCA 39; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 289 F.T.R. 1; 2006 FC 1).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 2. Excluding the applicant  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[8] Section 98 of the Act provides that a person referred to in section E and F of Article 1 of the Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[9] Subparagraphs (a) and (c) of section F, which are relevant to this proceeding, read as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"(a) He has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"(c) He has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[10] In Harb , supra, the Federal Court of Appeal held that Article 1F(a) must be interpreted so as to include international instruments concluded since the Convention was adopted in 1951, including the definition of \"crime against humanity\" in the Rome Statute , which was adopted on July 17, 1998, and came into effect on July 1, 2002.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[11] Paragraph 7(1) of the Rome Statute (see Appendix) states that a \"crime against humanity\" is \"committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population\" and includes murder, torture, rape, persecution against any identifiable group on political, racial, national, ethnic or cultural grounds, and other inhumane acts of a similar character.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[12] Paragraph 7(2) of the same Statute provides that such an attack against a population involves the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 \"pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack ...\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[13] The situation envisaged is not one in which isolated incidents of international offences have occurred but where the commission of such offences is a continuous and regular part of the operation <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 163 N.R. 197 (F.C.A.); Penate , infra).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[14] The onus is on the Minister to lead evidence demonstrating that there are \"serious reasons for considering\" that the applicant has been complicit in crimes against humanity ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The applicable standard of proof is something more than mere suspicion but less than the balance of probabilities standard ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[15] The purpose of Article 1F(c) is to exclude those individuals responsible for serious, sustained or systemic violations of fundamental human rights which amount to persecution in a non-war setting ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Complicity by association  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[16] Complicity by association means that a person may be held responsible for crimes committed by others because of his or her close association with those who committed them ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[17] In such circumstances, it is the nature of the crimes alleged against the organization with which the person is associated that leads to his or her exclusion ( Harb , supra).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[18] A refugee claimant is excluded for complicity if the claimant is a member of a group that has committed a crime against humanity, has knowledge of the group's activities, actively supports the group and has failed to disengage himself or herself from it at the earliest opportunity ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[19] Essentially, complicity rests on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have of it ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 205 N.R. 282 (F.C.A.)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[20] Mere membership in an organization that commits international crimes is an insufficient basis on which to invoke the exclusion clause against the applicant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), unless the very existence of this organization is primarily directed to a limited, brutal purpose ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[21] However, association with an organization responsible for international crimes may constitute complicity if there is personal and knowing participation or toleration of the crimes ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 13).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[22] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Mr. Justice Yves de Montigny summarized the mental element required to establish complicity in crimes against humanity as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"The mental element required to establish complicity in crimes against humanity has been characterized variously as 'shared common purpose', 'personal and knowing participation or toleration of the crimes', and participation in an organization knowing it commits crimes against humanity, when combined with a failure to stop the crimes or disassociate oneself. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[23] Moreover, the case for an individual's complicity in international crimes committed by his or her organization is stronger if the individual member in question holds a position of importance within the organization. The closer one is to being a leader rather than an ordinary member, the more likely it is that an inference will be drawn that one knew of the crime and shared the organization's purpose in committing that crime. In such circumstances, an important factor to consider is evidence that the individual protested against the crime or tried to stop its commission or attempted to withdraw from the organization ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Application to this case  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[24] The first thing I noted in this case is that the RPD did not analyze the nature of the organization concerned. Is it an organization that is directed to a limited, brutal purpose, in which case mere membership inevitably implies personal and knowing participation? If not, did the organization regularly and continuously commit crimes against humanity when the applicant was a member?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[25] The RPD is silent on the matter. The panel merely conducted \"a review of the documentation on the situation in Haiti\" without identifying exactly which crimes CIMO committed and whether these crimes were isolated incidents or were regularly part of the operation of CIMO. In this regard, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , states that it is not sufficient to identify isolated incidents, but rather where the commission of such offences is a continuous and regular part of the operation of the organization concerned . The RPD did not satisfactorily deal with the continuous nature in these circumstances.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[26] As for the applicant's complicity by association, since mere membership in the organization was insufficient, the RPD had to identify \"the existence of a shared common purpose\" and \"the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have of it\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[27] The case law has established the factors to consider when ruling on this issue: the method of recruitment, the applicant's position and rank in the organization, the nature of the organization, the applicant's knowledge of the organization's atrocities, the length of time in the organization and the opportunity to leave the organization ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 279 F.T.R. 296; 2005 FC 1306; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 277 F.T.R. 20; 2005 FC 1028).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[28] In this case, the evidence shows that the applicant joined CIMO of her own free will. Nevertheless, she had an administrative position at the reception area at CIMO's office. She was involved in only three field operations, during demonstrations in Port-au-Prince.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[29] The applicant admitted she knew about the demonstrations in the country, but she maintained that she was not aware of CIMO's bad reputation before she joined the organization. The fact that she stated which equipment the members of her group had and the way how the unit exercised crowd control is insufficient to conclude that she was aware of the atrocities committed by the Haitian police. As for the other factors, the RPD was mute on the nature of the organization, the applicant's participation in its activities and whether she was able to leave CIMO at the first available opportunity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[30] In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal emphasized that the RPD is required to set out factual findings in support of its decision to exclude a refugee claimant from the Convention . Providing insufficient findings of fact constitutes an error of law. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 278 F.T.R. 229; 2005 FC 762, at paragraph 29).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[31] The RPD essentially determined that the applicant's mere association with CIMO was sufficient evidence to prove her involvement.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[32] However, passive acquiescence is not a sufficient basis for invoking the exclusion clause ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[33] As stated by Mr. Justice Joseph Robertson in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 50:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"It is settled law that acts or omissions amounting to passive acquiescence are not a sufficient basis for invoking the exclusion clause. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[34] Basically, the RPD's analysis of CIMO's activities was deficient and was not sufficient in demonstrating that the organization regularly and continuously committed crimes against humanity. In addition, the reasons for the decision did not establish that the panel considered the required factors in determining whether the applicant was complicit by association.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[35] For the above reasons, the application for judicial review is allowed, the RPD's decision to exclude the applicant is set aside and the matter, including the application of section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act , is remitted for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[36] The application for judicial review is allowed, the RPD's decision to exclude the applicant is set aside and the matter, including the application of section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act , is remitted for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Application allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Editor: Anick Ouellette-Levesque/pdk  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Appendix A  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Statutory Provisions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states that the term \"Refugee Convention\" means the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , signed at Geneva on July 28, 1951.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 2(1) The definitions in this subsection apply in this Act.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"Refugee Convention <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Refugee Convention means the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, signed at Geneva on July 28, 1951, and the Protocol to that Convention, signed at New York on January 31, 1967.

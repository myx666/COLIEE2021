{"id_": "023554", "body_str": ["[1] Simpson, J. : The respondent has moved pursuant to rule 324 to strike out all those portions of the affidavit of Kathy Vandervennen sworn on November 15, 1993 (the affidavit) which survived an order made by Mr. Justice Nadon on January 11, 1994. In that order he struck out exhibits B and D to the affidavit and all references thereto in the narrative portion of the affidavit. This meant that paragraph 3 of the affidavit was struck out along with the fifth sentence of paragraph 2.", "[2] The affidavit is a further affidavit which was filed pursuant to paragraph 5 of the order of Mr. Justice McKeown dated October 12, 1993 in which leave for judicial review was granted.", "[3] The issue today is whether exhibits A and C to the affidavit should be struck out. Background", "[4] Joycelyn Gyimah (the applicant) is Ghanaian. On February 10, 1993 the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the \"Board\") issued a decision which denied her claim to be a Convention refugee on the basis that her evidence was not credible. In particular, the Board found that an alleged summons from the Committee for the Defence of the Revolution, which accused the applicant of violating two laws and required her to appear before a public tribunal, was not credible. Exhibit A", "[5] Exhibit A is an Immigration and Refugee Board Memorandum dated May 1992 from Pierre Bourget, the Director General, OPP, to the Executive Director. It is entitled Consistency Project Final Report on Meetings (the \"Report\"). It shows a distribution list which includes, inter alia, 12 Board members from Toronto.", "[6] Counsel for the respondent argued that the Report is not a statement of Board policy. The cover sheet reads: \"Attached is a copy of the Hearings Division Final Report on the Consistency Project Meetings. \"The Hearings Division will continue to report on the implementation of any of the recommendations contained therein as may be adopted by the Board.\"", "[7] The Report reflects the final recommendations of the 24 people involved in the Consistency Project. It clearly does not reflect Board policy and there is no evidence that any of the recommendations were distributed to the Board's members or eventually implemented. The Report deals in part with Ghana and it notes at p. 55 of the Exhibit that no recommendation is made about the Ghanaian Public Tribunal system.", "[8] However, the passages which raised a concern for the applicant's counsel are set out at p. 56 of the Exhibit. They read: \"(3) Credibility \"Assessment of the claimant's credibility was thought to be a critical issue in Ghananian claims. The members decided that improved cross-cultural understanding would be helpful in assessing credibility as would be access to first level information such as border notes. An issue which was not discussed at the meeting but might require future analysis was whether differences in acceptance rates are affected by the different ways of assessing credibility. That is, members having different 'thresholds' defining the point at which incredible statements lead to an overall finding of lack of credibility. The Legal Services analysis on Ghananian decisions concluded that there did not appear to be any differences between regions on the panel's treatment of credibility issues. However, a systematic monitoring of hearings may shed more light on this issue than a sample review of written reasons. Information requirements: speaker on cultural issues, access to first level information such as case claim highlights and documents access to information from Canadian High Commissions (regarding security practices) \"(4) Former CDOs/CDRs \"It was decided that members will check carefully for possible exclusion issues when faced with a former member of a CDR or CDO. Recent caselaw on exclusion issues was discussed. Information requirements: example of membership card, updated issue paper, more information on local level and regional differences and relationship with BNI.\"", "[9] Applicant's counsel acknowledged that exclusion issues are not relevant to his client but cited point 4 above in an effort to persuade me that policy was decided. In view of the language of the covering memo quoted earlier, I am not so persuaded.", "[10] The statement at point 3 raises the principal concern. Counsel for the applicant argued that, once the Report made the statement that credibility is critical in Ghanaian claims, then a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of all Board Members arose because credibility is always at issue and to say that it is a \"critical\" issue is to say that all Ghanaians are liars who rely on forged documents. He further submits that, because of this language in the Report, the Board Members will be more suspicious of Ghanaians than of other claimants and will be tougher in their assessments of Ghanaians' credibility because they will know that their findings may be monitored or scrutinized.", "[11] This argument cannot succeed in the absence of any nexus between the Report and the conduct of the applicant's hearing. There is simply no evidence that point 3 was ever discussed much less ever accepted by the Board as policy. There is no evidence that it was even circulated. The Board members who conducted the applicant's hearing were not copied with the Report. Applicant's counsel says that the Report caused the Board Members who heard the applicant's refugee claim to be disposed to make negative findings about her credibility. On the facts of this case I cannot agree. Accordingly, the Report (exhibit A) is irrelevant and is struck from the Affidavit. Exhibit C", "[12] Exhibit C is a compilation of materials under the title Submission to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Employment and Immigration submitted on August 26, 1993 by Attorney Richard Kurland of Montreal.", "[13] Counsel for the applicant suggested in oral argument, though not in his written memorandum, that Exhibit C is relevant because it contains information to demonstrate that Refugee Hearing Officers often speak with Board Members about cases without the knowledge of the applicants or their counsel. Accordingly, I am asked to infer that the Board Members, including those who conducted the applicant's hearing, all had discussions about and were aware of the Report. This leap of logic is not one I can comfortably make. Exhibit C is therefore also struck out as being irrelevant on the facts of this case.", "[14] I do, however, echo the comments made by my colleague Mr. Justice McKeown in his reasons in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, when he suggested that the Board should make it clear to all Board Members that there can be no consistency with respect to findings of credibility and that credibility cannot be prejudged. It is an issue to be determined by the Board Members in each case based on individual claimants and their evidence.", "[15] For all these reasons, the applicant is allowed. Application allowed.

{"id_": "031918", "body_str": ["[1] Boivin, J. [Translation]: This is an application for judicial review under section 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ),RSC, 1985, c F-7, and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act , SC 1992, c 20 (\"CCRA\"), of certain decisions made by the Correctional Service of Canada ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The applicant is hereby asking the Court to review his security classification and to transfer him to a minimum security institution close to his family. Factual background", "[2] The applicant is an inmate at the Port-Cartier Institution, a federal maximum security penitentiary in Port-Cartier, Quebec. He has been serving a prison sentence since being convicted of robbery and fraud.", "[3] According to the provisions of the CCRA, a security classification is assigned to all offenders. On July 29, 2009, when the applicant was at the Warkworth Institution in Ontario, the CSC calculated the applicant's security classification using the Security Reclassification Scale. The result was 26 points. Although this result corresponds to a medium security classification, it also falls within the 5% discretionary range that justifies a maximum security classification.", "[4] On August 21, 2009, the applicant's security classification was evaluated by his parole officer at the Warkworth Institution. The following classifications were recommended: a maximum classification for institutional adjustment, a medium classification for escape risk, a maximum classification for risk to public safety and a maximum classification for security level. These recommendations were approved by the warden of the Warkworth Institution.", "[5] On August 26, 2009, the applicant filed a second level grievance with the CSC to challenge the decision on his security classification evaluation.", "[6] On November 30, 2009, a second level grievance decision was issued, confirming the applicant's maximum security classification.", "[7] On January 8, 2010, the applicant filed a third level grievance with the CSC.", "[8] A few months after he filed his third level grievance, the applicant contacted the Office of the Correctional Investigator Canada to enquire about the status of his third level grievance.", "[9] In a letter dated July 12, 2010, Sofia Gutierrez, an investigator with the Office of the Correctional Investigator (a distinct government branch from the CSC), wrote to the applicant to inform him that she had contacted the Offender Redress Division at National Headquarters to find out why it was taking so long to respond. Ms. Gutierrez wrote in her letter that there had been a policy breach in the processing of the applicant's grievance.", "[10] In a letter dated August 19, 2010, the CSC's Offender Redress Division (National Headquarters) acknowledged receipt of the applicant's third level grievance and informed him that a response would be sent no later than December 13, 2010.", "[11] During the week of August 20, 2010, the applicant filed an application for judicial review with the Federal Court. The application was received on August 25, 2010. The main goals of his application were a review of his maximum security classification and a transfer to a minimum security institution close to his family.", "[12] On September 24, 2010, the applicant received a letter from the Executive Director and General Counsel of the Office of the Correctional Investigator, Ivan Zinger. In his letter, Mr. Zinger acknowledged the delay in responding to the applicant's grievance. He explained that the applicant's situation was [translation] \"much too common and [that] delays in processing complaints and grievances by Canada's correctional system are a systemic problem\".", "[13] On October 8, 2010, the respondent wrote to the applicant to again explain that CSC would be deciding on his third level grievance before December 13, 2010.", "[14] On December 10, 2010, the CSC issued a third level decision concerning the applicant's grievance. The applicant's grievance was allowed in part. The applicant received a copy of the decision on December 13, 2010.", "[15] On December 21, 2010, the respondent wrote the applicant a letter, reminding him that the CSC had made a decision concerning his third level grievance and asking him to withdraw his application for judicial review before January 15, 2011. In that letter, the respondent informed the applicant that his application had become moot.", "[16] Since the applicant's application for judicial review was not withdrawn, the respondent filed a motion to strike the notice of application on February 28, 2011. On March 22, 2011, Justice Martineau issued an order dismissing the respondent's motion to strike. Justice Martineau indicated that he was not satisfied that the application for judicial review had become completely academic, noting that a tangible and concrete dispute still seemed to exist.", "[17] On April 27, 2011, the applicant's security classification was reduced to medium, and the applicant read this decision on May 2, 2011.", "[18] On June 20, 2011, the applicant submitted a request to be transferred from the Port-Cartier Institution to the Archambault Institution. This request is currently being processed.", "[19] The applicant did not file a new application for judicial review of the third level decision issued on December 10, 2010. Issues", "[20] Several issues have been raised. Essentially, the Court finds that the following questions are relevant in this case: 1. Has the application for judicial review become moot or academic? If the answer to this question is no: 2. Is the application for judicial review interlocutory? 3. Can the applicant use the present application for judicial review, which was filed on August 25, 2010, to challenge the second level grievance response issued on November 30, 2009 or the third level grievance response issued on December 10, 2010? Relevant legislation", "[21] The relevant legislation is reproduced in Appendix A. Analysis 1. Has the application for judicial review become moot or academic?", "[22] The applicant alleges that even though the respondent replied to his third level grievance on December 10, 2010, there is still an issue to be resolved ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  176 FTR 252). He submits that he waited 11 months for a response and that the CSC grievance system does not work. The applicant also refers to Justice Martineau's order regarding the motion to strike dated March 22, 2011, in which the judge stated that a tangible and concrete issue remained to be resolved.", "[23] The respondent cites <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and submits that the present application is moot since the CSC issued a response to the third level grievance on December 10, 2010. The respondent also argues that judicial review before the Federal Court is not the appropriate medium for settling all of the applicant's grievances.", "[24] The Court points out that in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada developed the mootness doctrine. Essentially, the Supreme Court of Canada discussed the parameters of a practice that allows a court to decline to decide a case which raises merely a hypothetical or abstract question. A controversy must exist not only when the application for judicial review is instituted, but also at any other moment during the proceeding. Consequently, an issue can become moot if it is resolved as the result of events occurring during the course of the judicial review.", "[25] The approach involves two steps. First it is necessary to determine whether the required tangible and concrete dispute has disappeared and the issues have become academic. Second, if the response to the first question is affirmative, it is necessary to decide if the court should exercise its discretion to hear the case.", "[26] At the second stage, three factors must be considered to determine whether the Court is able to exercise its discretion: (i) the existence of the adversarial system; (ii) judicial economy; and (iii) the need for courts to demonstrate some sensitivity to the effectiveness or efficacy of judicial intervention and to be aware of the judiciary's role in our political framework.", "[27] After having read the applicant's application for judicial review and heard the parties, the Court is of the view that, in his application, the applicant is actually seeking a mandamus. In fact, the applicant's application is not concerned with any particular decision but rather with compelling National Headquarters to issue a decision regarding his third level grievance: [translation] This is the purpose of my application for judicial review. I filed a third level grievance in January 2010 (Reference No.V40A00034617), which was given to the warden, Th√©resa Westfall, to challenge my security classification, which was 23.5 at the 2009-08-07 evaluation (sic) the score was 23.5; however, I never received a response. (Applicant's Record, p. 2)", "[28] In light of the principles described, the Court finds that the applicant's application has become moot since the CSC issued a response to the applicant's third level grievance in December 2010, thus resolving the issue. The Court also finds that the applicant did not exhaust all internal remedies before filing his application for judicial review and that there are no exceptional circumstances ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 367). In that sense, the present application for judicial review is interlocutory.", "[29] The Court also notes that at no point did the applicant amend his notice of application for judicial review or directly challenge the third level decision issued in December 2010. The Court furthermore notes that the applicant's classification was reduced to medium on April 27, 2011.", "[30] The fact that the application is academic and moot is enough to dispose of the matter. The Court therefore does not have to deal with questions 2 and 3. The Court will deal nonetheless with certain questions discussed at the hearing in the hope that this will be useful for the parties.", "[31] First, it should be noted that the CCRA, the Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations (the Regulations) and Commissioner's Directive No. 81, Offender Complaints and Grievances (CD 081) (Appendix A) introduce a comprehensive grievance process in the corrections system.", "[32] Specifically, under section 27 of CD 081, the complaint and grievance process includes four levels: written complaints, first level grievances, second level grievances and third level grievances. Section 30 of CD 081 provides that grievers can apply for judicial review of the final decision with the Federal Court under subsection 18.1(2) of the Federal Courts Act", "[33] The Court also points out that the case law demonstrates that, in principle, a person can turn to the courts but only after having exhausted all possible remedies available in the administrative process. As a general rule, therefore, judicial review should not be allowed where an adequate alternative remedy exists ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).", "[34] The doctrine of exhaustion was recently clearly described by the Federal Court of Appeal in C.B. Powell Ltd (above). The Federal Court of Appeal reiterated that, to prevent fragmentation of the administrative process and piecemeal court proceedings, absent exceptional circumstances, parties cannot proceed to the court system until the administrative process has run its course and has finished. The Federal Court of Appeal also confirmed that very few circumstances qualify as \"exceptional\".", "[35] In his application for judicial review, the applicant in fact admits that he did not exhaust the CSC grievance process because he wanted to obtain a response to his grievance. He alleges that the CSC took too much time to render a decision. At the hearing, the parties referred to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In the Court's opinion, these decisions do not apply to the facts of the present matter, for the following reasons.", "[36] In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant had every reason to believe that, given the difficulties he had experienced at the second level of the grievance resolution procedure, it was likely that he would not receive a quick response at the third level. In that case, the applicant had received a decision at the second level. He had then applied for judicial review within the required timeframe, namely, within 30 days of the decision (subsection 18.1(2) of the Federal Courts Act ). After hearing the case on its merits, the Court dismissed the application for judicial review. The facts raised in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> do not apply in the present matter because the second level decision was issued within a reasonable timeframe; the application for judicial does not concern the second level decision; and the goal of the application filed by the applicant in the present case was to accelerate the third level decision.", "[37] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> involved an application for judicial review of a refusal to re-evaluate the classification of the inmate in question and to transfer him. In that case, the Court found that, in light of evidence indicating that the CSC had not acted independently and that other government agencies had dictated its decisions, the circumstances warranted an exception to the general rule that internal remedies should be exhausted beforehand. Consequently, the Court determined that the application for judicial review was appropriate. However, in the case at bar, the evidence does not demonstrate that the CSC was influenced by another agency and, consequently, did not act independently. The decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> therefore does not apply in the present matter.", "[38] The Court nonetheless observes that, in light of the record, and this despite there being some mitigating factors, the CSC did not comply with its own policy described in CD 081 in terms of its analysis and processing of the applicant's third level grievance (letter from Sofia Gutierrez, Investigator, Officer of the Correctional Investigator, July 12, 1010; letter from Ivan Zinger, Executive Director and General Counsel, Office of the Correctional Investigator, September 24, 2010).", "[39] In sum, and in light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the applicant cannot use the present application for judicial review to challenge the response to the second level grievance dated November 30, 2009, or the response to the third level grievance dated December 10, 2010.", "[40] The application for judicial review filed by the applicant is moot and academic. It will therefore be dismissed.", "[41] Given the result, costs would normally follow the event and be awarded to the respondent. Even though this issue has become moot and academic, it once again highlights certain deficiencies in the processing of inmates' complaints. In these circumstances, the Court will exercise its discretion and make no order as to costs. JUDGMENT", "[42] THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that the application for judicial review be dismissed, without costs.

{"id_": "061938", "body_str": ["[1] Tremblay-Lamer, J. : This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act ), for judicial review of a decision of an immigration officer, refusing the applicant's application for permanent residence under the spouse or common-law partner in Canada Class given that she did not meet the requirements of s. 72(1)(e)(i) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations , SOR/2002-227 (the Regulations ) as her dependent son was found inadmissible due to criminality.", "[2] The applicant is a Polish citizen. She submitted an application for permanent residence in Canada as a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada Class. The application was sponsored by her Canadian husband.", "[3] In a fairness letter dated August 14, 2007 from Citizenship and Immigration Canada, she was advised that her application for landing may have to be refused because her son was convicted of a criminal offence in 2005 for threatening to cause bodily harm to another person.", "[4] The applicant submitted a reply to the fairness letter on October 15, 2007 which indicated that while when the application was submitted, her son was 21 years old and also was a full-time student and thus a dependent and a family member pursuant to the legislation, he has since turned 22, is no longer a student, is currently working in London, England and is financially independent. The applicant submitted that her son should be removed from her application.", "[5] On December 5, 2007, the applicant's application was refused. In refusing the application, the officer indicated the following in the FOSS notes: \"On review, I find: - Son Igor is a dependant, due to his age at the time this application was received (lock-in date). Such dependancy [sic] is not affected by the submitted changes in the son's circumstances nor the time required for processing this application.\" Given the inadmissibility of her dependent son, the applicant was found not to have met the requirements of s. 72(1)(e)(i) of the Regulations THE ISSUES", "[6] The present application raises the following issues: 1. Is the applicant's son a \"family member\" as defined by the Regulations 2. What is the effect of s. 42 of the Act and s. 23 of the Regulations LEGISLATION", "[7] The pertinent legislation is found in Annex A [omitted]. STANDARD OF REVIEW", "[8] The first issue is a question of mixed fact and law involving the determination of whether, on the particular facts of this case, the applicant's son meets the definition of \"family member\" under the Regulations . Questions where the legal issues cannot easily be separated from factual issues generally attract a standard of reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , below, at para. 51).", "[9] The second issue before the Court involves the interpretation of the Act and Regulations , and as such constitutes a question of pure law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 352 N.R. 85; 2006 FCA 217, at para. 18). While the Supreme Court of Canada has indicated that generally questions of law will attract a standard of correctness, some legal issues may attract the more deferential standard of reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 51).", "[10] In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Supreme Court held that the proper standard of review depends upon the presence or absence of a privative clause, a discrete and special administrative regime in which the decision maker has special expertise, and the nature of the question as being of central importance to the legal system and thus outside the specialized area of the decision-maker's expertise (at para. 55).", "[11] There is no privative clause precluding judicial review contained in the Act , however, I am of the view that the Act and Regulations in question do represent a discrete and special administrative regime in which the decision-maker has special expertise, and that the issues raised in the present application fall within the special administrative regime in which the decision maker has that special expertise. Based on this, in my opinion, the standard of review applicable to both questions is that of reasonableness.", "[12] Despite the fact that one of the issues before the Court is a question of law, I note that \"[t]here is nothing unprincipled in the fact that some questions of law will be decided on the basis of reasonableness\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 56).", "[13] Thus, \"the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also] [...] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" will form the basis of the present exercise of judicial review ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 47). ANALYSIS Is the applicant's son a \"family member\" as defined by the Regulations?", "[14] Pursuant to s. 72(1) of the Regulations , foreign nationals in Canada become permanent residents, if following an examination, it is established that they meet the criteria of the particular provision including the selection criteria and other requirements applicable to the class they have applied under and do not fall under one of the exceptions set out in the provision. The relevant exception for the purposes of the present application being that \"they and their family members whether accompanying or not, are not inadmissible.\" section 36(2)(b) of the Act sets out that a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of criminality for \"having been convicted outside Canada of an offence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence under an Act of Parliament, or of two offences not arising out of a single occurrence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute offences under an Act of Parliament\".", "[15] Under s. 1(3) of the Regulations , \"family member\" is defined as (a) the spouse or common-law partner of the person, (b) a dependent child of the person or of the person's spouse or common-law partner, and a dependent child of a dependent child referred to in paragraph (b).", "[16] Further, s. 2 of the Regulations provides the definition of \"dependent child\". The section sets out categories within which an individual must fall to meet the definition. The pertinent sections of that provision for the purposes of the present judicial review indicate that a dependent child is a biological child of the parent, if the child has not been adopted by a person other than the spouse or common-law partner of the parent, and if the child is in one of three situations of dependency. The first situation is that the child is less than 22 years old and not a spouse or common-law partner, and the second is that the child has depended substantially on the financial support of the parent since before the age of 22 and since before the age of 22 has been a student \"continuously enrolled in and attending a post-secondary institution that is accredited by the relevant government authority\" and \"actively pursuing a course of academic, professional or vocational training on a full-time basis.\" The third situation is that the child is 22 years of age or older, has depended substantially on the financial support of the parent since before the age of 22, and has a physical or mental condition which makes him unable to be financially self-supporting.", "[17] Further, section 121 of the Regulations states that a family member of an applicant under Division 6 of Part 5 of the Regulations must meet the definition both when the application is made and when it is determined except with respect to whether he has attained 22 years of age.", "[18] The tribunal record indicates that the applicant's son was less than 22 years of age at the time the application was made, and had completed his studies by June 2007 before a final determination of the application had occurred. However, in spite of the fact that the son's student status has changed since the applicant submitted the application, the fact that the lock-in date for age is the time at which the application was submitted indicates that he is still considered a dependent child under s. 2(b)(i) of the Regulations . Accordingly, as a dependent child, he is a \"family member\" pursuant to s. 1(3) of the Regulations . This was the conclusion reached by the officer and it was reasonable. What is the effect of s. 42 of the Act and s. 23 of the Regulations?", "[19] In the division of the Act relating to inadmissibility, s. 42(a) stipulates that a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of an inadmissible, non-accompanying family member under prescribed circumstances. Those prescribed circumstances are laid out in s. 23 of the Regulations , the most relevant of which for the present case is s. 23(b)(iii) which indicates that a foreign national may be inadmissible if a non-accompanying family member is inadmissible and is the \"dependent child of the foreign national and either the foreign national or an accompanying family member of the foreign national has custody of that child or is empowered to act on behalf of that child by virtue of a court order or written agreement or by operation of law\".", "[20] As previously stated, in order to be granted permanent residency as per s. 72(1)(e)(i) of the Regulations , the family members of a foreign national, whether accompanying or non-accompanying must not be inadmissible. The applicant's son is a non-accompanying family member, and he is inadmissible.", "[21] On one hand, the applicant submits that in this case, the additional criteria of the dependent child being in the custody of the foreign national or an accompanying family member, or that the foreign national or accompanying family member are authorized to act on behalf of the dependent child by virtue of a court order, written agreement, or by operation of law, are not met.", "[22] On the other hand, the respondent argues that the applicant was not found inadmissible pursuant to s. 42 of the Act , but rather that she did not qualify for a permanent resident visa under s. 72(1)(e)(i) of the Regulations", "[23] While the fairness letter sent to the applicant on August 14, 2007 refers both to s. 72(1)(e)(i) of the Regulations and s. 42 of the Act , the decision dated December 5, 2007 made reference solely to s. 72(1)(e)(i) of the Regulations . When examining s. 72(1)(e)(i) of the Regulations and s. 42(a) of the Act it must be born in mind that while they may deal with similar subject matters, such as inadmissible family members, the former provision involves a determination as to whether or not a foreign national has met the requirements for obtaining permanent residence, while the latter involves a determination as to the admissibility of a foreign national. The provisions relating to admissibility are found in a distinct division of the Act and a distinct part of the Regulations and an individual who is found inadmissible pursuant to these provisions, may be subject to different consequences than someone who is found not to have met the requirements for permanent residency. In the present case, while the applicant's son was found inadmissible, the applicant was not. I stress that she was found only not to have met the requirements stipulated in s. 72(1)(e)(i) of the Regulations", "[24] I am of the view that the officer's interpretation of the Act and Regulations falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 47). As s. 42 of the Act deals with admissibility, it was reasonable for the officer not to apply this provision in the present case.", "[25] I would add that the applicant is entitled to apply for permanent residency again, and as her inadmissible son would no longer be considered a dependent child and thus a \"family member\" there should be no impediments to its approval if all other requirements are met.", "[26] For the preceding reasons, the present application for judicial review is dismissed. JUDGMENT", "[27] THIS COURT ORDERS that the present application for judicial review is dismissed. Application dismissed. Editor: Angela E.

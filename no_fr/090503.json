{"id_": "090503", "body_str": ["[1] Layden-Stevenson, J. : The Veterans Review and Appeal Board of Canada (the Board) was required to determine the entitlement, if any, of James MacDonald, a 17-year retiree from the RCMP, to a pension for disabilities allegedly resulting from his service as a member of the RCMP Musical Ride.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[2] This judicial review of the Board's decision turns on the analysis provided by the Board in its reasons for rejecting Mr. MacDonald's claim. More specifically, it is concerned with whether the Board's decision exhibits the existence of justification, intelligibility and transparency.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[3] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the matter must be returned to the Board because its determination lacks a proper analysis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Background  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[4] Synoptically, Mr. MacDonald served as a member of the RCMP for 13 years (1973-1986). In 1980, he was posted to the RCMP Musical Ride. Upon completion of the Musical Ride assignment, he was transferred to the Federal Policing Branch Headquarters in Ottawa and then to the Commercial Crime Section in Toronto.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[5] Mr. MacDonald applied for a disability pension, pursuant to section 32 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. R-11 (the RCMPSA ), claiming that his foot conditions (pes planus and plantar facilitis) as well as his nasal conditions (chronic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis) arose as a result of injury or aggravation directly connected with his service in the Musical Ride.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[6] In particular, Mr. MacDonald attributes his foot problems to riding boots, foot positioning while riding, dismounting (onto a concrete floor) and carrying heavy tack boxes while on tour. He traces his nasal conditions to an experience at the RCMP breeding ranch. Apparently, Mr. MacDonald sustained a severe reaction when he was tasked to pile hay inside a storage building. In subsequent years, the \"allergies\" worsened. Mr. MacDonald repeatedly used \"over the counter\" medications to ameliorate his breathing problems. Eventually, he developed polyps in his nasal passages. The polyps severely compromise his breathing and sense of smell. The foot conditions significantly limit his capacity to engage in physical activity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[7] Dr. Ian Dempsey examined Mr. MacDonald in 1997 and again in 2003. In correspondence, dated February 16, 2006, Dr. Dempsey describes the \"exposure to hay with high levels of airborne particulate matter\" as being a \"trigger\" for some of Mr. MacDonald's symptoms.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[8] In accordance with the statutory regime, the first-level decision with respect to claims of this nature is rendered by a first-level decision-maker, a ministerial delegate. The ministerial delegate denied the claim essentially on the basis that the service records did not substantiate the conclusion that the alleged disabilities were causally related to past RCMP service.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[9] Pursuant to section 18 of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act , S.C. 1995, c. 18 (the VRAB Act ), Mr. MacDonald requested that an Entitlement Review Panel (ERP) review the ministerial delegate's decision. The ERP examined the evidence and determined, notwithstanding the medical reports, that pension entitlement was not indicated primarily for the reasons enunciated by the ministerial delegate, i.e., service records do \"not provide medical evidence to determine a causal relationship between factors associated with the applicant's RCMP service and the development of his claimed conditions in the post-discharge period\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[10] Under section 25 of the VRAB Act , Mr. MacDonald appealed the ERP's decision to the Board. The Board dismissed his appeal. It is the Board's decision that is the subject of this judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> The Relevant Statutory Provisions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[11] The text of the relevant statutory provisions is attached to these reasons as Schedule \"A\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> The Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[12] The Board concluded that the available facts and evidence do not support the claim on the foot conditions. The medical opinions are not supported by evidence. Regarding the nasal conditions, the Board concluded that the medical opinion is not supported by the facts available throughout the statement of the case. Specifically, there is no report of a problem immediately following the exposure to the hay dust and no recorded complaints during Mr. MacDonald's service in the Musical Ride.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> The Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[13] Although the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( ) was released subsequent to the filing of the written submissions, both parties incorporated into their oral arguments. They agree, and I concur, that the applicable standard of review regarding the Board's decision is reasonableness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[14] directs that where the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question, there is no need to engage in what is now referred to as a \"standard of review analysis\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[15] With respect to the determination as to whether an award should be made under section 32 of the RCMPSA , the Federal Court of Appeal established in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) ( Wannamaker ) that the standard of review is reasonableness. The Court concluded, with respect to whether there is a causal connection between an injury and a disability, that the Board's assessment attracted the more deferential standard of patent unreasonableness. Since this standard has now been collapsed under the reasonableness standard of review, this issue is also subject to review on the reasonableness standard: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 13 ( Goldsworthy ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[16] Mr. MacDonald had to satisfy the Board that he sustained an injury as a result of his service and that a causal connection exists between the injury and the disability. At the time of his application, he had been out of the RCMP for 17 years.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[17] It is beyond dispute that the Board is not required to accept a medical opinion that is speculative. Nor is it required to accept a medical opinion where the medical specialist is not in a position to know whether the patient's account of the injury is correct: Wannamaker Goldsworthy <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.), affd. (2007), 360 N.R. 323 (F.C.A.) ( Comeau ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[18] Section 39 of the VRAB Act requires the Board, when weighing the evidence, to resolve any doubt in favour of the applicant. However, it does not relieve the pension applicant of the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, the facts required to establish entitlement to a pension. Nor does it require the Board to accept all evidence presented by the applicant if it finds that evidence not to be credible, even if it is not contradicted. Evidence is credible if it is plausible, reliable and logically capable of proving the fact it is intended to prove: Wannamaker .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[19] Mr. MacDonald provided a lengthy chronology with respect to what he considered to be the onset of his injuries. The Board does not make a negative credibility finding. Nor does it address Mr. MacDonald's evidence. Perhaps the Board did not find it plausible, or reliable, or logically capable of proving the injury or the casual connection between the injury and the disability. Or, perhaps the Board simply did not believe him. It was open to the Board to reject Mr. MacDonald's evidence for all or even one of these reasons. It does not do so.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[20] The Board refers to Dr. Somerfield's opinion and notes that he \"did not include any medical evidence to support his opinion\". Nothing further is stated. Perhaps, by implication, this constitutes, or is intended to constitute, a rejection of Dr. Somerfield's opinion. Or, perhaps it constitutes an observation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[21] In the \"introduction\" portion of its decision, the Board states that it has examined all of the testimony and documented evidence in addition to four exhibits, one of which is an excerpt from Mr. MacDonald's service records regarding physiotherapy treatments for right Achilles tendonitis in 1985 and 1986. There is no further reference to this evidence. It is clear that Mr. MacDonald considered the excerpt to be an important one with respect to substantiating his claim. It was open to the board to find otherwise. It does not do so.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[22] Instead, the Board states that it has taken everything into account and finds that \"the claim is not supported by the facts and the evidence available to the board\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) ( Whitehead ), Mr. Justice Gibson, in addressing reasons of a similar nature, concluded that while the decision of the Board may have been reasonably open to it, its decision was not supportable on the basis of its reasons. Regarding the statement that it had \"carefully reviewed all the evidence\", Justice Gibson found that such \"proclamations are simply not good enough\".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[23] In relation to the nasal conditions, the Board cites an excerpt from the medical opinion of Dr. Dempsey dated 18 January 2007 and then, without commenting on that evidence, proceeds to summarize the ERP's conclusion that there was no medical evidence to causally connect the factors associated with Mr. MacDonald's RCMP service and the development of the claimed conditions in the post discharge period. The Board then affirms the ERP decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[24] The hearing before the Board is a de novo hearing. There was new evidence before the Board that was not before the ERP. It is not apparent to me that the Board conducted its own assessment prior to affirming the decision of the ERP. Rather, it appears to have relied on the ERP assessment. Dr. Dempsey's opinion of January 18, 2007 is relevant to Mr. MacDonald's claim. Although the Board acknowledges its existence, it does not assess it. Further, it is not accurate to say that there was no evidence in Mr. MacDonald's service records relating to sinusitis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[25] The deficiency in the Board's reasons lies with the analysis proffered to support its conclusion. Sections 7 and 8 of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Regulations , SOR/96-67 (the VRAB Regulations ) require the Board to provide reasons for its decision. cautions that the concept of deference imports respect for the decision-making process of adjudicative bodies with regard to both the facts and the law. It requires a respectful attention to the reasons offered or which could be offered in support of a decision. also instructs that a court conducting a review for reasonableness \"inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes\". Reasonableness is concerned mostly with the \"existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process \". It is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law (my emphasis).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[26] The process of articulating reasons that provide justification, transparency and intelligibility for a conclusion is important because it allows for a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. The reasons must demonstrate that the submissions were considered and provide a basis for understanding why those submissions were rejected. A conclusion will not be rational or defensible if the tribunal has failed to carry out the proper analysis: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The reasons and, more specifically, the analysis in this matter fall short of that test.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[27] At the end of the day, it is for the Board, not the Court, to determine if Mr. MacDonald qualifies for a pension. These reasons do not constitute an expression of an opinion regarding the merits of Mr. MacDonald's application. They relate solely to the Board's failure to provide a rational or defensible conclusion for want of a proper analysis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[28] The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is remitted to a differently constituted Appeal Board for determination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Application allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Editor: Anick Ouellette-Levesque/vnh  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> SCHEDULE \"A <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to the Reasons for Judgment dated June 24, 2008 in JAMES MACDONALD and ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA T-1798-07  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act , R.S., 1985, c.

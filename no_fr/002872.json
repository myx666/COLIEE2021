{"id_": "002872", "body_str": ["[1] McKeown, J. : The applicant seeks judicial review of two decisions of the National Parole Board of Canada (the Board) dated February 10, 1993, and March 4, 1994, respectively. The applicant requests that this court quash firstly, the decision of the Appeal Division of the Board affirming the Board's decision to revoke the applicant's day parole and secondly, the decision of the Board denying her application for both day and full parole, in order that she be released from closed confinement subject to the provisions of the federal legislation governing conditional release. Originally, the applicant had requested an order staying the proceedings in Court File No. T-769-94B until the disposal of her judicial review application concerning Court File No. T-149-94. It was ordered by Teitelbaum, J., on July 27, 1994, in refusing the stay, that the two applications should be consolidated and heard at the same time. As such, both matters were before me at the hearing. The background facts of the two files are essentially identical, and are set out briefly below. Facts", "[2] The applicant is a 41 year old female inmate presently incarcerated in the Kingston Prison for Women, serving a life sentence for a second degree murder conviction in 1978. She was released on day parole in March 1985, and on full parole in July 1987. In October 1988 she was convicted of impaired driving causing death and leaving the scene of an accident, and in December of that year was sentenced to six years concurrent. She was again incarcerated until May 15, 1991, at which time she was granted day parole to Detweiler House, a halfway house run by the Kingston Elizabeth Fry Society. The conditions governing her parole indicated that she was prohibited, inter alia, from consuming alcohol, operating a motor vehicle and leaving the province of Ontario. After a year of conditional release, the applicant was seen by the Board in June 1992, and her day parole was extended a further six months, while full parole was denied by the Board at this time because in the applicant's words, she was not ready to be released into the community. As well, at this time, she moved from the halfway house to a satellite apartment of the Elizabeth Fry Society. Her application for full parole was to be reviewed again in January 1993.", "[3] During the 18-month period of day parole, the applicant obtained part-time employment with the Ministry of Transportation and participated regularly in group counselling for substance abuse. She also attended Tai-Chi classes, saw a psychologist for individual therapy on an as needed basis, and spent her time creating artwork which was displayed in the Kingston area.", "[4] In the course of her release on day parole, the applicant breached her condition to abstain from alcohol on two occasions. In July 1991, shortly after she was first released on day parole, she failed to return to the halfway house by the 23 h 00 curfew. She eventually returned at 23 h 38, intoxicated. She was given a stern warning and told that if such an incident reoccurred, action would be taken. The applicant again breached her parole condition to abstain from alcohol on December 24, 1992. At this time she consumed three bottles of beer while Christmas shopping. She confessed this to her supervisor and her day parole was suspended on December 29, 1992. The applicant has remained incarcerated since the time of her suspension.", "[5] It should also be noted that in early December 1992, the applicant was requested to provide urinalysis to Correctional Services officers as they had received information that she had been in a local Kingston bar with several other parolees. The applicant refused, arguing no reasonable and probable grounds were provided for the request. She was given an oral warning at the time by her parole officer about the consequences of future refusal, and later received a similar written warning dated December 17, 1992, but which was not received until December 29, 1992.", "[6] The applicant appeared before the Board for a post-suspension hearing on February 10, 1993, at which time her day parole was revoked. The applicant applied for re-examination of the Board's decision pursuant to s. 147 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act , S.C. 1992, c. 20 (the Act ). On August 4, 1993, the Appeal Division of the Board released its decision affirming the decision of the Board to revoke the applicant's parole. The applicant's case was to come before the Board again in January 1994, however, she requested that the hearing be postponed, as she was not yet ready to seek full parole. On March 4, 1994, the applicant again appeared before the Board having submitted a new release plan to it. The Board refused the applicant's request for the reinstatement of both day and full parole. This is the second decision for which judicial review is requested. I will now discuss separately the Board decisions and the relevant arguments presented by counsel with respect to each matter. The February 10, 1993 Decision", "[7] As a preliminary matter, I note that both parties agree that this court has jurisdiction to hear the application for judicial review of the February 10, 1993 decision. I note this because there is contention with respect to jurisdiction in the second matter. This will be discussed later. It is also important to note that neither of the parties raised argument with respect to the decision of the Appeal Division, rather, all argument was centred around the decision and reasons of the Board in the original revocation decision. Thus, while this matter is properly a judicial review of the decision of the Appeal Division, the argument before me was centred on the decision of the Board itself, and I have based my findings on this evidence.", "[8] At the February 10, 1993 hearing, the Board revoked the applicant's day parole. It did so on the grounds that the applicant presented an undue risk to society. In its decision the Board stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Day parole is revoked. In coming to this decision, the Board has taken into consideration several aspects of your case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Significant among these aspects are those related to your criminal history. You are serving a life sentence for an alcohol-related murder. As well, while on a previous conditional release, you drove a car while impaired by alcohol and killed a young boy. Clearly the Board in releasing you again, saw alcohol as a risk factor and imposed a related condition to abstain.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> After a significant period of time on day parole which by all accounts was viewed to that point as successful, you were observed in a drinking establishment. Subsequently, you refused to comply with the request for urinalysis made by the Area Manager, Correctional Service of Canada. Your position was supported in this regard by your direct supervisor. This support was reiterated by the indirect supervisor and relayed to the Board with a recommendation for an extension of day parole. The Board gave you the benefit of the doubt by agreeing with this request but took the opportunity to warn you. That decision expresses in very clear language that no breach of your alcohol condition would be tolerated. Seven days after that warning was issued, you consumed alcohol in a licensed establishment (the Board notes that in your presentation today you stated you were not in receipt of this decision until after the occurrence. Notwithstanding this position, the Board finds that given your tenuous position with respect to a Special Report having been submitted, it would have been even more imprudent of you to have consumed alcohol under these circumstances).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> In explaining your behaviour today, you raised two issues of concern to the Board. First, you say you were motivated by stress. The Board has considered this rationale but finds that against the backdrop of two alcohol-related offences wherein you caused death, consumption of alcohol for any reason cannot be tolerated. Second, the issue of relapse prevention was discussed. You admit that you have not and still are not, fully aware of the signs of relapse. It is the position of the Board that without a full understanding of the dynamics of relapse you are unlikely to be able to control your impulse to consume alcohol. A failure to control alcohol consumption in your case would render you an unmanageable risk in the community.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> In view of all of the above considerations, the Board is satisfied that risk has escalated beyond a point manageable on conditional release ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [9] The Board has the discretion to determine whether the applicant's parole should be revoked or her suspension cancelled. However, the decision is an administrative one and is subject to the duty of fairness. As such, it must be made in accordance with the provisions of the governing legislation and must be made on the basis of all evidence before it. In this case, the applicable legislation is Part II of the Act ; there is no dispute from counsel on this issue. Part II deals with conditional release and detention. In s. 101, the guiding principles of conditional release are set out. Section 101 reads:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 101. The principles that shall guide the Board and the provincial parole boards in achieving the purpose of conditional release are (a) that the protection of society be the paramount consideration in the determination of any case; (b) that parole boards take into consideration all available information that is relevant to a case, including the stated reasons and recommendations of the sentencing judge, any other information from the trial or the sentencing hearing, information and assessments provided by correctional authorities, and information obtained from victims and the offender; (c) that parole boards enhance their effectiveness and openness through the timely exchange of relevant information with other components of the criminal justice system and through communication of their policies and programs to offenders, victims and the general public; (d) that parole boards make the least restrictive determination consistent with the protection of society; (e) that parole boards adopt and be guided by appropriate policies and that their members be provided with the training necessary to implement those policies; and (f) that offenders be provided with relevant information, reasons for decisions and access to the review of decisions in order to ensure a fair and understandable conditional release process. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [10] Sections 100 and 102 of the Act are also relevant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 100. The purpose of conditional release is to contribute to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by means of decisions on the timing and conditions of release that will best facilitate the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the community as law-abiding citizens. . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 102. The Board or a provincial parole board may grant parole to an offender if, in its opinion, (a) the offender will not, by reoffending, present an undue risk to society before the expiration according to law of the sentence the offender is serving; and (b) the release of the offender will contribute to the protection of society by facilitating the reintegration of the offender into society as a lawabiding citizen. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [11] These general principles apply to s. 135 which also falls under Part II of the Act . Section 135 is the operative section in this particular case and reads:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 135(1) A member of the Board or a person designated by the Chairperson of the Board, when an offender breaches a condition of parole or statutory release or when the member or designated person is satisfied that it is necessary and reasonable to suspend the parole or statutory release in order to prevent a breach of any condition thereof or to protect society, may, by warrant, (a) suspend the parole or statutory release; (b) authorize the apprehension of the offender; and (c) authorize the recommitment of the offender to custody until the suspension is cancelled, the parole or statutory release is terminated or revoked or the sentence of the offender has expired according to law. . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (5) The Board shall, on the referral to it of the case of an offender serving a sentence of two years or more, review the case and, within the period prescribed by the regulations, unless the Board grants an adjournment at the offender's request, (a) cancel the suspension, where the Board is satisfied that, in view of the offender's behaviour since release, the resumption of parole or statutory release would not constitute an undue risk to society by reason of the offender reoffending before the expiration of the offender's sentence according to law; (b) where the Board is not satisfied as provided in paragraph (a), terminate the parole or statutory release of the offender if it was suspended by reason of circumstances beyond the offender's control or revoke it in any other case; or (c) where the offender is no longer eligible for the parole or statutory release, terminate or revoke it. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [12] Counsel for the applicant argued that the Board improperly ignored evidence before it that the applicant's parole supervisors, as well as counsellors at the Elizabeth Fry Society, were of the opinion that her parole should not be revoked. Their evidence indicated that her progress on day parole had been almost flawless during the past 18 months. In addition, it was stressed that the Kingston police were not opposed to the applicant's release on day parole, based on the progress summary of Correctional Services Canada dated December 10, 1992. The Kingston police department changed its view with respect to the applicant's release prior to the second hearing of March 4, 1994, however, the evidence is unclear as to when this shift in opinion occurred.", "[13] Counsel for the applicant also argued that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in relying on erroneous grounds to justify the suspension of the applicant's day parole. The Board, she contends, revoked the applicant's parole because of the political nature of the case. This will be discussed in more detail below.", "[14] The onus of establishing that the Board has failed to comply with the requirement to act reasonably or fairly lies on the applicant. I rely on the case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) in which Dubé, J., stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ... I cannot be expected to walk in the shoes of the Board members and to impose my decision upon them. In matters of judicial review and the Charter generally, the burden is upon the applicant to show that the administrative tribunal has not complied with procedural fairness or has not acted fairly or reasonably. It is not sufficient to demonstrate that the tribunal was not correct in its decisions. The applicant must establish the unreasonableness, arbitrariness or the capriciousness of the application of the legislation to his own case. . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ... It is for the Board to determine whether or not it is safe to release the applicant totally or gradually, escorted or unescorted, into the community ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [15] I am not satisfied that the applicant has met the onus in this case. The Board has the discretion to decide whether parole should be granted to a particular person. It is a specialized tribunal, the principal purpose of which is determining if the release of a particular offender would constitute an undue risk to society. The factors which the Board is to consider in making its decision are found in s. 101 of the Act , listed above. Unless the Board fails to follow these guidelines and determines a case in an arbitrary manner, or exercises its discretion in a patently unreasonable way, the court should not intervene. The Board's decision in this case was not patently unreasonable and does not warrant this court substituting its decision for that of the Board.", "[16] From the evidence, it is clear that the Board considered a number of factors when it decided to revoke the applicant's day parole, including the positive statements of the counsellors and the Correctional Services officers. In its decision, the Board indicates \"CSC(P) recommends suspension cancelled, and E. Fry Supportive\". The Board, while not elaborating on this evidence, clearly considered the positive recommendations submitted to it in making its decision. Thus, I do not agree with counsel's submission that the Board ignored this evidence. While it is clear that there were positive recommendations before it, the Board is not a rubber stamp, and may choose, despite favourable reports by Correctional Services officers, to deny or revoke parole.", "[17] Counsel also submitted that the applicant was improperly suspended for her breach of parole on December 24, 1992. She indicated that the previous breach by the applicant was far more serious than this one, yet no action was taken against her at that time. The fact that no action was taken on her first breach of parole conditions does not mean that on a subsequent breach no action can be taken if the breach is less serious. Furthermore, counsel's submissions regarding the applicant's suspension on December 29, 1992, and the circumstances surrounding it, cannot be considered because it is not the suspension decision that is under review at this time. Only one decision may be reviewed on judicial review by this court according to ss. 18.1 and 18(3) of the Federal Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended, and rule 1602(4) of the Federal Court Rules , C.R.C. 1978, c. 663, and in this case, it is the revocation decision of February 10, 1993. Counsel also submitted that the Board improperly considered the refusal of the applicant to submit to urinalysis when requested, as a negative factor in its assessment of her conduct during day parole. Counsel argued that the applicant had the right to refuse urinalysis, as the Correctional Services officers lacked reasonable and probable grounds for the request. I am of the view that counsel has misstated the test for requesting urinalysis, and I question the correctness of the applicant's refusal. Sections 55 and 56 of the Act do not require that reasonable and probable grounds be provided to the applicant. These sections read:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 55. Subject to s. 56 and subs. 57(2), a staff member, or any other person so authorized by the Service, may demand that an offender submit to urinalysis, either once or at regular intervals, in order to monitor the offender's compliance with any condition of a temporary absence, work release, parole or statutory release that requires abstention from alcohol or drugs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 56. Where a demand is made of an offender to submit to urinalysis pursuant to s. 54 or 55, the person making the demand shall forthwith inform the offender of the basis of the demand and the consequences of noncompliance. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [18] I, therefore, am of the view that counsel's submission that reasonable and probable grounds were required before the applicant need submit to urinalysis is erroneous. The legislation simply requires that the offender be told the basis for the demand, and the consequences of noncompliance. It was open to the Board to find that there was such a basis for the demand on the evidence before it. It may have been incorrect for the Board to have considered the fact that the applicant apparently ignored the Board's warning that no breach of her alcohol condition would be tolerated following her refusal to submit to urinalysis, in revoking her parole. The applicant stated in her affidavit that she did not receive this decision and warning until five days after the December 24th drinking incident. However, the Board specifically referred to this statement in its decision and found that \"given your tenuous position with respect to a special report having been submitted, it would have been even more imprudent of you to have consumed alcohol under these circumstances.\" The applicant's ignorance of the warning was one of many considerations made by the Board, and was not determinative of the matter. In light of the circumstances there is no reviewable error by the Board.", "[19] The Board also considered statements from the victim's family in making its decision. A letter was sent to the Board by the president of the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Violence, Mr. Scott Newark, on behalf of the victim's mother, indicating their opposition to the release of the applicant on parole. Such statements are permitted to be considered by the Board according to s. 101(b) of the Act . As well, Mr. Newark applied for and was granted status, to be present at the hearing on February 10, 1993, as an observer, pursuant to s. 140 of the Act", "[20] Counsel submitted that the correspondence between Mr. Newark and the Board supports her contention that the Board decided the applicant's case on the basis of the political nature of it, and not in accordance with the guidelines in the Act . Counsel also argued that the fact that Mr. Newark was at the hearing put pressure on the Board to revoke the applicant's parole, as the only reason someone from a victims' rights organization would attend a hearing, would be to make their presence known. Counsel submitted that the outcome of a hearing could easily be communicated in writing to interested parties. As a result, the very presence of any victims' rights activists is a show of power from which the Board is not immune, and such attendance is unfair to the applicant. She also indicated that the Board ignored the applicant's vehement opposition to the presence of Mr. Newark at her hearing. I note that Mr. Newark was properly granted status to attend and observe the hearing under the provisions of s. 140(4) of the Act . I also note that the objections of the applicant to his presence were considered by the Board, however, it was determined that Mr. Newark's presence would not disrupt or adversely affect the hearing. The Board fulfilled its role under the legislation.", "[21] I reiterate the above comments with respect to the submission of counsel for the applicant that the correspondence between the Board and the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Violence, as well as the presence of Mr. Newark at the hearing, resulted in the existence of a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Board members in this case. Counsel for the applicant submitted that Mr. Newark had met with the Board on previous occasions and that there were communications between his organization and the Board. Counsel for the respondent admitted that Mr. Newark had met with the executive of the Board on previous occasions, for the purposes of discussing its policies. Section 111(b) of the Act indicates that the Board is to maintain a program to communicate its policies and programs to offenders, to victims of crime, to victims' groups, to other groups and organizations with a special interest in matters dealt with under this part, and to the general public. In this respect, the Board is very much a policy oriented body. The fact that a member of a victims' rights organization met with executives of the Board, none of which in this case were sitting on the applicant's hearing, to discuss general matters of policy, does not raise a reasonable apprehension of bias. Organizations such as the John Howard and the Elizabeth Fry societies, in addition to victims' rights groups, have given input to the Board with respect to its policies. Given its very nature, such contact is insufficient to find that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists.", "[22] The Board is to be presumed to be impartial in its decision-making absent evidence to the contrary. I have found no such contrary evidence in this case. I also dismiss counsel's argument that the political nature of the case alone creates a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Board members. I agree with McGillis, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], wherein she stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ... The main argument advanced by the applicant on his application for leave and for judicial review alleges an apprehension of bias on the part of the tribunal arising from the recent attention which has been given in the media and in other areas to individuals committing criminal offences while their immigration status in this country is in question. There is no evidence before me to indicate that the tribunal may have been biased and the onus is on the applicant at this stage of the proceedings to provide such evidence. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [23] Having found there to be no reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Board members, and having found that the Board did not exercise its discretion in a patently unreasonable manner, I am of the view that this court should not interfere with the decision of the Board, but should defer to its expertise. While the applicant may be of the opinion that the Board's decision was incorrect, she has failed to meet the onus of establishing that the Board erred in law or failed to observe the principles of natural justice in coming to the decision it did.", "[24] Counsel for the applicant also argued that ss. 7 and 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Charter ) were breached. She submitted that the revocation of the applicant's parole was not made in accordance with the law, because the decision was based solely on public pressure. The applicant's liberty was implicated in a manner that was not consistent with the principles of fundamental justice. Counsel alleged that the campaigning of the victim's mother for M.A.D.D. (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) affected the Board's decision, and despite the fact that the mother has campaigned primarily in Alberta, counsel suggested that the effect of her campaigning is felt nationally. While this may be the case, there was no evidence presented to support the contention that public pressure was the basis for the Board's decision to revoke the applicant's parole. The Board found, in its opinion, that the applicant's release posed an undue risk to society. In so finding, the Board met the requirements of s. 135(5) of the Act . In my view the Board's decision did not have the effect of improperly depriving the applicant of her liberty under s. 7 of the Charter , or of imprisoning her without adherence to procedures established by law, contrary to s. 9.", "[25] The application for judicial review concerning the February 10, 1993 decision which is found in Court File No. T-149-94 is dismissed. The March 4, 1994 Decision", "[26] Counsel for the applicant submitted that this court has jurisdiction to review this particular decision, while counsel for the respondent submitted that it does not.", "[27] Counsel for the applicant argued that this court has jurisdiction to review the Board's decision, despite the fact that the applicant never appealed it to the Appeal Division of the Board, as was done with the decision of February 10, 1993. Counsel argued that it is not necessary to exhaust all internal appeal routes. She based her argument on the fact that s. 18.5 of the Federal Court Act specifically precludes judicial review where the legislation provides that an appeal lies to a court, however, it does not make any mention of internal appeals. As a result, it is not applicable in this case. She also bases her submission on the fact that the appeal provisions in the Act do not provide for review of infringements of the Charter", "[28] I agree with counsel insofar as she has indicated that s. 18.5 does not directly apply to this case. This said, it is clear from the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1979] 3 W.W.R. 676; 96 D.L.R.(3d) 14 that it is in the discretion of this court to determine whether it will hear judicial review of a decision to which s. 18.5 is not directly applicable, but for which all appeal routes have not been exhausted. While counsel for the applicant attempted to distinguish the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , from the case at hand on the basis of the complexity of the appeal routes available, I do not accept her argument. It is true that the existence of an appeal remedy does not automatically preclude certiorari, however, it is my view that in this case, the applicant should have pursued an appeal to the Appeal Division of the Board before coming to this court, as the legislation provides an adequate alternative remedy to certiorari. Section 147 of the Act clearly sets out an appeal route, the provisions of which, in my view, almost mirror the provisions of s. 18.1(4) of the Federal Court Act . Section 147 reads:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 147(1) An offender may appeal a decision of the Board to the Appeal Division on the ground that the Board, in making its decision, (a) failed to observe a principle of fundamental justice; (b) made an error of law; (c) breached or failed to apply a policy adopted pursuant to s. 151(2); (d) based its decision on erroneous or incomplete information; or (e) acted without jurisdiction or beyond its jurisdiction, or failed to exercise its jurisdiction. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [29] The purpose of having an appeal route is to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings before the court. As such, where an appeal route exists, it should, in general, be pursued to the extent that it may be, before seeking judicial review. I wish to make clear, however, that a decision may only be appealed to the extent provided for in the legislation. Judicial review may still be available for issues which may not be properly appealed.", "[30] Counsel for the applicant argued before me that the applicant should not be required to go to the Appeal Division of the Board prior to bringing an application for judicial review, on the grounds that she is unable to raise her Charter arguments at the Appeal Division. As such, she should not have to wait for the results of the internal appeal process before being able to come to this court; she should be able to argue all of her case at once. As mentioned earlier, all appeal routes should be pursued to the extent possible prior to bringing an application to this court. There is no prejudice to the applicant in requiring this, as, while it is clear that no deference will be awarded to the decisions of an administrative body regarding the Charter , the applicant is not precluded from raising Charter arguments before the Appeal Division. It should be noted, however, that I am not foreclosing the availability of judicial review should the Appeal Division refuse to hear Charter arguments.", "[31] The respondent requested his costs on this application pursuant to rule 1618 of the Federal Court Rules . The basis for his request being that the applicant has caused numerous delays to the proceedings and has sworn to information which is replete with false or misleading statements. I am of the view that there are no special reasons to order costs in this matter.", "[32] I exercise my discretion and decline jurisdiction for judicial review of the Board's decision of March 4, 1994.", "[33] The application for judicial review of Court File No. T-769-94 is dismissed. Applications dismissed. Editor: David Weir/saf [End of document]"]}

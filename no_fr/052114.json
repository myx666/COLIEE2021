{"id_": "052114", "body_str": ["[1] Teitelbaum, J. : This is an application by Frank Boahene-Agbo (the applicant) for judicial review, pursuant to s. 18.1 of the Federal Court Act , of a decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission), dated December 13, 1993, dismissing the applicant's complaint of discrimination against the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).", "[2] The applicant seeks an order setting aside the decision of the Commission, dismissing the applicant's complaint, dated July 11, 1991, against CIDA on the grounds of discrimination in employment on the basis of colour and national or ethnic origin and directing the Commission to appoint a conciliator to attempt to bring about a settlement, failing which, the matter be referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to inquire into the applicant's complaint. The applicant also seeks an order directing the Commission to examine and consider the evidence submitted by the applicant with the List of Documents and the List of Annexes, which forms part of the applicant's record.", "[3] At the hearing of the applicant's application, counsel for the applicant informed me that he now asks for different conclusions than what was mentioned in the application for judicial review. He now requests that I set aside the decision of the Commission dated December 13, 1993 and refer the matter back to the Commission with an Order that the Commission consider all the evidence. This, of course, assumes that the Commission failed to consider the evidence, or part of the evidence, that was before it. Grounds For The Application", "[4] Essentially the grounds for the application are that: a) the Commission failed to observe a principle of natural justice or procedural fairness in reaching its decision; b) the Commission based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made without regard for the materials before it; c) the Commission, and its investigator, in reaching their decision and report, acted in a manner contrary to law; d) the Commission acted outside of its jurisdiction. Background", "[5] The applicant, who is of African descent and originally from Ghana, holds M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Education from the Université de Montréal and a post-graduate diploma from the University of Ottawa in international development. He also taught English and French in Ghana. While a student at the Université de Montréal, he was employed as a French language instructor by the Public Service Commission (the PSC) between 1987 and 1990.", "[6] On February 12, 1990, the applicant was hired under the Public Service Commission Visible Minorities Program, as an indeterminate employee, with a one year probationary period. The applicant's position was a program manager at the PM-4 level with CIDA. Specifically, he was involved with managing the Family and Publication Program of the Briefing Centre at CIDA. The Briefing Centre provides briefings to people working for CIDA and their families. The applicant's employment was made pursuant to an agreement between the applicant, CIDA and the PSC (the agreement). Under the terms of the agreement, the appointment was an indeterminate training appointment, wherein the PSC agreed to reimburse CIDA for salary, a person year and for non-salary costs covering two workshops held in Africa. In return, CIDA agreed to provide on the job training and to \"continue the [applicant's] employment in the same indeterminate position or in a similar position at the level of the target classification, upon satisfactory completion of the training period\". The assignment training period was from February 12, 1990 to July 31, 1990.", "[7] According to the applicant, at best he received a total of seven days of training within the specific training period of February 12, 1990 to July 31, 1990. He states the training plan was not implemented within the training period ending on July 31, 1990. The applicant was also allowed to attend, on August 14, 1990, a one day training session on supervision.", "[8] The applicant indicated that he was assigned a work station separate and distant from the supervisor and his colleagues; told to determine what his predecessor did and continue from there (the applicant did not receive a copy of his job description until January 1991) and that it was time to sink or swim. The applicant was of the view that no assistance was given to him to enable him to familiarize himself with his duties.", "[9] The applicant's first performance appraisal was prepared by his supervisor, Mr. Gabriel Dicaire (Dicaire) in August of 1990. The appraisal noted that the application had met most of the objectives satisfactorily, but required improvement in three areas: he had to demonstrate he had sufficient linguistic capability in French for the position; substantially improve his administrative skills and ask for less supervision and become more operational.", "[10] On January 22, 1991, the applicant was called away from a training course to a meeting with his supervisor and the director. At this meeting, the applicant was informed of his failure to achieve the objectives listed on the first appraisal and of the decision to reject him on probation. The applicant was given his second performance appraisal on January 23, 1991. The second appraisal stated that the applicant needed constant supervision when formulating and working on administrative tasks because of administrative knowledge which he lacked and because his working style and previous career were not suited to bureaucratic work. The appraisal also noted that the applicant relied too much on consultants, had difficulty integrating himself into the team and had not developed leadership regarding the consultants or the clerk he supervised. The supervisor noted that the applicant had good knowledge regarding research, languages and other areas but did not have an opportunity to demonstrate this in his job. The supervisor concluded that in comparison with others he supervised, who had taken three months to reach full speed, the applicant's performance was barely satisfactory. The applicant signed the appraisal but added that he completely disagreed with the contents.", "[11] On February 5, 1991, Mr. Vern Johnson (Johnson), the PSC Minority Program Officer, the applicant's supervisor Dicaire, Lynda Whyte (Whyte) the CIDA Employment Equity Officer, and the applicant met at the PSC offices to review the basis of the applicant's rejection on probation. From notes taken at the meeting, it appears that Dicaire had difficulty substantiating the allegations in the evaluation, for example he failed to provide specific examples where the applicant had failed in his tasks. It was the opinion of Johnson and Whyte that the supervisor had not provided enough guidance and training and should reconsider his decision to reject the applicant on probation and offer assistance in designing a training plan for the applicant.", "[12] Soon after, the applicant's supervisor, Dicaire, wrote to the Vice President, Professional Services of CIDA, recommending the applicant be rejected on probation. On February 6, 1991, the Vice President had informed the Director General of Personnel of the decision and on February 8, 1991, the Director General of Personnel wrote to the applicant, informing him that he had been rejected on probation, effective March 8, 1991, because he had not demonstrated the required ability to carry out the functions of the Family Program and Publications Manager position. The applicant is of the belief that he was released, by Dicaire, because Dicaire was practising discrimination, that is, because the applicant is black.", "[13] The applicant filed a grievance against his final performance appraisal, his rejection on probation, abuse of authority, personal harassment and his statement of duties. The applicant's grievance was denied at the final level by the Vice President of CIDA in a letter dated May 24, 1991.", "[14] On July 11, 1991, the applicant filed a complaint with the Commission, which was numbered H 32280. The applicant indicated that CIDA had discriminated against him by treating him in \"an adverse differential manner during the course of employment and by refusing to employ me because of my colour and national or ethnic origin in violation of s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act\". The applicant outlined his complaint in the following terms: \"I was employed by CIDA in February 1990. I tried to negotiate my starting salary but my boss, M. Gabriel Dicaire, told me that I came from the Visible Minority Employment Program, that he had no choice but to employ me and that if I was not satisfied with the salary to go somewhere else. \"When I started working, the desk I was assigned to was on the 8th floor while my colleagues worked on the 4th floor. I was left alone most of the time with little, if any, training and guidance. \"In April 1990, my supervisor asked me for my schedule of work for the year. I told him it was difficult for me because I didn't know what my job was yet and neither did I know the role and objectives of the department. Nevertheless, I submitted a plan that was approved by him. \"On January 22, 1991, I was at a training course in Ottawa when I received a phone call from my supervisor asking me to come back to the office for a meeting. It was at that point that I learned of the dissatisfaction of my supervisor and manager concerning my work. On January 23, 1991, I was given a performance evaluation recommending that I be rejected during my probation period.\"", "[15] By letter dated July 23, 1991, addressed to CIDA and copied to the applicant, the applicant and CIDA were advised that Diane Chamaillard (Chamaillard) was designated under s. 43 of the Canadian Human Rights Act to investigate the applicant's complaint. Between May 1991 and May 1992, Chamaillard was the intake officer in this matter and as such collected details of the complaint from the applicant, assisted the applicant in preparing his complaint form, received a copy of CIDA's initial response to the complaint and corresponded with the applicant.", "[16] On May 15, 1992, the applicant and CIDA were informed that the applicant's complaint had been transferred from the Regional Office to the Commission Headquarters as part of the Complaints Clearance Project (the Project) and that the new investigator was Michael McMahon (McMahon) of the Pass Group. According to the respondent, the Project was undertaken between May of 1992 and the fall of 1993, and was designed to reduce the backlog of human rights complaints filed with the Commission and at the same time provide for fair and thorough investigations into those complaints. The Pass Group was one of the private consulting firms to whom the Commission contracted investigations in the Project. According to the affidavit of Anne Rooke (at the time, Manager of the Complaints Clearance Project), the Commission trained the investigators used by the Pass Group and provided the Pass Group with an investigation plan respecting the applicant's complaint, together with the Commission's file to record the results of the investigation.", "[17] According to the applicant, he never met or spoke with McMahon. However, in the fall of 1992, the applicant was advised that Mr. Mark Lenihan (Lenihan), also of the Pass Group, would be the investigator. The applicant was subsequently interviewed by Lenihan. According to the Rooke affidavit, Lenihan had carriage of the applicant's complaint from the fall of 1992 to March of 1993 and provided Rooke with a draft investigation report.", "[18] The applicant wrote an open letter to the Commission in April 1993, complaining about the delay of the investigation. A copy of this letter was published in the Ottawa Citizen", "[19] On April 21, 1993, the applicant and CIDA were advised that a new investigator, Cleo Gubbels (Gubbels) was appointed to handle the applicant's complaint. Although Gubbels had initially taken carriage of the applicant's complaint, she was subsequently retained by the Commission as an independent investigator to conduct a further investigation into the complaint. Gubbels interviewed the applicant by telephone on March 27 and April 17, 1993 and interviewed Yvon Chabot of CIDA on March 22, March 30 and April 5, 1993 (for interview notes, see Exhibit G of the Rooke affidavit).", "[20] In May 1993, Joan Bishop (Bishop), a Senior Compliance Officer with the Commission took carriage of the investigation from Gubbels. Bishop conducted further interviews relating to the applicant's complaint. Bishop's notes of interviews and letters are contained in Exhibit H to the Rooke affidavit and includes notes of the following: - interview with Roger Roome, employee of CIDA, located on the same floor as the applicant; - letter to and reply from Rames, Abhukara, who worked in the Briefing Centre in 1990; - telephone interview with Lynda White, an employment equity officer at CIDA; - interview with applicant; - interview with Mamadou Faye, consultant; - interview with Claire Trepanier, co-worker at the Briefing Centre; - telephone interview with Micheline Beaudouin, secretary to Dicaire; - handwritten notes of interviews with Paul Hitschfeld, Director; Danielle Wetherup, part of the appeal process; and Dicaire, applicant's supervisor.", "[21] Following the investigation, a report was prepared dated June 25, 1993, recommending that the complaint be dismissed because, on the evidence, the applicant's allegations were unfounded. The report outlined the applicant's complaint and CIDA's evidence including comments regarding the Briefing Centre, Public Service Visible Minority Program, Starting Salary, Location of Work Stations, Training, Job Description, Job Performance, Rejection on Probation, Efforts to Find Another Position, Other Related Evidence and Conclusion and Recommendation. The Conclusion and Recommendation portion of the Report is reproduced below: \"82. The evidence shows that the complainant's starting salary was calculated according to the standard regulations for all employees. Because there were no witnesses, there is no evidence to indicate whether the supervisor told the complainant he had no choice but to hire him and that if he didn't like it he could go elsewhere. \"83. The evidence indicates that the complainant's location on a different floor from the supervisor and co-workers was due to space restrictions and did not play a significant role in his rejection on probation. His immediate predecessor and Consultant 1 who had done part of his job had also been located there. \"84. The evidence indicates that the supervisor did not follow the training plan in the Agreement between the respondent and the PSC, but did meet occasionally with the complainant to discuss his work. Of the formal courses offered to the complainant, two were courses offered to all new employees, and none related directly to the administrative skills which were identified by the supervisor as being weak. There is little evidence that the supervisor or anyone else provided detailed on-the-job training. The evidence also indicates that, although Consultant 1 provided some briefing to the complainant, he had no official training role and did not cover all aspects of the job. \"85. The evidence indicates that the complainant did not receive a job description until January 1991, nearly eleven months after he began working for the respondent. He prepared a list of objectives for his supervisor in April 1990. \"86. The only witness who stated he had heard the supervisor make racist comments was Consultant 1. His evidence was contradicted by the documentation clerk, the secretary and a former employee who is black and from Africa. The former employee said that although he had not heard the supervisor make racist remarks sometimes he may have shaded meanings in that direction without being aware of the implications. Consultant 2, who is also black and from Africa, said that he had not heard the supervisor make racist comments. The other co-workers said they had never heard the supervisor make racist comments. \"87. The evidence indicates that the supervisor recommended that the complainant be rejected on probation. The PSC Program Officer and the respondent's Employment Equity Officer recommended that he reconsider, but he declined after consulting the Director and a Staffing Officer. There is little evidence that the respondent made an effort to find another position for the complainant. \"88. Therefore, it is recommended that the complaint be dismissed because, on the evidence, the allegations are unfounded.\"", "[22] The applicant filed an extensive written response, dated August 4, 1993, which included a List of Documents, a List of Exhibits and a binder of over 580 pages of material. The applicant's written response and the materials contained in the Binder are attached as Exhibits 1 to 8 and 10 to 23 of the applicant's affidavit. The applicant indicated that he prepared a detailed and documented analysis to what he described as the inadequate, and generally poor, investigation made by the Commission. The applicant indicated that the investigator did not address the issues of his complaint, namely: \"was the complainant given appropriate and/or specific training to perform satisfactorily in the position; was the complainant given adequate guidance and supervision; did the complainant show initiative and leadership in the position; and were there any incidents which could be interpreted as discriminatory, harassment or abuse of authority. The applicant also described the report as \"nothing but a collection of comments from co-workers who have nothing to do with the complaint and the issues raised. The Report is full of unsubstantiated allegations. Allegations cannot and ought not be substituted for facts\".", "[23] Following receipt of the applicant's written response, Bishop conducted further investigations into the applicant's complaint. Bishop interviewed Norman Cook (Cook) on October 4, 1993. Although Cook worked at CIDA, he did not work with the applicant. Cook stated that he (Cook) knew the applicant as Cook chaired the Minorities Committee at CIDA and the applicant was a member of this Committee. Cook also stated that the applicant's predecessor, Rames Abhukara made the same complaints about the supervisor as the applicant, namely that the supervisor was paternalistic and that Abhurkara was not given responsibilities of his level and was over supervised. Bishop also had a telephone conversation with Yvon Chabot on October 5, 1993, regarding any complaint made by Abhukara and was advised that no formal complaint had been made.", "[24] On October 6, 1993, Bishop signed a second investigation report, which recommended that a conciliator be appointed to attempt to bring about a settlement of the applicant's complaint.", "[25] On November 5, 1993, CIDA provided the Commission with a written response to the second investigation report. This response is attached as Exhibit N to the Rooke affidavit.", "[26] On November 8, 1993, the applicant replied to the revised report and requested that his initial response together with supporting documentation be submitted to the Commission for review. This reply is attached as Exhibit 21 to the applicant's affidavit.", "[27] The applicant's complaint was considered by the Commission at its meeting of December 6, 1993. At that time, the Commission had before it the following material: 1) summary of background to investigation; 2) investigation report dated October 10, 1993; 3) applicant's complaint form, dated July 11, 1991; 4) applicant's written response dated November 8, 1993 to report dated October 10, 1993; 5) applicant's written response dated August 4, 1993 to report dated June 25, 1993, with list of exhibits; 6) CIDA's written response dated November 5, 1993 to report dated October 10, 1993; 7) investigation report dated June 25, 1993; 8) chronology of applicant's complaint.", "[28] According to the respondent, the binder of the applicant's material was also available to the Commissioners if they wished to consult it. According to the applicant, a List of Documents and a List of Annexes, the documents in both Lists and the applicant's response dated August 4, 1993, were submitted to the Commission in respect to his complaint. However, only the List of Documents and the List of Annexes and his response, but not the actual documents supplied, were considered by the Commission in reaching its decision of December 6, 1993. The List of Documents, the List of Annexes, and the documents referred to in the List of Annexes are attached as Exhibit 23 of the applicant's affidavit.", "[29] By letter dated December 13, 1993, the Commission advised the applicant that: \"The Commission has decided that, considering all the circumstances of the complaint, no further proceedings are warranted. \"Accordingly, the Commission has closed the file.\"", "[30] In response to the applicant's request to the Commission pursuant to the Access to Information Act , for access to his file, the Commission wrote the applicant a letter dated March 28, 1994, describing its meeting on December 6, 1993 and enclosing the agenda and summary of staff recommendations.", "[31] The applicant has attacked the Commission's decision in three main areas, namely the adequacy of the investigation, the adequacy of the Commissioners' actions and decision and that the Commission acted outside its jurisdiction.", "[32] With regard to the first head of attack, the applicant submits that the investigation conducted by the Commission was inadequate in the following respects: 1) the investigator had no understanding of the context in which the discrimination complained of took place; 2) the extensive evidence provided by the applicant was ignored or not given enough weight, but the response of the respondents, which were mere unsubstantiated statements, was accepted; 3) the changes in investigators impaired the continuity and adequacy of the investigation.", "[33] In view of these errors, the applicant maintains that the Commission erred in relying on the Investigation Report and the materials before it in making its decision, dated December 13, 1993. The applicant argues that by relying on the Investigation Report, the Commission breached the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness, erred in law in making its decision on erroneous findings of fact and acted contrary to law.", "[34] The applicant submits that the investigators failed to understand the terms of the PSC Employment Equity Program, namely, as a technique to increase the representation of visible minorities in the Public Service and that a major component of his program was the training of such employees for a period of time to become qualified to assume the permanent appointment for which they were being trained. The investigators, according to the applicant, treated the matter as a mere probation in the normal sense.", "[35] In the case at bar, the applicant's appointment under the Visible Minority Employment Program of the PSC involved a 12 month probationary period. Further, under the terms of the appointment, the 12 month probation period would include a training period of approximately six months, from February 12, 1990 to July 31, 1990, and the balance of the period was for the applicant to demonstrate his knowledge, skill and suitability for the position. Also, under the terms of the agreement, CIDA was responsible for evaluating the applicant's progress pursuant to the training plan against the expected training accomplishments specified in the training plan.", "[36] The applicant maintains that the evidence clearly shows that: 1) CIDA and the PSC did not provide the applicant with a job description (it should be noted that the applicant eventually received a job description in January 1991); 2) the supervisor did not provide the applicant with his initial work plan and he was asked to present one upon arrival at CIDA without knowing what the projects and priorities were; 3) the supervisor did not meet formally every week and later monthly with the applicant as outlined in the training plan; 4) other than sporadic courses, no systematic training plan was ever adopted.", "[37] The applicant also maintains that the investigation report failed to deal with the training plan and objectives, the accomplishments against which the applicant was to be evaluated and the formal contacts that the supervisor had to undertake. The applicant contends that the investigation report erroneously stated that CIDA agreed to \"provide on-the-job training through the initial indeterminate appointment from February 19, 1990 to April 19, 1991\" and made a cursory statement on the courses taken and the events surrounding the on-the-job training.", "[38] The applicant submits that the investigation report overlooked the importance of the training plan in the context of the Visible Minority Employment Program, compared to a mere on-the-job training, and that the period of training was not from February 19, 1990 to April 19, 1990, but from February 12, 1990 to July 31, 1990.", "[39] The applicant asserts that other than the interview with Lenihan, none of the investigators, including Gubbels, interviewed the applicant. The applicant states that the most Gubbels did was to speak with the applicant by telephone (However, it should be noted that Gubbels spoke to the applicant twice by telephone on March 27 and April 17, 1993 and that Bishop interviewed the applicant on May 26, 1993).", "[40] The applicant also asserts that the investigators accepted the unsubstantiated statements of CIDA employees and the applicant's co-workers. The applicant argues that in a situation, as in the case at bar, where the discrimination occurs by way of person-to-person contact or actions taken in writing (the appraisal), the challenge to the investigator is to go beyond the usual denials of the respondent and to require the respondent and others to produce evidence to support the actions taken. The applicant maintains that no such requirement was made by the investigators in this case.", "[41] The applicant argues that the investigator did not give any weight to the evidence of Johnson (the PSC Visible Minority Program official) and Whyte (CIDA's Employment Equity Officer), whose opinion was that the supervisor's rejection of the applicant's probation was unjustified. The applicant also notes that the general evidence of the unfavourable recruitment of CIDA to employ visible minorities, referred to by the investigator, did not register any weight towards the conclusions in the investigator's report. Neither was the evidence, as found by the investigator, that CIDA failed to make any effort to find a position for the applicant within CIDA, taken to lend support for the applicant's complaint.", "[42] The applicant maintains the evidence that the applicant was isolated and unsupervised for nine months (thereby putting CIDA in breach of the PSC Agreement) and still accomplished substantial operational work, mostly between February and August 1990, within the Briefing Centre was ignored in the determination of whether the supervisor's decision to reject to applicant's probation could be supported or was racially motivated.", "[43] The applicant also referred to the evidence of a witness who told the investigator that the applicant received no training in his own office during the first six months, but could not say whether the supervisor provided training elsewhere, and the fact that the investigator did not see fit to determine whether the supervisor had provided training elsewhere.", "[44] In terms of the adequacy or more appropriately the inadequacy of the Commissioners' action and decision, the applicant makes the following submissions: 1) the Commission failed to consider the evidence filed by the applicant; 2) the Commission did not adequately inform itself of the evidence and its consideration of the complaint was superficial; 3) the Commission failed to undertake satisfactory investigation by appointing three successive investigators, resulting in an inordinate delay; 4) the Commission acted without impartiality caused by the applicant's public complaint of the inordinate delay of its investigation; 5) the Commission acted unreasonably in rejecting the recommendations of its investigator to appoint a conciliator.", "[45] The applicant maintains that the evidence indicates the documents that were forwarded to this court under cover of the Commission's letter dated February 23, 1994, were the materials submitted to the Commissioners to arrive at their decision, dated December 6, 1993. According to the applicant, the documents did not include actual documents included in the List of Documents and List of Annexes appended to the applicant's letter dated August 4, 1993, to the Commission containing his comments of the Investigator's report.", "[46] The applicant submits that the Commission, without having considered the documents, in the absence of clear evidence that the investigator considered these documents, made its decision in total disregard of the record before it. The documents enumerated on the List of Annexes alone, which records some of the actual work done by the applicant during his tenure with CIDA, consists of 396 pages and argues the applicant, would have been physically impossible for both the investigator and the Commission to make a defensible and rational decision without looking at these documents. The applicant further submits that it would have been difficult to reach such a decision without examining, however cursorily, the documents included in the List of Documents, which stakes out the lack of training and instruction of the applicant and describes the work atmosphere and conditions at the Briefing Centre.", "[47] The applicant notes that according to the evidence, the Commissioners received their material on November 25, 1993, for a meeting to be held on December 6, 1993, which included travel time allowed, eleven days to study 2,159 pages and 146 cases. On the actual day of decision, assuming the Commission followed strictly its agenda, the Commission spent three hours and 25 minutes to decide upon 146 cases, thereby giving each case no more than one minute and four seconds on average.", "[48] In light of the above, the applicant asserts that the Commission could not have properly considered the cases at the meeting of December 6, 1993. To consider alone the point of whether there is a basis to appoint a conciliator, as recommended by the investigator, would have taken more time. The applicant states that it would have been necessary, at least, for the Commissioners to examine the basis for such recommendation and the relevant considerations supporting its rejection.", "[49] The applicant also asserts that the Commission's actions of assigning two internal investigators and a private firm of external investigators, could only have had the effect of producing a confused and inadequate investigation.", "[50] The applicant maintains that this manner of proceeding with the complaint could not have any effect but to prejudice the quality of both the investigation and the decision, and as such, the Commission breached the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness.", "[51] The applicant also maintains that the Commissioner's decision to reject the recommendation of the investigator to appoint a conciliator and then dismiss the complaint, was at least in part, influenced (although the applicant concedes there is no direct evidence on this) by the applicant's letter, written to the Chief Commissioner and subsequently published in the Ottawa Citizen . This letter referred to the Commissioner's statement to the Ottawa Citizen that the men (including the applicant) will face a longer period for seeking a remedy before the courts in relation to another case rather than before the Commission. The Chief Commissioner was reported to have said: \"Current cases before the Human Rights Commission are being handled within nine months\". The applicant disputed the accuracy of this statement in his letter, when he indicated that whereas his case had been before the courts for 18 months, the investigation by the Commission \"continues, after 22 months to stumble, grope and choke with it\".", "[52] The applicant submits that the Commission had no reasonable grounds to reject the investigator's recommendation to appoint a conciliator.", "[53] With regard to the issue of jurisdiction of the Commission and whether or not the Commission acted outside its jurisdiction, the applicant submits that the Commission acted without jurisdiction, in that the Commission misconceived its true function, that is, being an investigative body and therefore its true function is to gather evidence not to weigh the evidence. Counsel submits that the true function of the Commission is only to decide if it, the Commission, has gathered enough evidence to warrant \"going to the next stage\". It is submitted that the Commission has no jurisdiction to weigh the evidence before it in order to come to any conclusion that further proceedings are warranted. Counsel submits that the Commission, in making the decision of whether \"to go to the next stage\" must do so pursuant to the Act and under the Canadian Human Rights Act CHRA ). It is not necessary at the Commission stage \"that the evidence is evidence in the context of the law of evidence\" but that \"information\", not necessarily evidence would be sufficient for consideration by the Commission.", "[54] Counsel submits, therefore, that the threshold is less than what the Commission required in the present case and gives as authority for the above submission the decision of Mr. Justice Sopinka in the case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 385.", "[55] Furthermore, the applicant submits that an investigating body, the Commission, and a quasi-judicial body (the tribunal) exercise different functions, that is, the tribunal would engage in an intellectual exercise while the Commission is not permitted to do so as it is only permitted to gather facts \"information\" in order to determine \"if what it has before it [I assume the facts and information] is evidence that could be placed before a tribunal\", \"the Commission cannot make a decision as to weight\".", "[56] The applicant submits that because the Commission failed to examine an important part of the evidence, it acted outside of its jurisdiction in deciding there is insufficient evidence to \"forward the case to the next stage\". He submits that the Commission erred in two ways, it failed to direct its mind to its investigatory function rather than a quasi-judicial function in determining the validity of the complaint and the Commission, the manner it decided to not accept the applicant's complaint failed to look at what the investigator put before it to determine if there was any evidence upon which a tribunal may act and not to determine the weight of the evidence to determine whether to order the matter to proceed before a tribunal.", "[57] The respondent's position is essentially that the Commission did not commit any reviewable error in dismissing the applicant's complaint under s. 44(3)(b)(i) of the Canadian Human Rights Act . Moreover, the Commission did not err in the manner in which it conducted its investigation.", "[58] The respondent notes that the applicant is attempting to impugn the investigation based primarily upon the manner in which the investigators evaluated and interpreted the information available in the case, and is therefore alleging that the Commission in relying on these reports, based its decision upon erroneous findings of fact. The respondent also notes that in order to set a decision aside on the basis of an erroneous finding of fact, the court must be satisfied that the finding is truly erroneous; the finding was made capriciously or without regard to the evidence and the decision was based upon the erroneous finding. The respondent maintains that the court is not justified in intervening simply because the facts could have been inquired into more thoroughly or differently.", "[59] With respect to the case at bar, the respondent submits that the Commission did not commit any reviewable errors in its treatment of the facts. The respondent maintains that the investigation reports are themselves evidence that the investigation was a thorough and unbiased one undertaken with a clear understanding of the nature of the complaint, and that the applicant's submissions amount to a disagreement with the investigators as to what information should have been analyzed and the weight and interpretation to be afforded to certain evidence.", "[60] The respondent argues that the alleged \"inadequacies\" raised by the applicant relate to areas which were examined by the investigator and were discussed in the investigator's report. Moreover, the applicant submitted comments on both of the reports in which he pointed out inadequacies which he submitted existed, additional investigations were conducted following the first report and the two investigation reports and the applicant's submissions were before the Commission when it made its decision. As such, the respondent maintains that there is no evidence that the investigation produced any erroneous finding of fact, and therefore the Commission did not err in considering the reports in making its final decision.", "[61] In response to the applicant's allegation that the Commission failed to observe a principle of natural justice, procedural fairness or other procedure it was required by law to observe, because more than one investigator was involved in investigating the applicant's complaint and because some of the investigators did not interview the applicant, the respondent submits that the fact that more than one investigator was involved in the investigation does not constitute a reviewable error. The respondent argues that the role of the investigators in human rights complaint proceedings is an example of the principle that applies to all administrative tribunals that they do not have to do all the work themselves, but may delegate some of the work to others. The respondent also argues that it is in the discretion of the Commission to delegate such work as it sees fit for the proper and efficient conduct of its mandate. The respondent further submits that there is no evidence that the involvement of the investigators in the case at bar had any detrimental effect upon the merit or adequacy of the investigation into the applicant's complaint. The respondent submits that, to the contrary, the investigation appears to have been conducted more thoroughly and more quickly as a result of the involvement of additional investigators.", "[62] The respondent maintains that it is clear from the evidence and the applicant's own admissions that the applicant was interviewed on at least two occasions, which included an interview with the investigator who prepared the two investigation reports. Moreover, argues the respondent, the applicant was provided with full, fair and effective opportunities to make written submissions to the Commission in respect of his complaint, and there is no evidence that the fact that the applicant may not have spoken to all of those involved in the investigation affected the merits of the investigation.", "[63] The respondent maintains that the Commission did not err in concluding that no further proceedings were warranted in respect of the applicant's complaint.", "[64] The respondent submits that the Commission is not required to consider all of the material which was gathered in the course of the investigation in making its decision, but rather may consider the investigator's report, the parties' representations and such underlying material as it, in its discretion, considers necessary. The Commission is not bound by the opinion or findings of the investigator, but rather must make its own decision based upon the material which it, in its discretion, considers necessary. The respondent argues that this is precisely what the Commission did in this case, and there is no evidence that the Commission committed a reviewable error in so doing. The respondent adds that the Commission's decision is an administrative one, and is not required to be made on a judicial or quasi-judicial basis.", "[65] Further, by virtue of s. 44(3)(b)(i) of the Act , the Commission is required to dismiss a complaint where it is satisfied that \"having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is not warranted\". In making this determination, asserts the respondent, the Commission need not weigh the evidence as in a judicial proceeding but rather must decide whether there is a reasonable basis in evidence for proceeding to the next step.", "[66] The respondent maintains that the applicant has failed to establish that the Commission members did not adequately review the material before them in making their decision, particularly considering the Commission members received the information regarding the applicant's complaint on November 25, 1993, 11 days prior to the date upon which the decision in the applicant's case was rendered. Moreover, as noted above, the Commission is not bound by the findings of the investigator, but is required to come to its own decision based upon the information which it considers necessary in making its decision. The respondent argues that a review of the materials considered by the Commission indicates that the Commissioner's decision was not perverse, but rather a reasonable one in the circumstances.", "[67] In response to the applicant's contention regarding the delay in investigating the applicant's complaint, the respondent submits that the time taken to investigate and report on the applicant's complaint, approximately 24 months was not inordinate and unreasonable. The respondent argues that there is no evidence that the Commission failed to perform its investigation in good faith, and the investigation reports indicate that a thorough and fair review of the applicant's complaint was undertaken. Further, the respondent maintains there is no evidence that the applicant was in any way prejudiced by the length of time taken by the Commission to make a determination on his complaint.", "[68] The respondent submits that there is no evidence to support the applicant's assertion that the Commission's decision was influenced in any way by the applicant's letter which was published in the Ottawa Citizen on April 14, 1993.", "[69] With regard to the applicant's submission on the issue of jurisdiction of the Commission, the respondent submits that the Commission, in making a decision, is making a statutory review decision. Counsel submits that the Commission in arriving at a decision, is dealing with conflicting evidence and therefore by its very nature requires an analysis of the conflicting evidence, it requires a \"weighing\" of the evidence. Respondent submits that the Commission \"is master of its own house\", its obligation is to collect relevant information through its investigators, to give both sides the right to make representations and then to exercise its statutory decision. It need not make a detailed review of the evidence before it. Discussion", "[70] I have reproduced a number of provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended, (the Act ), relevant to my review: \"2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada and to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that every individual should have an equal opportunity with other individuals to make for himself or herself the life that he or she is able and wished to have, consistent with his or her duties and obligations as a member of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon had been granted. \"3(1) For all purposes of this Act, race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted are prohibited grounds of discrimination. \"7. It is discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, (a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or (b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. \"10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or organization of employers (a) to establish or pursue a policy of practice, or (b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment, that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination. \"40(1) Subject to subs. (5) and (7), any individual or group of individuals having reasonable grounds for believing that a person is engaged or has engaged in discriminatory practice may file with the Commission a complaint in a form acceptable to the Commission. \"41. Subject to s. 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that (a) the alleged victim of the discriminatory practice to which the complaint related ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available; (b) the complaint is one that could be more appropriately dealt with, initially or completely, according to a procedure provided for under an Act of Parliament other than this Act; (c) the complaint is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission; (d) the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith; or (e) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint. \"43(1) The Commission may designate a person, in this Part referred to an 'investigation', to investigate a complaint. \"43(2) An investigator shall investigate a complaint in a manner authorized by regulations made pursuant to subs. (4). \"44(1) An investigator shall, as soon as possible after the conclusion of an investigation, submit to the Commission a report of the findings of the investigation. \"44(2) If, on the receipt of a report referred to in subs. (1), the Commission is satisfied (a) that the complainant ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available, or (b) that the complaint could more appropriately be dealt with, initially or completely, by means of a procedure provided for under an Act of Parliament other than this Act it shall refer the complainant to the appropriate authority. \"44(3) On receipt of a report referred to in subs. (1), the Commission (a) may request the President of the Human Rights Tribunal Panel to appoint a Human Rights Tribunal in accordance with s. 49 to inquire into the complaint to which the report relates if the Commission is satisfied (i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is warranted, and (ii) that the complaint to which the report relates should not be referred pursuant to subs. (2) or dismissed on any ground mentioned in paragraphs 41(c) to (e); or (b) shall dismiss the complaint to which the report relates if it is satisfied (i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is not warranted, or (ii) that the complaint should be dismissed on any ground mentioned in paragraphs 41(c) to (e). \"44(4) After receipt of a report referred to in subs. (1), the Commission (a) shall notify in writing the complainant and the person against whom the complaint was made of its actions under sub. (2) and (3); and (b) may, in such manner as it sees fit, notify any other person whom it considers necessary to notify under sub. (2) or (3).\"", "[71] Therefore, under the Act , where an individual having reasonable grounds for believing that a discriminatory practice is or has occurred, files a complaint in acceptable form, the Commission is required to deal with the complaint unless it appears to the Commission that the complaint falls within one of the exceptions set out in s. 41. Where the complaint is not rejected under s. 41, there are three possible ways to proceed with the complaint, namely; the Commission may appoint an investigator under s. 43 to investigate the complaint, appoint a conciliator under s. 47 to attempt to settle the complaint, or request the President of the Human Rights Tribunal under s. 49 to appoint a Tribunal to inquire into the complaint. If the investigation route is chosen, the complaint enters the investigation stage. As noted by Nadon, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 22: \"I note that investigators, the CHRC and reviewing courts are essentially without legislative guidance regarding the conduct of investigations. Section 43 of the Act empowers investigators with search and seizure abilities but sets no minimum duties of investigation. Furthermore, except in the limited domains of investigations pertaining to matters of immigration and customs and excise, no investigation regulations have been created despite the provision under s. 44(4) of the Act for the Governor-in-Council, inter alia, to make regulations prescribing the procedures to be followed by investigators.\"", "[72] Where an investigator is appointed, he/she is charged with investigating the complaint and submitting to the Commission a report of the relevant facts and his/her conclusions. The position of the investigator in relation to the Commission was described in the following terms by Sopinka, J., (writing for the majority) in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at p. 898: \"The investigator, in conducting the investigation, does so as an extension of the Commission. I do not regard the investigator as someone independent of the Commission who will then present evidence as a witness before the Commission. Rather, the investigator prepares a report for the Commission. This is merely an example of the principle that applies to administrative tribunals, that they do not have to do all the work themselves but may delegate some of it to others. Although s. 36 [currently s. 44] does not require that a copy of the report be submitted to the parties, that was done in this case.\"", "[73] Upon receipt of the investigation report, the Commission may: refer the complaint to a more appropriate authority (s. 44(2)); request the appointment of a tribunal if it is satisfied that, having regard to all of the circumstances, an inquiry into the complaint is warranted (s. 44(3)); or dismiss the complaint.", "[74] Sopinka, J., indicated at p. 899 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, that it was the intention of s. 36(3)(b) (currently s. 44(3)(b)(i)), that a complaint be dismissed where there is insufficient evidence to warrant appointment of a tribunal under s. 39, (currently s. 49). He continued to describe the process: \"... It is not intended that this be a determination where the evidence is weighed as in a judicial proceeding but rather the Commission must determine whether there is a reasonable basis in the evidence for proceeding to the next stage. It was not intended that there be a formal hearing from the investigatory stage to the judicial or quasi-judicial stage if the test prescribed in s. 36(3)(a) [currently paragraph 44(3)(a)] is met. Accordingly, I conclude from the foregoing that, in view of the nature of the Commission's function and giving effect to the statutory provisions referred to, it was not intended that the Commission comply with the formal rules of natural justice. In accordance with the principles of procedural fairness in Nicholson , supra, however, I would supplement the statutory provisions by requiring the Commission to comply with the rules of procedural fairness. In this regard, I adopt the statement of Lord Denning, M.R., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the nature or the classification of the Commission's decision, as noted by Sopinka, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, the distinction between tribunals exercising their functions in an \"administrative\" manner as opposed to a \"judicial\" or \"quasi-judicial\" manner, in order to determine whether the rules of natural justice apply is no longer critical or determinative. \"Rather, a general duty of 'procedural fairness' is to be applied to all administrative decision making processes, the content of which varies according to the circumstances of the particular instance\", ( Slattery , supra), p. 16.", "[76] Sopinka, J., at p. 902 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, agreed with Marceau, J.A., of the Federal Court of Appeal, that the Commission had a duty to inform the parties of the substance of the evidence obtained by the investigator and which was put before the Commission. The Commission was also required to give the parties the opportunity to respond to this evidence and make all relevant representations in relation thereto. In the case before me, there is no allegation that the applicant was not given the opportunity to respond to the evidence and make representations.", "[77] When coming to its decision under s. 44(3), the Commission is entitled to consider the investigator's report, such other underlying material as it, in its discretion, considers necessary and the representations of the parties. The Commission is then obliged to make its own decision based on this information, ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra at p. 902). By doing so, it \"weighs\" the evidence before it.", "[78] As noted above, the applicant was provided with a copy of the investigator's reports and was given the opportunity to make written submissions, and as such the Commission acted in conformity of the requirements set out in the jurisprudence. However, as noted by Nadon, J., in Slattery , supra, at p. 20, \"underlying these requirements is the assumption that another aspect of procedural fairness - that the CHRC had an adequate and fair basis on which to evaluate whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant appointment of a tribunal - existed\". In my view, Nadon, J., dealt most effectively with the basis upon which the court should evaluate the Commission's decision at pp. 20 to 23 of his reasons, portions of which are reproduced below: \"In order for a fair basis to exist for the CHRC to evaluate whether a tribunal should be appointed pursuant to subparagraph 44(3)(a) of the Act , I believe that the investigation conducted prior to this decision must satisfy at least two conditions: neutrality and thoroughness. \"With regard to neutrality, it has been held that if the CHRC simply adopts an investigators' conclusions without giving reason, and those conclusions were made in a manner which may be characterized as biased, a reviewable error occurs. \"According to Noel, J. [in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of the Regional Director and the investigator, who had predetermined the issue and invited the complainant to go forth on that basis, in the 'Prior to Investigation Report', was such as to give rise to bias. Although Noel, J., acknowledged that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> permitted the CHRC to render a decision without reasons, by adopting the conclusions in the investigator's report, Noel, J., refined this analysis to the extent that, 'If the report which [the CHRC] adopted in making its decision is flawed, it must follow that the decision itself is equally flawed'. \"The requirement of thoroughness of investigation stems from the essential role that investigators play in determining the merits of particular complaints. This essential role was recognized by the Supreme Court in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case. In the words of Sopinka, J.: 'In general, complainants look to the Commission to lead evidence before a tribunal appointed under [s. 49], and therefore investigation of the complaint is essential if the [CHRC] is to carry out this role. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at p. 898)' \"In determining the degree of thoroughness of investigation required to be in accordance with the rules of procedural fairness, one must be mindful of the interests that are being balanced: the complainant's and respondent's interests in procedural fairness and the CHRC's interests in maintaining a workable and administratively effective system ... \"Deference must be given to administrative decision-makers to assess the probative value of evidence and to decide to further investigate or not to further investigate accordingly. It should only be where unreasonable omissions are made, for example where an investigator failed to investigate obviously crucial evidence, that judicial review is warranted. Such an approach is consistent with the deference allotted to fact-finding activities of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal by the Supreme Court in the case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . \"In contexts where parties have the legal right to make submissions in response to an investigator's report, such as in the case at bar, parties may be able to compensate for more minor omissions by bringing such omissions to the attention of the decision maker. Therefore, it should be only where complainants are unable to rectify such omissions that judicial review would be warranted. Although this is by no means an exhaustive list, it would seem to me that circumstances where further submissions cannot compensate for an investigator's omissions would include: (1) where the omission is of such fundamental nature that merely drawing the decision maker's attention to the omission cannot compensate for it or (2) where fundamental evidence is inaccessible to the decision maker by virtue of the protected nature of the information or where the decision maker explicitly disregards it.\"", "[79] Therefore, I must now determine whether in the case before me, sufficient thoroughness existed. As part of that determination I must be satisfied that the reports dealt with all of the fundamental issues raised in the applicant's complaint. If there were omissions in the reports, were those omissions capable of being corrected by the applicant's submissions in response to the two investigators reports? (In the case at bar, the applicant submitted extremely detailed responses.) Further, as part of that determination, I must also be satisfied that the omission, if an omission exists, was not significant or fundamental to the outcome of the case. If the omission is a fundamental one, then judicial review would be warranted. (In this regard see Nadon, J.'s, reference to Lamer, C.J.'s, comments from", "[80] However, in coming to my decision, I should also keep in mind Nadon, J.'s, comments at p. 28 of Slattery , supra: \"The fact that the investigator did not interview each and every witness that the applicant would have liked her to and the fact that the conclusion reached by the investigator did not address each and every alleged incident of discrimination are not in and of themselves fatal as well. This is particularly the case where the applicant has the opportunity to fill in gaps left by the investigator in subsequent submissions of her own. In the absence of guiding regulations, the investigators, much like the CHRC, must be master of its own procedure, and judicial review of an allegedly deficient investigation should only be warranted where the investigation is clearly deficient.\"", "[81] The next matter to be addressed is whether the Commission erred in concluding that no further proceedings were warranted in respect of the applicant's complaint.", "[82] It should be noted that when <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, was decided, s. 36(3) of the Act required the Commission to dismiss a complaint if the Commission was of the view that the complaint was \"unsubstantiated\". The decision to dismiss or to go on to the next stage was linked to the Commission's perception of the merits of the case. However, under s. 44(3) of the current Act , the Commission is to determine if the appointment of a tribunal is \"warranted\". The question of whether such a link must exist under the current Act , where a Commission finding that \"inquiry is warranted\" is the applicable standard as opposed to a \"complaint being substantiated\" was also considered by Nadon, J., in Slattery , supra. I agree with Nadon, J.'s, finding that although the statutory discretion vested upon the Commission to decide whether a complaint should be dismissed is wider under s. 44(3), it does not mean that it is unlimited or that it allows the Commission to \"completely divorce\" such decision from the merits of the complaint. However, Nadon, J., did not accept the applicant's submission that judicial review of the exercise of discretion is warranted for Commission dismissals of complaints each time, in the opinion of the reviewing court, the complaint took his or her case out of the realm of conjecture. In the end, Nadon, J., as I do, followed McIntyre, J.'s, often quoted passage from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 7: \"It is, as well, a clearly-established rule that the courts should not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a statutory authority merely because the court might have exercised the discretion in a different manner had it been charged with that responsibility. Where the statutory discretion had been exercised in good faith and, where required, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, and where reliance has not been placed upon considerations irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose, the courts should not interfere.\"", "[83] The jurisprudence is also clear that courts may review the exercise of discretionary power where such power has been exercised in a discriminatory, unfair, capricious or unreasonable manner.", "[84] The applicant alleges that all the material he submitted was not before the Commission when it made its decision, namely the documents in the List of Documents and Annexes. The respondent seems to dispute this. According to the affidavit of Lucie Veillette, secretary of the Commission, whose responsibilities included ensuring material to be considered by the Commission be provided to the Commissioners, on November 24, 1993 she sent copies of the following documents to each of the six Commissioners who would be dealing with the applicant's complaint at the meeting of December 6, 1993: 1) summary of background to investigation; 2) investigation report dated October 6, 1993; 3) applicant's complaint form, dated July 11, 1991; 4) applicant's written response dated November 8, 1993 to report dated October 6, 1993; 5) applicant's written response dated August 4, 1993, to report dated June 25, 1993, with list of exhibits; 6) CIDA's written response dated November 5, 1993 to report dated October 6, 1993; 7) investigation report dated June 25, 1993; 8) chronology of applicant's complaint.", "[85] Ms. Veillette also stated at page 1 of this package of information, the \"summary of background to investigation\", indicated to the Commissioners that the binder of 588 pages which the applicant filed with his August 4, 1993 response to the investigation report dated June 25, 1993 (the binder) would be available to the Commissioners at their meeting on December 6, 1993. The documents and the exhibits contained in the binder have been included as exhibits 1 to 8 and 10 to 23 of the applicant's affidavit sworn on April 19, 1994 and included in the applicant's application record. Ms. Veillette stated in her affidavit that the binder was available to the Commissioners during their meeting of December 6, 1993.", "[86] The evidence indicates that what was sent to the Commissioners on November 24, 1993 for its December 1993 meeting by Ms. Veillette did not contain the binder with the 588 pages of documents submitted by the applicant but did contain all of the other material. The applicant's binder was available at the meeting of the members of the Commission for them to look at if they so wished. I have no evidence that the members of the Commission did not look at this material.", "[87] I do not accept the submission of counsel for the applicant that I can assume that the Commission did not look at these documents because, on the average, each case before the Commission took 1.4 minutes to reach a decision.", "[88] The evidence clearly indicates that the Commission, as master of its own procedure, had what it considered the most relevant information before it.", "[89] If one looks at the documents found on the List of Documents and the List of Annexes, and assuming the members of the Commission did not look at some of these documents, I am not convinced the Commission failed to thoroughly consider the applicant's complaint. Conclusion", "[90] It is not for the court to substitute what it may have decided for what the Commission decided unless the Commission came to its decision in a capricious manner, that is, it decided as it did without regard to the evidence before it.", "[91] The Commission acted within its jurisdiction when it examined the evidence placed before it and decided, notwithstanding a recommendation to appoint a conciliator, that the complaint should be dismissed.", "[92] The applicant was, at all times, given the opportunity of reply and was given copies of all reports and submissions. There is no evidence the Commission acted unfairly.", "[93] The application for judicial review is denied. Application dismissed. Editor: Jana A. Andersen/blk [End of document]"]}

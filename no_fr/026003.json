{"id_": "026003", "body_str": ["[1] O'Keefe, J. : This is a motion dated January 20, 2000, by the defendant, The Royal Bank of Canada for an order striking out in whole or in part the affidavit of James William Andrew sworn October 27, 1999. The affidavit was filed in support of the plaintiff's summary judgment motion.", "[2] The plaintiff is a ship builder and ship repair yard in the Netherlands that allegedly performed repairs to a ship called the \"Cast Husky\". The plaintiff has not been paid for that work. The claim is the main proceeding is a claim against the Royal Bank for pay­ment of its statement of account as it alleges the Royal Bank came into possession of insurance proceeds from which it should have been paid.", "[3] The Royal Bank of Canada (defendant) objected to the affidavit on various grounds including: \"(a) the affiant did not have personal knowledge of the matters deposed to and; \"(b) did not state his beliefs or the grounds, therefore; \"(c) the affiant did not obtain leave of the court to both depose to an affidavit and present argument to the court based on that affidavit. The affiant is a solicitor in the office of the law firm that represents the plaintiff. \"(d) certain paragraphs the affidavit are conclusions of law.\"", "[4] After the defendant filed the present motion objecting to the affidavit the affiant filed a second affidavit sworn on January 27, 2000. In the second affidavit it is stated that it was given for the following reasons: \"2 This affidavit is made by me to supple­ment my affidavit sworn October 27, 1999, and filed in support of the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment herein. It is also made for the purpose of responding to the motion of the defendant, The Royal Bank of Canada (the 'defendant'), to strike out various paragraphs of my said affida­vit.\"", "[5] The defendant submitted that both affi­davits should be struck.", "[6] The affiant obtained most of the facts he deposed to from a representative of the plaintiff in the Netherlands. Issue: Should Either Or Both Of The Affidavits Filed By The Affiant Be Struck? Law", "[7] Rules 81 and 82 of the Federal Court Rules , 1998 state: \"81(1) Contents of Affidavits - Affidavits shall be confined to facts within the per­sonal knowledge of the deponent, except on motions in which statements as to the deponent's belief, with the grounds therefor, may be included. \"(2) Affidavits on belief - Where an affi­davit is made on belief, an adverse infer­ence may be drawn from the failure of a party to provide evidence of persons hav­ing personal knowledge of material facts. \"(3) Use of solicitor's affidavit - Except with leave of the court, a solicitor shall not both depose to an affidavit and present argument to the court based on that affi­davit.\" Analysis And Findings", "[8] It is apparent from rule 81 that the person deposing the affidavit should only depose to facts within his or her personal knowledge except on motions when statements as to the deponents belief, with the grounds therefor, may be used.", "[9] It may be that the deponent's affidavit of January 27, 2000 cleared up the shortfalls of the first affidavit in relation to rule 81(1) however, that is not the end of the matter. Rule 82 requires that a solicitor obtain the leave if the court before both deposing to an affidavit and presenting argument to the court based on the affidavit.", "[10] No leave of the court has yet being sought.", "[11] There is always a danger in a solicitor deposing to an affidavit and then using the affidavit on a motion which the solicitor argues or members of his firm argues. The solicitor could be cross examined, privilege issues may arise on cross-examination and the court would have to comment and weigh the allegations made by the solicitor in the affidavit. As well the solicitor's law firm could not continue to appear for the defendant in the motion in which the affidavit was used (see", "[12] In the present motion there is a dispute concerning some of the facts deposed to by the deponent.", "[13] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), Muldoon, J., stated: \"There are at least three good reasons for rejecting affidavits sworn by solicitors and counsel for a party. First, everyone including the speaker has the right and obligation to be perfectly clear about whether he or she speaks as a witness or as a professional adviser. Secondly is the possibility of conflict with professional responsibility. Affidavits like oral testimony are expressed solemnly upon oath or the legal (if not moral) equivalent thereof. No counsel or solicitor, who is, after all, an officer of the court, ought ever to place himself or herself into the quandry of risking a conflict of interest between remunerative (but yet honourable) advocacy and possibly unpalatable truth sworn on oath. See s. 11(3) of the Federal Court Act , R.S.C. 1970, c. 10 (2nd Supp.). No witness can deal objectively with the weight or credibility of his own testimony. Lawyers for opposing parties ought not to be exigible to cross-examination by each other, for fear of sacrifice of one role for the other, or the lamentable appearance of such sacrifice. Third, unless the solicitor or counsel obtain the previous blanket absolution of the client, then he or she will be obliged to assert the client's solicitor-and-client privilege mentally when formulating the affidavit and, or course, orally only when being cross-examined on it. As was stated by Addy, J., in the Lex case at p. 186 C.P.R. pp. 723-724 F.C. 'Whatever might be the motive for doing so, it is completely improper and unacceptable for a solicitor to take an affidavit even in an interlocutory matter where he attests to matters of substance and might therefore expose himself to being cross-examined on matters covered by solicitor-and-client privilege.' Here counsel for the respondents has placed them in the jeopardy of having the affidavit in support of their serious, urgent and important motions utterly rejected because he is the deponent.\" I agree with the finding of Muldoon, J., that a solicitor should not file his or her affidavit on a motion when the solicitor is the counsel for a party. I hasten to point out that the solicitor who deposed the affidavit in the present case did so only because he believed that the facts he deposed to were not in dispute. As it turns out the plaintiff states the facts are in dispute.", "[14] It is clear that the person who informed the deponent as to the facts could have deposed to the facts.", "[15] I must point out that in certain cases, counsel for the party may depose to facts in an affidavit and appear and use the affidavit on a motion. For example if the solicitor is the only person who can depose to these facts then it would be acceptable for counsel to depose to the facts and then appear and use the affidavit on a motion. There are I am sure other examples.", "[16] For the purposes of this decision I consider that should a solicitor in a firm depose to facts in an affidavit and the affidavit is filed for use on the motion then another member of the firm should not argue the motion. This is of course subject to the exception of paragraph 15 of this decision.", "[17] For the reasons stated above I would strike out both affidavits of the deponent.", "[18] There shall be no order as to costs in this motion. Motion granted. Editor: Gary W. McLaughlin/saf [End of document]"]}

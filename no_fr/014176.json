{"id_": "014176", "body_str": ["[1] Barnes, J. : This is a motion brought on consent under Federal Courts Rules , SOR/98-106, Rule 334.16 seeking to certify this action as a Class proceeding on behalf of 1056 disabled RCMP veterans. At the same time the parties have moved for the approval of a proposed settlement of the proceeding under Rule 334.29. I. Background", "[2] The matters in issue in this proceeding are similar to those that were dealt with by the Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 787; 2012 FC 499, [2012] FCJ No 512; 2013 FC 341, [2013] FCJ No 363. In that proceeding a Class Certification Order was granted on behalf of several thousand disabled Canadian Forces (CF) veterans seeking to recover the offset of their RSC 1985, c P-6, benefits from income payable under the Canadian Forces Long Term Disability (LTD) policy. That Certification Order was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010], 3 SCR 672, and the case went forward as a Class proceeding. On an interlocutory motion brought by the parties I determined a disputed point of contractual interpretation in favour of the Class. Specifically, I found that the practice of deducting disability payments from CF veterans' LTD income was unlawful. That decision was not appealed and, after lengthy negotiations, a financial settlement was reached between the parties.", "[3] This action also concerns the lawfulness of the Defendant's practise of offsetting disability benefits from the income replacement benefits payable to disabled RCMP veterans under the RCMP LTD policy. It is noteworthy, however, that the contractual interpretation issue that arises in this case is different from the one that was resolved in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> proceeding.", "[4] The RCMP LTD policy arguably has a stronger benefit offset clause than the CF LTD policy. In the case of the CF LTD policy the offset was held not to be deductible, because the operative contractual clause only permitted the deduction of income benefits and not amounts payable as disability benefits. The RCMP LTD policy does not limit the offset of benefits to income replacements but, instead, refers to \"payments [received] under the for an occupational disability \"... In the result, a significantly different issue of contractual interpretation arises in this case from the question that was answered in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .", "[5] This matter was heard at Halifax on June 20, 2014. From the affidavit of Daniel Wallace it is apparent that the Preliminary Notice of the proposed settlement was sent by regular mail to all 1056 members of the proposed Class and, of those, 126 were returned as undeliverable. Counsel for the proposed Class also sent the Preliminary Notice to 160 members on their contact list. The Notice is also posted on the internet including the Veterans Affairs Canada website. I am satisfied that effective notice has been given to most of the members of the proposed Class and that the responses received are representative of the views of the Class. Of the 50 responses received as of June 5, 2014, only three expressed concern about the terms of settlement and no one expressed a concern about certification. When the matter was heard, several members of the proposed Class were in attendance but only the Plaintiff, David White, elected to make representations to the Court. He expressed strong support both for the terms of settlement and for the amount requested for legal fees and disbursements. A. Should this Action Be Certified As a Class Proceeding?", "[6] The parties propose the following Class definition: All former members of the RCMP whose long-term disability benefits under Great West Life Assurance Company Group Policy Number 24892GM (\"GWL-LTD Plan\") were reduced by the amount of their VAC Disability benefits received pursuant to the", "[7] This description of the Class appears to be inclusive of those who have an immediate financial interest in the proposed recovery of benefits.", "[8] For the reasons given previously in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 787, and, additionally, on the strength of the Defendant's consent, it is appropriate to certify this action as a Class proceeding under Rule 334.16. All of the requirements of that Rule have been met. Furthermore, in the context of a motion to certify that coincides with a provisional settlement of the proceeding a rigorous approach to certification is unnecessary and unwarranted: see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . B. Should the Proposed Settlement Be Approved?", "[9] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> I discussed the general principles that apply to the settlement of a Class proceeding. The following points apply equally here: General Principles Applicable to Class Action Settlements", "[4] Court approval of a class action settlement is appropriate where, in the overall circumstances, it is deemed to be fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the class as a whole: see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] BCJ No 192.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2006] FCJ No 363, Justice Dani√®le Tremblay-Lamer, described the general approach to the approval of a class settlement in this Court: 7 The Court with a class action settlement before it does not expect perfection, but rather that the settlement be reasonable, a good compromise between the two parties. The purpose of a settlement is to avoid the risks of a trial. Even if it is not perfect, the settlement may be in the best interests of those affected by it, particularly when the risks and the costs of a trial are considered. It is always necessary to consider that a proposed settlement represents the parties' desire to settle the matter out of court without any admission by either party regarding the facts or regarding the law.", "[5] It is not open to the reviewing Court to rewrite the substantive terms of a proposed settlement nor should the interests of individual class members be assessed in isolation from the interests of the entire class: see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on QL).", "[6] It will always be a particular concern of the Court that an arms-length settlement negotiated in good faith not be too readily rejected. The parties are, after all, best placed to assess the risks and costs (financial and human) associated with taking complex class litigation to its conclusion. The rejection of a multi-faceted settlement like the one negotiated here also carries the risk that the process of negotiation will unravel and the spirit of compromise will be lost.", "[10] The settlement proposed by the parties for approval in this case is the culmination of months of negotiations. It provides for the rebate to members of the Class of a substantial percentage of the benefits that were deducted from their LTD income and it completely eliminates that offset going forward. The parties estimate the value of the settlement to be about $70 million made up of $30.6 million for past-due amounts, $9.1 million for interest calculated to October 31, 2014 and $30.3 million representing the present value of benefits payable to LTD recipients in the future.", "[11] The proposed amount payable to Class members for retroactive benefits constitutes 82% of their maximum best-case recovery. The parties explain the 18% discount on the basis of their litigation risks including the Defendant's concession that its limitation defence will be withdrawn.", "[12] The amounts payable to Class members or to their immediate surviving dependants will include simple interest dating back to February 1, 1992 at rates of between 3% and 6% per year. The payments are, of course, subject to income tax.", "[13] A comprehensive and simplified approach to determining eligibility has been proposed including a right of appeal to an independent adjudicator.", "[14] The Defendant has agreed to pay to Class legal counsel an administrative fee of $18.00 per member to cover the cost of distributing benefits. The Defendant will also pay for the cost of engaging a professional monitor to ensure ongoing compliance with the terms of settlement.", "[15] In return for the above benefits the Defendant and the Great West Life Assurance Company will be released and discharged from any further liability arising from the offset of benefits as described above.", "[16] In many respects the above terms of settlement are consistent with those that were approved in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. The full particulars of the settlement are described in the Order below.", "[17] It is apparent to me that the vast majority of Class members approve of the terms of settlement. That is to be expected because the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable. For anyone who elects to pursue an individual recovery, there is a right to opt out of the Class settlement within 60 days of the issuance of this Order. That step would, of course, entail the commencement of a personal legal action at considerable expense and risk and, in my view, would not be prudent. Nevertheless, this is a full answer to the concerns expressed by a few members of the Class about the terms of settlement.", "[18] I am satisfied that the terms of the proposed settlement are fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the Class as whole. In particular, the proposed 18% discount on past-due benefits is readily justified by the litigation risks and by the value of other benefits obtained. There was a very real risk that this action could be dismissed outright or, alternatively, that the Defendant's limitations defence would substantially limit the amounts recoverable. The further achievement of the elimination of the offset into the future is also a significant benefit that justifies the modest reduction from past recoveries.", "[19] For the foregoing reasons, the settlement as proposed is approved.", "[20] Counsel for the Class propose to deduct legal fees from the retroactive refunds payable to members in the amount of 8% and a further deduction of 0.064% is sought to reimburse counsel for out-of-pocket expenses. Inasmuch as there is no workable method to collect legal fees from refunds payable into the distant future, this represents a feasible approach to the issue.", "[21] The 8% deduction for legal fees from retroactive refunds is consistent with the approach the Court took in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. Indeed, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the total value of the settlement was substantially greater than this one. Generally speaking, in very large or megafund settlements, the greater the amount recovered the lower the percentage that will be justified for legal fees. Notwithstanding the substantially lower amount recovered in this case on behalf of the Class, counsel propose a legal fee recovery that is consistent with the amount approved in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .", "[22] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> I described the factors that should be applied to the assessment of legal fees in a Class proceeding as follows:", "[28] At the heart of the application of Rule 334.4 is the requirement that legal fees payable to class counsel be fair and reasonable: see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ ]. In determining what is fair and reasonable the Court must look at a number of factors including the results achieved, the extent of the risk assumed by class counsel, the amount of professional time actually incurred, the causal link between the legal effort and the results obtained, the quality of the representation, the complexity of the issues raised by the litigation, the character and importance of the litigation, the likelihood that individual claims would have been litigated in any event, the views expressed by the class, the existence of a fee agreement and the fees approved in comparable cases. Some authorities have also recognized a broader public interest in controlling the fees payable to the legal profession: see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> BCJ No 1254 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].", "[23] There is no serious opposition to the proposed fees. Class counsel assumed considerable risk by taking this case on and have worked hard and ably to obtain a generous recovery on behalf of the Class. They are entitled to a reasonable recovery for their efforts particularly where the impact of legal fees on the recoveries payable to members will not be disproportionate.", "[24] For the foregoing reasons the proposed legal fees and disbursements recovery is approved.

A declaration that the Pension Act Offset is severed from the remainder of the GWL-LTD Plan and declared void as it is illegal, in breach of the Charter and/or contrary to public policy; k.

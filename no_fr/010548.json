{"id_": "010548", "body_str": ["[1] Layden-Stevenson, J. : Mr. Cantell asks that his application for an extension of time within which to apply for a decision from the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister) under section 131 of the Customs Act, R.S. 1985, c. 1 (2nd Supp.) be granted. The request is brought under section 129.2 of the Customs Act (the Act). Mr. Cantell applied to the Minister for the extension of time under section 129.1, but was refused by decision dated July 14, 2003. BACKGROUND", "[2] The facts giving rise to this matter are not complicated. Mr. Cantell and his wife live in St. Catharines, Ontario. They frequently travel to New York state to visit family and friends. On June 13, 2002, a customs officer at Niagara Falls, Ontario, conducted a search of Mr. Cantell's vehicle. The officer discovered four bottles of wine and a container of pepper spray. Those items were seized and, in addition, Mr. Cantell's CANPASS card and vehicle decal were taken from him and a one year notice of suspension was issued. No vehicle penalty was levied. Mr. Cantell had a previous infraction under the Act on September 9, 2000.", "[3] Section 129 of the Act allows a person from whom goods are seized to apply to the Minister for a decision under section 131 of the Act. Section 131 (which provides for ministerial review regarding specified seizures) is, for purposes of the matter before me, irrelevant and I need not be concerned with it. Section 129 provides that the person has 90 days within which to request a section 131 decision. The request may be made by giving notice in writing or by any other means satisfactory to the Minister.", "[4] The Customs Seizure Receipt provided to Mr. Cantell included a section entitled \"Right to Request a Minister's Decision\" wherein the right to file an objection and request a decision of the Minister within 90 days was delineated. Mr. Cantell missed the 90-day time limit to apply for the section 131 review. However, subsection 129.1 of the Act allows a person, who has not made a request within 90 days, to apply to the Minister for an extension of time. The right to apply for and be granted an extension of time by the Minister, in exceptional cases, was also set out in the above-noted paragraph of the Customs Seizure Receipt. By virtue of subsection 129.1(2), an applicant must provide reasons for not having submitted the request on time.", "[5] Mr. Cantell requested an extension of time on April 11, 2003. In so doing, he addressed what might best be described as the merits of his request under section 131, but he did not explain his delay in making the application. By correspondence dated May 27, 2003, an adjudicator at Customs Appeals Directorate requested that Mr. Cantell provide the reasons why he had not met the 90 day time requirement. Mr. Cantell provided his explanation in correspondence dated June 2, 2003.", "[6] An adjudicator of the Customs and Appeal Directorate of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency reviewed the information contained in the June 2nd correspondence and recommended that Mr. Cantell's application for an extension of time be denied. The manager of Customs and Appeals Directorate rendered a negative decision on July 14, 2003. Mr. Cantell filed his application under section 129.2 of the Act on August 26, 2003.", "[7] At the hearing on June 28, 2004, the matter was argued as an application for judicial review. The court referred to section 129.2 of the Act and noted that it provides that an application for an extension of time may be made to the court when, among other things, the Minister dismisses the application under section 129.1. The parties requested and were granted the opportunity to file further written submissions. Both parties served and filed submissions by July 30, 2004 as directed. Only the respondent filed a reply submission. THE RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS", "[8] The statutory provisions touching upon this matter are attached to these reasons as Schedule \"A\". For ease of reference, sections 129.1 and 129.2 are reproduced here. Customs Act, R.S. 1985, c. 1 (2nd Supp.) 129.1 (1) If no request for a decision of the Minister is made under section 129 within the time provided in that section, a person may apply in writing to the Minister for an extension of the time for making the request and the Minister may grant the application. (2) An application must set out the reasons why the request was not made on time. (3) The burden of proof that an application has been made under subsection (1) lies on the person claiming to have made it. (4) The Minister must, without delay after making a decision in respect of an application, notify the applicant in writing of the decision. (5) The application may not be granted unless (a) it is made within one year after the expiration of the time provided in section 129; and (b) the applicant demonstrates that (i) within the time provided in section 129, the applicant was unable to request a decision or to instruct another person to request a decision on the applicant's behalf or the applicant had a bona fide intention to request a decision, (ii) it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and (iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted. 129.2 (1) A person may apply to the Federal Court to have their application under section 129.1 granted if (a) the Minister dismisses that application; or (b) ninety days have expired after the application was made and the Minister has not notified the person of a decision made in respect of it. If paragraph (a) applies, the application under this subsection must be made within ninety days after the application is dismissed. (2) The application must be made by filing a copy of the application made under section 129.1, and any notice given in respect of it, with the Minister and the Administrator of the Court. (3) The Court may grant or dismiss the application and, if it grants the application, may impose any terms that it considers just or order that the request under section 129 be deemed to have been made on the date the order was made. (4) The application may not be granted unless (a) the application under subsection 129.1(1) was made within one year after the expiration of the time provided in section 129; and (b) the person making the application demonstrates that (i) within the time provided in section 129 for making a request for a decision of the Minister, the person was unable to act or to instruct another person to act in the person's name or had a bona fide intention to request a decision, (ii) it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and (iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted. THE REASONS ADVANCED IN SUPPORT OF AN EXTENSION OF TIME", "[9] Several months after the seizure, Mr. Cantell learned that as a consequence of the infraction, his name was red-flagged in the customs data bank and would remain so for a period of approximately seven years. As a result, each time he crosses the border, his vehicle is searched.", "[10] Mrs. Cantell has a lengthy history of back problems. She underwent spinal surgery several years ago. Near the end of April, 2002, her symptoms resurfaced. Mr. Cantell says that his wife is in extreme discomfort when she has to stand during the lengthy time that is required for customs officials to search his vehicle. He submits that, had he known that he would be red-flagged, he would have recognized the \"long term hardship conditions that this does impose upon my physically handicapped wife and would then have been obliged to elevate the matter for priority attention\".", "[11] He submits that his wife was undergoing numerous tests, procedures and evaluations during the months following the seizure and that \"the personal events of the following months would have precluded my attention for this and other matters. The events referred to involve the medical condition of my wife\". He claims that the months of testing were extremely traumatic and contributed to his lack of attention to this matter. His preoccupation with these pressing matters precluded consideration of instructing someone to act on his behalf and in any event, he did not consider this very personal matter suitable to involve another lay person nor was it economically feasible to seek professional help. ANALYSIS", "[12] To obtain an extension of time, Mr. Cantell must meet the criteria set out in subsection 129.2(4). His application was made within one year after the expiration of the time provided in section 129. He must also establish that he was unable to act, to instruct another person to act on his behalf or had a bona fide intention to appeal. Finally, he must demonstrate that it would be just and equitable to grant the extension of time and that the application was made as soon as circumstances permit.", "[13] Mr. Cantell has not satisfied any of these conditions. There is no evidence of a bona fide intention to request a decision within the 90 days. While I appreciate that Mr. Cantell was distracted by his wife's circumstances, by his own admission, his application was made only \"when the full repercussions of the incident\" became apparent. It thus cannot be said that he had a \"bona fide intention\" to request a decision:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). His admission applies equally to his failure to instruct another person to act on his behalf.", "[14] I am also not satisfied that it would be just and equitable to grant the extension of time. This was Mr. Cantell's second infraction. He personally received the Customs Seizure Receipt outlining the process available to him. He chose not to seek a decision from the Minister until such time as he became aware of the data bank entry some ten months after the fact. He did not make the application as soon as circumstances permitted.", "[15] The criteria mandated in paragraph 129.2(4) of the Act not having been met, the application must be dismissed. In reality, Mr. Cantell takes issue, not with the seizure, but with what he regards as a \"penalty\" arising out of his infraction. While I am inclined to regard it as a consequence, the court lacks jurisdiction to review the penalty imposed when there is an infraction of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). ORDER", "[16] The application is dismissed but without costs. SCHEDULE \"A\" to the Reasons for Order and Order dated August 13, 2004 rendered by the Hon. Madam Justice Carolyn Layden-Stevenson in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Supp.) 126.1 Sections 127 to 133 do not apply to a contravention of subsection 40(3) of this Act by a person referred to in paragraph (c) of that subsection, or to a contravention of section 32.2 of this Act in circumstances to which subsection 32.2(6) of this Act applies, or to a contravention of subsection 95(1), 118(1) or (2), 121(1) or 122(1) of the Customs Tariff. 127.

{"id_": "060251", "body_str": ["[1] Simpson, J. : A new type of air freshener has been developed. It neutralizes and eliminates offensive odours rather than masking them with other scents. The plaintiffs' application for an interlocutory injunction arises in the context of the parties' efforts to introduce their respective odour neutralizing air fresheners into the North American market.", "[2] The plaintiff S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. (\"S.C. Johnson U.S.\") manufactures and distributes a wide variety of household consumer products including air fresheners. The plaintiff S.C. Johnson and Son, Limited (\"S.C. Johnson Canada\") distributes the aforementioned products in Canada. Together, the plaintiffs will be described as \"S.C. Johnson\". S.C. Johnson U.S., with its affiliates, is the world leader in air care products. Its odour neutralizing air freshener bears the trademark NEUTRA-FRESH.", "[3] The defendants Reckitt & Colman (Overseas) Limited and Reckitt & Colman Canada Inc. (together \"Reckitt & Colman\") are subsidiaries of a company known as Reckitt & Colman plc. It is based in the United Kingdom and is the principal company in the Reckitt & Colman group of companies. The group, through various subsidiaries around the world, manufactures and sells a wide variety of products including air fresheners. Reckitt & Colman's odour neutralizing air freshener is marketed internationally under the trademark NEUTRA AIR. Reckitt & Colman acknowledges that S.C. Johnson is its most significant competitor in the sale of air care products in North America. NEUTRA-FRESH", "[4] In the course of preparations for the launch of its NEUTRA-FRESH air freshener in North America, S.C. Johnson learned that a company called Knight Marketing Corporation (\"Knight\") was already marketing a neutralizing air freshener using the trademark NEUTRA-FRESH. Knight had sold its NEUTRA-FRESH air fresheners in the United States from 1989 and in Canada from 1990. Knight had registered NEUTRA-FRESH in New York State but had no Canadian trademark registrations. In Canada since 1990, Knight had sold only 1,800 units of its air freshener packaged in the retail size. Those units were marketed primarily through auto shops but were also available in hardware stores and in food and convenience stores. In addition, Knight sold a large 3.78 litre bottle to institutional purchasers.", "[5] In order to proceed with the introduction of its NEUTRA-FRESH products, S.C. Johnson U.S. acquired, for valuable consideration, all Knight's rights in the trademark NEUTRA-FRESH including all associated goodwill. The acquisition was documented on July 29, 1994, although an oral agreement had earlier been reached in April of 1994. As a term of the acquisition, Knight was permitted to sell off its inventory until December 31, 1994. Following its acquisition of the NEUTRA-FRESH trademark from Knight, S.C. Johnson U.S. filed an application in the Canadian Trade-Mark Office to register the trademark NEUTRA-FRESH for air fresheners.", "[6] As the launch date for its NEUTRA-FRESH products approached, S.C. Johnson learned that a second company called Belmar Equipment Inc. (\"Belmar\") had started to market an odour neutralizing air freshener called NEUTRA-FRESH, in Canada. Accordingly, immediately after the acquisition of the NEUTRA-FRESH trademark from Knight, S.C. Johnson sent Belmar a cease and desist letter dated July 29th, 1994. Ultimately, S.C. Johnson purchased, for valuable consideration, all Belmar's rights in the trademark NEUTRA-FRESH including all related goodwill. That acquisition was made on September 24, 1994.", "[7] Belmar's sales had started in April of 1994. From that date, its NEUTRA-FRESH air freshener was sold across Canada, packaged in 60 and 200 ml retail sizes. Belmar also sold a larger wholesale unit but 85% of its sales were to retail stores and to mass marketers. In six months Belmar's distributor had sold a total of 9,561 retail units.", "[8] In June 1994, S.C. Johnson Canada finalized its NEUTRA-FRESH labelling for Canada. The four NEUTRA-FRESH products (aerosol carpet and room deodorizers, electric gel with warmer unit and electric gel refills) were introduced to S.C. Johnson's sales staff in mid-July and to trade customers in August. Listing agreements were made with retailers, orders were taken and S.C. Johnson's NEUTRA-FRESH products were shipped to warehouses across Canada in early September with a view to their first appearance on retail shelves in mid-September 1994.", "[9] However, at the eleventh hour, S.C. Johnson decided not to proceed with the NEUTRA-FRESH launch in Canada. This decision was made in response to an interlocutory injunction (the \"U.S. Injunction\") obtained by a member of the Reckitt & Colman group of companies in the United States (Reckitt & Colman U.S.). S.C. Johnson says that, because of the U.S. Injunction, it was compelled, for business reasons, to abort the NEUTRA-FRESH launch in Canada. The U.S. Injunction prohibited the launch of S.C. Johnson's NEUTRA-FRESH products in the United States. S.C. Johnson's decision not to launch NEUTRA-FRESH in Canada because of the U.S. Injunction must be critically examined because it created an unusual situation. In essence, the plaintiffs seek extraordinary equitable relief to protect their NEUTRA-FRESH trademark from suffering a loss of distinctiveness due to NEUTRA AIR's sole presence in the Canadian market. However, there is no legal impediment to S.C. Johnson's use of its NEUTRA-FRESH trademark in Canada and, if it were used, it would be significantly more difficult and perhaps impossible for S.C. Johnson to make a case for an interlocutory injunction in this jurisdiction.", "[10] In late 1993, following the introduction of its NEUTRA AIR odour neutralizing air freshener in other parts of the world, Reckitt & Colman began to prepare for the launch of NEUTRA AIR in North America. In July 1994, Reckitt & Colman began sales presentations of its two NEUTRA AIR products (carpet deodorizers and air fresheners). Orders were received and NEUTRA AIR products were shipped on August 17. They were first offered for retail sale in Knob Hill Farms stores in the week of August 19, 1994. In the following weeks, the NEUTRA AIR products were distributed to many retail locations across Canada including Oshawa Foods (IGA, Food City - Ontario), Loeb, Lumsden, Hy & Zel's, Sobeys, Bolands, Wal-Mart, Federated Co-op and London Drugs.", "[11] As of November 7, 1994, Reckitt & Colman had sold approximately 15,000 cases or 175,000 containers of NEUTRA AIR products. In connection with the launch of the NEUTRA AIR products, Reckitt & Colman purchased television advertisements and television time for $650,000. The ads were shown across Canada in English and in French in the period from November 14 to December 10, 1994. However, it should be noted that Reckitt & Colman took a risk with their advertising expenditure because the advertising contract was made in October of 1994 after the plaintiffs' action had been commenced. The television ads are described by Reckitt & Colman as a \"high profile media campaign\" and it anticipates a \"sales surge\" in response to the ad campaign. Reckitt & Colman has also spent a further $100,000 on research and development associated with the NEUTRA AIR launch and retail store listings were purchased for approximately $200,000. Reckitt & Colman considers itself an innovator in the Canadian market because, although it did not develop the first odour neutralizing air freshener, it claims that it was the first vendor of the product in this country. The U.S. Injunction And S.C. Johnson's", "[12] The U.S. Injunction was granted on September 20, 1994, after a brief hearing which lasted about one hour. There was no time prior to the hearing for cross-examinations on the affidavits filed in support of the injunction application. The U.S. Injunction prohibits S.C. Johnson from selling its air and carpet freshening products in the United States using the trademark NEUTRA-FRESH and the trade dress in which they were packaged. The U.S. Injunction was granted on the basis that the NEUTRA-FRESH trademark and associated trade dress were confusing with Reckitt & Colman's NEUTRA AIR products. S.C. Johnson argued forcefully before me that the judge relied on inaccurate representations made by counsel retained by Reckitt & Colman U.S. He apparently submitted that Knight's use of NEUTRA-FRESH in the United States did not give S.C. Johnson priority over NEUTRA AIR because Knight's air freshener was primarily an institutional rather than a retail product. I was asked by S.C. Johnson to find that this submission was misleading and that the U.S. Injunction was wrongly granted. I was also asked to use this finding as a factor in my consideration of the equities in this application. It was submitted that Reckitt & Colman should not benefit from the U.S. Injunction by maintaining in Canada the competitive advantage it improperly obtained in the United States. Counsel for Reckitt & Colman before me did not deal with this issue on the basis that his clients in this litigation were not parties to the U.S. Injunction proceedings.", "[13] I have concluded that the propriety of the submissions made by counsel for Reckitt & Colman U.S. to the judge who granted the U.S. Injunction cannot and need not be dealt with on this application. The U.S. Injunction has been appealed and, in due course, all the issues will be considered in the proper forum and with the proper parties before the court. In my view, the U.S. Injunction is relevant in these proceedings only because, whether obtained rightly or wrongly, it was the catalyst for S.C. Johnson's decision to \"kill\" the NEUTRA-FRESH launch in Canada. Absent the U.S. Injunction and S.C. Johnson's decision to terminate the Canadian launch, NEUTRA-FRESH would have reached the Canadian market approximately three weeks after Reckitt & Colman's NEUTRA AIR first appeared on retail shelves.", "[14] S.C. Johnson says that Reckitt & Colman \"had to know\" that the U.S. Injunction would throw S.C. Johnson's North American plans for the NEUTRA-FRESH launch into disarray. The evidence is clear that both companies intended to use their trademarks throughout North America. S.C. Johnson submits that, had it continued with the NEUTRA-FRESH launch in Canada, Reckitt & Colman would have moved to enjoin its marketing. Reckitt & Colman wrote a demand letter dated September 23, 1994 which creates the clear impression that it would have sought an injunction in Canada. Although the merits are different in this jurisdiction and an injunction might not have been granted, the outcome of litigation is always unpredictable. Given S.C. Johnson's experience with the U.S. Injunction, I accept that concern about injunction proceedings by Reckitt & Colman in Canada contributed to S.C. Johnson's decision to terminate the NEUTRA-FRESH launch in this country.", "[15] The evidence discloses that S.C. Johnson now \"prefers\" to use substantially similar packaging and identical trademarks for its products throughout North America notwithstanding that, in the past, different trademarks have sometimes been used in Canada and the United States. S.C. Johnson says that, since the trade dress and trademark which had been developed for North America cannot be used in the United States because of the U.S. injunction, it has decided not to sell any of the NEUTRA-FRESH products presently in warehouses in Canada and the United States. Those products will remain in storage. S.C. Johnson intends to re-enter the North American market with those NEUTRA-FRESH products as soon as a resolution of the U.S. Injunction proceeding makes that possible.", "[16] However, no date is set for the appeal of the U.S. Injunction. Accordingly, in the expectation that a resolution may be some time away and with a determination to have a competitive odour neutralizing air freshener in the North American market, S.C. Johnson has repackaged its products under the trademark GLADE NEUTRALIZER for mass merchandising in Canada and the United States. It began the repackaging after the U.S. Injunction was granted on September 20, 1994 and GLADE NEUTRALIZER products were first shipped on November 4, 1994. This precedent suggests that, if an injunction were to be granted in this proceeding, Reckitt & Colman would be able to bring replacement products to market in approximately six weeks.", "[17] S.C. Johnson has recently taken steps to use the NEUTRA-FRESH trademark in Canada so that, if the U.S. Injunction is lifted, S.C. Johnson's trademark rights will have been preserved. Pending the appeal of the U.S. Injunction, Knight will continue to sell NEUTRA-FRESH products under a licence from S.C. Johnson dated November 28, 1994. However, sales will continue at the former modest levels achieved by Knight. NEUTRA-FRESH products will not be advertised or mass marketed on the scale adopted by Reckitt & Colman for NEUTRA AIR. For this reason the NEUTRA-FRESH trademark will, in S.C. Johnson's submission, be \"swamped\" by the NEUTRA AIR trademark which Reckitt & Colman admits is confusing. S.C. Johnson argues that, unless an injunction is granted in this proceeding which prohibits Reckitt & Colman's use of NEUTRA AIR, the NEUTRA-FRESH mark will lose its distinctiveness and will, for all practical purposes, not be suitable for mass introduction into the Canadian market if the U.S. Injunction is dissolved.", "[18] I have concluded that S.C. Johnson's strategy in face of the U.S. Injunction represents a reasonable business response to the disruption of its North American NEUTRA-FRESH launch. The decision not to market NEUTRA-FRESH products in Canada was driven by the U.S. Injunction and by S.C. Johnson's belief that, as a business matter, it made no sense to use one trademark and trade dress (NEUTRA-FRESH) in Canada and another (GLADE NEUTRALIZER) in the United States pending the appeal of the U.S. Injunction. It was not simply a \"voluntary\" decision as the defendants suggest. Accordingly, S.C. Johnson's decision not to market NEUTRA-FRESH in Canada will not disentitle it to injunctive relief. The Standard For Injunctive Relief", "[19] Before addressing the merits, I must determine whether my decision on this application will finally dispose of the issues between the parties. Reckitt & Colman's evidence discloses that, if the injunction is granted, it will abandon its defence and counterclaim in this litigation. If it is enjoined from using the NEUTRA AIR trademark it will not litigate in the hope of being able to reintroduce NEUTRA AIR products into Canada at a future date. Rather, it will repackage its products under a new trademark and commit to the long term use of that mark in Canada even though that would mean using different trademarks for its air fresheners in Canada and the United States. Essentially, Reckitt & Colman is saying that it places less importance on the need for marketing with one trademark throughout North America than does S.C. Johnson. However, this response is not unreasonable in the circumstances because, unlike S.C. Johnson, Reckitt & Colman is now using its preferred trademark in the United States which is the dominant North American market. Reckitt & Colman may sensibly conclude that Canada, as the smaller market, does not justify the expense of ongoing litigation and the outlay associated with (i) warehousing NEUTRA AIR products; (ii) the introduction of an interim trademark; and (iii) the reintroduction of NEUTRA AIR products in the event of successful litigation. Because this action is exclusively for passing off and because I find the defendants' evidence credible, I accept that, even though NEUTRA AIR is Reckitt & Colman's international trademark for air fresheners, this application for an injunction will finally dispose of this litigation from the defendants' perspective. It will also be dispositive for S.C. Johnson. It has made it clear that, without the injunction, its NEUTRA-FRESH trademark will have no value by the time this matter is ready for trial. That being so, I have concluded that the \"Woods exception\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1 (F.C.A.).) is applicable and that S.C. Johnson must demonstrate a prima facie case on the merits in order to be entitled to an injunction. The Merits", "[20] The Statement of Claim relies on s. 7(b) and (c) of the Trade-marks Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13 (the \" Act \"). They read: \"7. No person shall (b) direct public attention to his wares, services or business in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause confusion in Canada, at the time he commenced so to direct attention to them , between his wares, services or business and the wares, services or business of another; (the emphasis is mine.) (c) pass off other wares or services as and for those ordered or requested;\"", "[21] Reckitt & Colman submits that, even though NEUTRA AIR and NEUTRA-FRESH are confusing marks and even though S.C. Johnson has purchased Knight's and Belmar's prior rights, the merits are in doubt and a prima facie case has not been established. This submission is made on the basis that, at the time Reckitt & Colman commenced directing public attention to NEUTRA AIR in Canada, S.C. Johnson was not identified with NEUTRA-FRESH in Canada. No confusion could have been caused, it is suggested, because, at the relevant time, the public had no way of knowing that S.C. Johnson had any interest in NEUTRA-FRESH and because, as far as the public was aware, there were two suppliers of NEUTRA-FRESH in the market. Knight was one and Belmar was the other.", "[22] Public attention was first directed to Reckitt & Colman's products on August 19, 1994. This is the date for the analysis of S.C. Johnson's claim. S.C. Johnson must establish that the trademark NEUTRA-FRESH was distinctive on August 19, 1994. Several issues arise in this context: 1. Had Knight's modest sales established a sufficient reputation for the product in Canada to support a claim under the Act 2. If not, had anything changed by reason of S.C. Johnson's acquisition of Knight's rights on July 29, 1994 to make NEUTRA FRESH distinctive by August 19, 1994? 3. Was NEUTRA-FRESH sufficiently distinctive on August 19, 1994 to support a prima facie case given the marketing of NEUTRA-FRESH air fresheners by Belmar in the 4 1/2 month period prior to August 19, 1994?", "[23] S.C. Johnson made reference to a number of cases in support of the distinctiveness of the NEUTRA-FRESH mark. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 60, at pp. 67-68 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 697 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 558, at pp. 567-568 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 433, at p. 451 (C.A.).) However, they were either cases in which the plaintiff's long term use of a trademark in Canada or in a foreign market had created a reputation for the trademark with the public or cases in which the plaintiff, in a shorter time frame, had undertaken extensive promotion or had made significant sales in association with a new trademark.", "[24] S.C. Johnson must establish that the trademark NEUTRA-FRESH has a reputation in the mind of the general public with respect to air fresheners and that NEUTRA-FRESH is recognized as being distinctive of one source (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 321; 44 C.P.R.(3d) 289, at p. 297). However, in order to establish this distinctiveness, it is not necessary for S.C. Johnson to prove that the public believes that the sole source of the NEUTRA-FRESH air freshener is specifically the plaintiff (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 1, at pp. 7-9). On the other hand, S.C. Johnson must establish that, as of August 19, 1994, the trademark NEUTRA-FRESH was used in association with air fresheners which were manufactured or supplied by only one trade source (see CIBA-Geigy at p. 297).", "[25] I have a concern about whether Knight developed sufficient goodwill in the NEUTRA-FRESH trademark to support a prima facie case under the Act . The mere acknowledgment that some goodwill existed by reason of S.C. Johnson's acquisition of goodwill does not establish that the trademark was sufficiently distinctive to support a passing-off action. Knight sold only four hundred and fifty retail units of NEUTRA-FRESH per year in Canada over four years. This amounts to national sales of less than 40 units per month at the wholesale level. In my view, even if I assume that all the units were resold to members of the public, this sales record is minimal to the point of being insignificant.", "[26] I am also concerned because, in the short period from its acquisition of Knight's rights on July 29, 1994 to the relevant date of August 19, 1994, S.C. Johnson had little opportunity to augment NEUTRA-FRESH's reputation with the public. The evidence discloses that S.C. Johnson introduced NEUTRA-FRESH to its sales force and trade customers in mid-July 1994. There is also evidence, for which specific dates are not given, to the effect that 500 information sheets and samples were distributed along with coupons and promotional premiums; that sales meetings were held with major accounts; that listings were obtained for NEUTRA-FRESH products with approximately 31 retail accounts; that 74 purchase orders were placed and that 18,000 cases of products were shipped to Canadian warehouses to fill the orders. Finally, media advertising was being developed. There is no doubt that S.C. Johnson was poised for entry and on the brink of establishing a significant reputation for the NEUTRA-FRESH trademark, but I am not persuaded that, at August 19, 1994, S.C. Johnson's actions had created a sufficient reputation for NEUTRA-FRESH with the public to support a prima facie case in an action for passing-off. I have reached this conclusion because there was no promotion to the public and the products were not displayed or offered for sale at the retail level prior to August 19, 1994. It is important to note that NEUTRA-FRESH was not a new trademark in S.C. Johnson's hands. For this reason, I have not adopted the reasoning of Rouleau J. in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 60, at pp. 67-68 (T.D.). In that case he granted an injunction based on the development of the distinctiveness of a new trademark in the wholesale market. In my view, when a trademark is not new and is used in association with a retail product, distinctiveness must be examined from the perspective of the retail purchasers. In this case, S.C. Johnson had no opportunity by August 19th to take the steps that would have developed a distinctiveness for NEUTRA-FRESH in the eyes of the general public.", "[27] On the other hand, at August 19, 1994, Belmar had a strong, albeit relatively short, sales record. Through its distributor it had sold approximately 1,600 retail units of NEUTRA-FRESH air freshener per month since April of 1994. Those units appeared on the shelves of individual hardware, paint, drug, lumber, grocery, pet, department, and automotive stores. In addition, NEUTRA-FRESH products were distributed to mass marketing chains who, in turn, sold them for resale by independent retailers including drug store chains with dozens of retail outlets, paint and hardware chains with about 60 retail outlets, lumber and hardware chains each with about seven retail outlets, health food store chains with hundreds of outlets and fast food store chains each with approximately 10 retail outlets.", "[28] Belmar's distributor actively promoted the retail sale of NEUTRA-FRESH air fresheners across Canada. Promotional brochures were used across the country. Sixty-five cardboard in-store display units were filled with Belmar's NEUTRA-FRESH air freshener and were placed in high volume retail outlets in Ontario. In May of 1994, Belmar's NEUTRA-FRESH air freshener was featured on a programme on City TV in Toronto. City TV advised Belmar that the programme was viewed by approximately 400,000 people in Southern Ontario.", "[29] There is no doubt that Belmar's air freshener did not receive the type of national \"saturation\" marketing that Reckitt & Colman provided for its NEUTRA AIR products. Nevertheless, Belmar's NEUTRA-FRESH air freshener was actively promoted to the public and had achieved meaningful retail exposure by August 19, 1994. I have therefore concluded that the trademark NEUTRA-FRESH was distinctive of Belmar's air freshener as of August 19, 1994. I have also concluded that the public would have viewed Belmar as the sole supplier of the product or at least would have identified only one supplier in connection with the NEUTRA-FRESH trademark. Knight's national sales were so minimal that, for all practical purposes, it had no market presence.", "[30] For this reason, I find that S.C. Johnson has established a prima facie case of passing-off. I am satisfied that the necessary goodwill exists in the trademark NEUTRA-FRESH, that deception of the public is inevitable as the two trademarks are admitted to be confusing and that S.C. Johnson, as the present owner of Belmar's rights in the NEUTRA-FRESH trademark, is likely to suffer damage by reason of the marketing by Reckitt & Colman of NEUTRA AIR products. Irreparable Harm", "[31] Both parties have agreed to keep the necessary records and both are in a position to pay damages. The issue therefore is whether damages are an adequate remedy for S.C. Johnson if Reckitt & Colman continues to market its NEUTRA AIR products and S.C. Johnson is successful at trial. S.C. Johnson's principal allegation of irreparable harm is based on the belief that, because NEUTRA-FRESH and NEUTRA AIR are admittedly confusing, the continued national \"saturation\" marketing of NEUTRA AIR until trial will overwhelm the limited and non-competitive marketing of NEUTRA-FRESH by Knight under its licence from S.C. Johnson. It is alleged that Reckitt & Colman's marketing of NEUTRA AIR will destroy the distinctiveness of NEUTRA-FRESH. Without the injunction, if S.C. Johnson wins at trial, it will achieve a hollow victory as NEUTRA-FRESH will no longer be a commercially viable trademark.", "[32] The Federal Court of Appeal has made it clear that the unauthorized use of a registered trademark does not per se result in irreparable harm to the owner of the mark. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 129 (F.C.A.), at 137, application for leave dismissed [1991] 3 S.C.R. xi; 137 N.R. 391). By analogy, it can be said that the use of a confusing mark will not necessarily cause irreparable harm by reason of a loss of distinctiveness. However, on the facts of this case, with saturation marketing to the general public of a confusing mark, there is no question in my mind that the distinctiveness of NEUTRA-FRESH will be lost without the injunction. Accordingly, the plaintiffs have established the irreparable harm necessary to support their application. Balance Of Convenience", "[33] If the injunction is granted it will not maintain the status quo as of the hearing date. Instead Reckitt & Colman will be required to terminate the newly established marketing programme for its NEUTRA AIR products. The inconvenience will be considerable but it will also be manageable because repackaged replacement products can be brought to market and because the related costs will be compensable. Reckitt & Colman states that it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is granted because it will lose the advantage it gained by being an innovator in Canada. This argument is not compelling. In my view, for all practical purposes, Belmar was the innovator in Canada. Reckitt & Colman also argues that its reputation will be harmed if the injunction is granted. There is no doubt that Reckitt & Colman will suffer some commercial embarrassment by reason of the injunction, but I am not persuaded that it will be grave or will in any way hamper the introduction of repackaged odour neutralizing air fresheners.", "[34] The fact remains that, if S.C. Johnson is successful at trial, NEUTRA-FRESH will not be a viable trademark without the injunction. To me this fact outweighs any inconvenience Reckitt & Colman may experience. The injunction will therefore be granted because, without the injunction, the plaintiffs' trademark rights will be forfeited. Conclusion", "[35] An order will be made granting S.C. Johnson's application for an interlocutory injunction. Application allowed. Editor: Gary W. MacLaughlin/slm [End of document]"]}

{"id_": "074115", "body_str": ["[1] McVeigh, J. : This is an application for judicial review of a Passport Canada decision dated October 11, 2013, that revoked Ryan Desmond De Hoedt's (the Applicant, or Ryan) passport from April 25, 2013 until April 25, 2018. The Director of Investigations Division Passport Program Integrity Branch (the Director) revoked the passport when they found that the Applicant committed an indictable offence outside of Canada by facilitating or aiding the entry of his sister without proper documentation into Canada, contrary to s. 117 of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , SC 2001, c 27 (the IRPA). I. Issues", "[2] The issues are: A. Were the procedural fairness requirements met? B. Did the decision maker have the jurisdiction to make the decision he made? C. Was the decision reasonable? II. Standard of Review", "[3] The standard of review is reasonable for the decision and is correctness for the procedural fairness issue ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). III. Legislative Context", "[4] The Canadian Passport Order , S1/81-86 (the Order), sections 9 & 10 (attached as Appendix A), is the legislation that the Director relied on to make the decision. The decision to revoke the passport was made pursuant to subparagraph 10(2)(b). That section states that revocation of the passport can occur if the applicant commits any offence in a foreign country, and that if it was done in Canada would be an indictable offence. Other sections apply where there are actual charges laid or convictions. IV. Facts", "[5] The Applicant is a Canadian citizen originally from Sri Lanka. He was employed as a flight attendant with WestJet until this situation occurred. This story begins when Ryan says his sister, a Sri Lankan citizen, called him from Sri Lanka wanting help. Ryan said his sister told him her life was in danger in Sri Lanka as she was running from the police so she needed him to come and help her. Ryan flew to Malaysia to assist his sister and says he thought he was taking her back to Sri Lanka, but when he arrived in Malaysia a hired agent threatened him and told him to fly to Laos to meet her. Ryan's evidence is that in Malaysia he learned she had a fake Canadian passport and that the plan was to return to Canada via Seoul, Korea and Tokyo, Japan.", "[6] Ryan said the hired agent assisted his sister to check in at Laos airport to fly to Korea and provided her with a passport to travel on. Ryan flew from Laos to Korea on the same flight as his sister and says the hired agent destroyed the sister's Sri Lankan passport and gave her the fake Canadian passport. Their flight from Korea arrived at Tokyo, Narieta Airport on April 25, 2013. Ryan went with his sister to the Air Canada counter to try and obtain a boarding pass for her flight to Canada. By his own admission, he had knowledge the passport was fake when he tried to get a boarding pass for his sister in Tokyo.", "[7] The Air Canada ticket agent staff reported the suspicious passport to the officials after Ryan tried to convince officials of the passport's authenticity and gave explanations including that maybe it was because she previously had the passport in her married name. Additional verifications by officials in Tokyo revealed the sister's passport was fake and his was real.", "[8] Ryan and his sister were detained in Tokyo and because the flight to Calgary had already departed he was flown to Vancouver. In Vancouver, after being interviewed by CBSA officials they confirmed his passport was valid. His sister was deported from Japan back to Sri Lanka.", "[9] Ryan has provided slightly different stories to officials in Tokyo and to officials in Canada. But there is no disagreement that by the time Ryan and his sister reached Tokyo he knew she was using a fake passport and he used the fake passport to try to get her a boarding pass to fly to Canada.", "[10] Ryan's legal counsel provided written submissions to the Director on September 11, 2013, after all of the information regarding the investigation was disclosed.", "[11] Ryan says his actions were not a deliberate plan to facilitate his sister's illegal entry into Canada but his deceit was to protect her and that the humanitarian motive is an important overriding factor in this case. V. Preliminary Issue", "[12] The Respondent has pointed out that there is evidence in the Applicant's affidavit in paragraphs 3, 4, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 that was not before the decision maker. The Federal Court of Appeal has held that it is not for me to reweigh or re-decide the merits on the facts and therefore I will disregard the evidence that was not before the decision maker ( Assn of Universities and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). VI. Analysis A. Were the Procedural Fairness Requirements met?", "[13] Ryan argues that the decision is not reasonable as the reasons were vague and the specific offence that he was found to have committed is not identified by the section number in the reasons. The Applicant said that until the judicial review he did not know the exact offence that he was found to have committed. The Applicant only found out what offence he had committed when the Respondent presented evidence for the judicial review application.", "[14] In the materials filed by the Respondent (Affidavit of Donald Closs) it states that the Director relied on section 117 of the IRPA (section 117, attached as Appendix B) as the underlying basis to support its actions under subparagraph 10(2)(b) of the Order. The Director stated the offence in this case was \"attempting to facilitate the illegal travel to Canada of an improperly documented individual\". The Applicant argues that failing to inform the individual of what the specific offence was is a breach of procedural fairness.", "[15] The Respondent submitted that not stating the exact section of the act is not fatal as the elements were set out and the Applicant had the ability to answer the allegations and respond. The Respondent says the Applicant was represented by counsel and did file submissions after receiving full disclosure so there was no breach of procedural fairness.", "[16] I am assisted by jurisprudence of this court that considered the procedural requirements in the context of a passport revocation.", "[17] Justice Simon Noël found in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( Kamel ), that it was sufficient if the applicant is provided with disclosure of the facts alleged and the information collected in the course of the investigation and then the applicant is given an opportunity to respond. I agree and in this case the Applicant was provided with all of the disclosure and then with assistance of counsel provided a response. This response was considered by the decision maker.", "[18] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), Justice Mary J.L. Gleason found in the cases before her that there was a breach as some but not all the material concerning the allegations was provided to the applicants. She found that the applicants needed to be given the opportunity to respond before the decision maker can make a decision.", "[19] On these facts unlike in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , all the material facts of the investigation were given to the Applicant so they could make a full answer.", "[20] Justice Michael L. Phelan in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) (Notice of Appeal filed February 18, 2014), found that not identifying the section in the decision was unreasonable as the Director only said that the applicant misused his passport and that is not an indictable offence.", "[21] The facts in this case are distinguishable from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. The Director did not identify the exact section but did state what the offence was and the facts used when the Director found Ryan had committed the offence. The Director on our facts wrote \"...while travelling on Passport---- (removed for privacy) you were attempting to facilitate the illegal travel to Canada of an improperly documented individual ...\"", "[22] I adopt the reasoning in Kamel and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, and I find no breach of the principles of natural justice as Ryan was given an opportunity to respond to all of the facts gathered in the investigation, and he did respond. The Director considered Ryan's submissions before the decision was made. On these facts there is no disagreement he tried to use the fake passport to aid his sister in entering Canada illegally.", "[23] In some factual situations it would be a breach by the Director not to have named the section in the reasons but in this case I find all procedural fairness requirements were met and that the reasons are not vague. It would of course have been preferable if the actual number of the section had been used by the Director but it is not fatal in this case. B. Did the Decision Maker have the Jurisdiction to make the Decision he made? (1) Jurisdiction and section 117 of the IRPA", "[24] The Applicant argues the Director did not have the jurisdiction to decide that he had committed an indictable offence. The Applicant argues that the Director used the word \"facilitating\" in the decision and that that word is not even referenced to in s. 117.", "[25] The Applicant says it is clear he was accompanying his sister to get her to Canada to seek refuge and that this is laudable goal. Ryan argues that this compassionate motive should be a heavily weighted factor and should out weigh what he did. Further he states that she independently obtained the fake passport by hiring an agent and that he had nothing to do with obtaining the fake passport. His position is that revoking his passport when he did not organize this ill conceived plan would be an injustice and it goes against the principles of natural justice. He submitted that Canada does not impose penalties for refugees entering illegally and relies on R v Appulonappa , 2013 BCSC 31, for support that s. 117 is overbroad and infringes section 7 of the , 1982 (Charter Rights), when this sanction is imposed when the motive is humanitarian.", "[26] The British Columbia Court of Appeal (BCCA) in R v Appulonappa, 2014 BCCA 163, since the Applicant's written argument and before the hearing, has overturned the trial division decision that was argued in the written submissions and leave has been granted to the SCC ([2014] SCCA No 283). The BCCA head notes says: The s. 117 offence is directed to Parliament's historical domestic concern with border control by preventing individuals from arranging the unlawful entry of undocumented migrants into Canada. The record does not support the respondents' contention that Parliament intended to exempt those acting through altruistic motives from prosecution under s. 117. Nor do the international instruments under consideration produce that result. The broad scope of the offence is thus aligned with its legislative objective, and the offence is not overbroad.", "[27] The BCCA is not binding but I find the analysis helpful. In R v Appulonappa at paragraphs 64-65, the BCCA relied on the Federal Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> leave to appeal to the SCC granted (2014 Can 18477), when it said that s. 117 has four elements being:", "[64] ...the person being smuggled did not have the required documents to enter Canada; the person was coming into Canada; the accused organized, induced, aided or abetted the person to enter Canada; and the accused knew the person lacked the required documents for entry ....", "[65] Motive is not a constituent element of the offence. It is relevant only as an aggravating factor for the purpose of sentencing ...", "[28] On our facts the four elements were present so the Director found Ryan committed the offence. It does not matter that the Director used facilitated instead of \"organized, induced, aided or abetted\" as set out in section 117. Facilitate is a synonym for \"aid\", \"help\", \"make easy\" and \"assist\" so the element of the offence was met.", "[29] I agree with the BCCA that motive has no part in this determination. I find that the Director had the jurisdiction to make the decision that the Applicant committed the offence ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). C. Was the decision reasonable?", "[30] I find the decision is reasonable for the reasons set out in the paragraphs that follow.", "[31] Canada has an international obligation to keep the integrity of our passport system ( Kamel , above, at para 41). This is a very important aspect of security, and so that Canadians are able to continue to enjoy the benefits of maintaining this high level of compliance:", "[50] ...When dealing with passports, there are stringent standards approaching perfection that must be adhered too, in order to meet international requirements and thus ensure the unreserved confidence of the international community. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [32] The decision maker said that on a balance of probabilities, Ryan had committed an indictable crime of (facilitating) aiding or abetting in human smuggling by helping his sister either obtain or travel on a fake passport. Subparagraph 10(2)(b) uses \"committed\" whereas subsections 9(b)& (c), 10(2)(a) applies to individuals that were \"charged\", and subsection 9(e) is individuals that have been \"convicted\". These are all intentional use of the words and have very different legal meanings ( R v Barnier , [1980] SCJ No 33; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA)).", "[33] The use of the word \"committed\" rather than \"convicted\" or \"charged\" was the intent of Parliament when the section was drafted. Parliament wanted the Canadian decision maker to be able to make the determination if there was proof of the elements of the indictable offence and it was committed in a foreign country. The rational would seem to be that some foreign countries do not have the same legal processes as Canada and with this section we do not need to rely on foreign countries justice systems for a conviction of an equivalent offence ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).", "[34] I think the decision was reasonable as we have a flight attendant who by his job title is a sophisticated, knowledgeable individual when it comes to understanding the consequences of assisting someone with a fake passport. He knew the passport was fake. He assisted or facilitated his sister to try and enter Canada on a fake passport. Ryan was the one at the Air Canada check-in in Tokyo that attempted to obtain a boarding pass for his sister knowing it was a fake passport. It is reasonable that the board determined that he had committed a crime in a foreign country that was indictable if committed in Canada given the overwhelming evidence, most of which was provided by the Applicant.", "[35] This is a sad story for this individual as he is no longer employed as a flight attendant but Canadian officials cannot allow people to assist others to travel on fake passports no matter what the compassionate humanitarian motive may be.", "[36] I will dismiss this judicial review.", "[37] No costs are ordered as none were requested JUDGMENT", "[38] THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that 1. The application is dismissed with no costs. Application dismissed. Editor: Jana A. Andersen/vnh Canadian Passport Order , (SI/81-86) REFUSAL OF PASSPORTS AND REVOCATION 9.

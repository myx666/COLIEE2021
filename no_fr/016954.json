{"id_": "016954", "body_str": ["[1] Denault, J. [Translation]: The defendant Gordon Fairweather has filed a conditional appearance and objects to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in relation to himself.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[2] The plaintiff, a member of the Immigration and Refugee Board (\"the Board\") since September 1, 1988, performed quasi-judicial duties for the Board. He was appointed by the Governor-in-Council for a two-year term. On November 10, 1989, the defendant Fairweather, the Board's Chairman, summoned the plaintiff to his office and informed him that he would oppose the renewal of the plaintiff's term on September 1, 1990. In short, the plaintiff was put on the shelf. On October 16, 1990, he sued the defendants jointly for damages of one million dollars. The amounts in question are being claimed for defamation, loss of income and of future pension benefits, and loss of fringe benefits (insurance plan).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[3] Counsel for the defendants submits that this court lacks jurisdiction to hear a suit against the defendant Fairweather under s. 17(5)(b) of the Federal Court Act . She bases her argument, inter alia, on the Oag [see footnote 1], Holt [see footnote 2], Varnam [see footnote 3], Bradasch [see footnote 4] and Emery [see footnote 5] cases, which established in substance that s. 17(5)(b) does not grant the court jurisdiction to hear and determine an action against individual defendants, even if they are public servants being sued jointly with the federal Crown, when the claims against them are based on tortious liability and not on a federal statute. Since causes of action in tort do not derive from a body of federal law, they do not satisfy the tests laid down by the Supreme Court in the ITO [see footnote 6] case. The causes of action come from the provincial law of tortious liability and do not therefore, with respect to this defendant, fall within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court as restricted by the case law [see footnote 7].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[4] Counsel for the plaintiff objects to this motion and argues that the present action is based not solely on provincial law (art. 1053 of the Civil Code ) but on a corpus of federal law. According to him, the plaintiff and the defendant Fairweather were both appointed by the Governor-in-Council under the Immigration Act (R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2). The defendant Fairweather acted as Chairman and had been appointed to hold office for a term not exceeding seven years, while the plaintiff had the status of a temporary member appointed to hold office during good behaviour for a term not exceeding two years. The plaintiff submits that the act of the defendant Fairweather was in reality based on his dissatisfaction with certain decisions rendered by the plaintiff. He submits that the act constituted interference in the performance of the plaintiff's duties and an unlawful act presenting grounds for an action in damages. He regards these events and acts as containing elements that are tortious within the meaning of the common law and therefore form a part of the corpus of federal law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[5] I do not share this view. A careful analysis of the statement of claim shows that this is unquestionably an action in damages based on tortious or quasi-tortious events leading to the application of rules of the civil law. At this stage of the proceedings, it must be found that the facts have been proven. As they are written, paragraphs 10 through 33 are unquestionably intended to show that the objection of the defendant Fairweather to renewal of the plaintiff's term can be attributed to the manner in which the plaintiff performed his quasi-judicial duties. In this respect, this act by the Board's Chairman toward his colleague might be regarded as an act of interference subject to relief and punishable by damages payable by the defendant Fairweather. This will be decided at trial. It should be noted, however, that most of the other assertions against the defendant in the statement of claim relate to acts whose tortious or quasi-tortious nature must be decided in accordance with the rules of the Civil Code (paragraph 16, a note described as unacceptable and offensive: paragraph 19, abuse of power; paragraph 20, ploys to discredit him; paragraph 26, malicious and unlawful acts; paragraph 27, defamation). In my opinion, the acts being asserted against the defendant cannot in the present case, even if they were committed while performing duties assigned under a federal statute, serve as a basis for this court's jurisdiction in relation to this defendant. This case only satisfies the second of the tests established in the ITO case: \"an existing body of federal law which is essential to the disposition of the case and which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction\" (at p. 766). I agree fully with the words of McNair, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  defendants do not derive from an existing body of federal law governing liability in the context of providing a 'detailed statutory framework' sufficient to fasten liability on such defendants. The fact that the defendant Outerbridge was the chief executive officer charged with general supervision over the work and affairs of the National Parole Board is far too fragile a link on which to found jurisdiction against him in his individual capacity. Under the circumstances, I find that the causes of action asserted against the individual defendants are not attributable to any fountainhead source of federal law but rather, if they exist at all, are the emanations of provincial law relating to tortious liability.\" (Emphasis mine)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>", "[6] For these reasons, the objection of the defendant Fairweather to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court is allowed, and his name is deleted as a defendant to the action. Costs in the cause.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Order accordingly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Editor: Debra F.

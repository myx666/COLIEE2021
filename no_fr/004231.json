{"id_": "004231", "body_str": ["[1] Pinard, J. [Translation] : The issue here, pursuant to the order which I made in this matter on September 5, 1990, is strictly to decide the jurisdiction of this court, taking into account the written agreement between the parties involved, which is set out in the document dated July 31, 1990, and entitled \"Joint Agreement of Facts and Issues - pursuant to rule 485(1)\".", "[2] On July 23, 1980, the plaintiffs brought an action against the defendants for patent infringement. On July 20, 1989, judgment was finally given in favour of the plaintiffs, ordering the defendants accordingly to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of $760,000 with interest. Although this judgment is at present under appeal to the Appeal Division of this court, it is nonetheless enforceable.", "[3] The plaintiffs obtained a writ of fieri facias from the court in order to enforce the judgment, which writ was  made out against the defendants and by virtue of which the officer who carried out the seizure seized, among other property, the real property in issue. The objector, a third party who is not directly involved in the main action between the plaintiffs and the defendants, filed an objection to this seizure and execution against the real property, relying specifically on articles 597, 674 and 675 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec: more precisely, the objector argues that it purchased the real property that was seized in a bulk sale to it by one of the defendants under articles 1569a et seq. of the Civil Code of Quebec [see footnote 1]. The plaintiffs first contest the fact that the property in question was the subject of the bulk sale and, second, rely on article 1569c of the C.C., arguing that in any event this sale is null because the affidavit required by article 1569b of the C.C. did not state the names of the plaintiffs as creditors of the seller.", "[4] It is important here to decide the issues set out in paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of the document \"Joint Agreement of Facts and Issues - pursuant to rule 485(1)\" referred to above, and so essentially to consider whether the Federal Court of Canada has jurisdiction in respect of the enforcement of one of its judgments to consider an objection to a seizure and execution when such objection is made by a third party and is contested by the plaintiffs, who have executed the seizure, on the basis of Quebec civil law.", "[5] First, the objector argues that there is no such jurisdiction, on the ground that the real legal basis of the contestation of its objection lies in the validity of the sale of the property seized, which in its view involves only Quebec civil law. On the other hand, the plaintiffs who executed the seizure argue that this court has the necessary jurisdiction in order, in the context of proceedings for the enforcement of one of its judgments, to determine whether or not the property seized is within the estate of the  judgment debtor against whom the seizure was executed.", "[6] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 161, at pages 330 and 331 S.C.R., the Supreme Court of Canada, in reasons written by Wilson, J., described the test to be applied in order to determine whether a matter is properly before the Federal Court as follows: \"The essential requirements to support a finding of jurisdiction in the Federal Court have been set out and expanded upon by this court on a number of occasions. In ITO -  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , McIntyre, J., speaking for the majority and drawing primarily upon this court's judgments in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  seized of a matter, at p. 766: '1. There must be a statutory grant of jurisdiction by the federal Parliament. '2. There must be an existing body of federal law which is essential to the disposition of the case and which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction. '3. The law on which the case is based must be \"a law of Canada\" as the phrase is used in s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867.' \"This test is well-established as the one to be applied in every case where the jurisdiction of the Federal Court is in issue. \"While there is clearly an overlap between the second and third elements of the test for Federal Court jurisdiction, the second element, as I  understand it, requires a general body of federal law covering the area of the dispute, i.e., in this case the law relating to Indians and Indian interests in reserve lands, and the third element requires that the specific law which will be resolutive of the dispute be 'a law of Canada' within the meaning of s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867. No difficulty arises in meeting the third element of the test if the dispute is to be determined on the basis of an existing federal statute. As will be seen, problems can, however, arise if the law of Canada which is relied on is not federal legislation but so-called 'federal common law' or if federal law is not exclusively applicable to the issue in dispute.\"", "[7] In this case, I find that the court has jurisdiction to decide on the merits of the objection to the seizure and execution because of the fact that this objection was made in the context of the enforcement of a judgment rendered in an action for patent infringement in which the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada, and this is not disputed, entirely meets the test set out above which was imposed by the Supreme Court of Canada.", "[8] In this context, subsections 55(1) and 56(1), (3) and (4) of the Federal Court Act specifically confirm the extension of the court's jurisdiction to all proceedings relating to the full enforcement of its judgments. The relevant provisions state: \"55(1) The process of the court shall run throughout Canada, including its territorial waters, and any other place to which legislation enacted by the Parliament of Canada has been made applicable. \"56(1) In addition to any writs of execution or other process that are prescribed by the Rules for enforcement of its judgments or orders, the court may issue process against the person or the property of any party,  of the same tenor and effect as those that may be issued out of any of the superior courts of the province in which any judgment or order is to be executed; and where, by the law of that province, an order of a judge is required for the issue of any process, a judge of the court may make a similar order, as regards like process to issue out of the court. \"56(3) All writs of execution or other process against property, as well as those prescribed by the Rules as those hereinbefore authorized, shall, unless otherwise provided by the Rules, be executed, as regards the property liable to execution and the modes of seizure and sale, as nearly as possible in the same manner as the manner in which similar writs or process, issued out of the superior courts of the province in which the property to be seized is situated, are, by the law of that province, required to be executed; and such writs or process shall bind property in the same manner as such similar writs or process, and the rights of purchasers thereunder are the same as those of purchasers under such similar writs or process. \"56(4) Every claim made by any person to property seized under a writ of execution or other process issued out of the court, or to the proceeds of the sale of such property, shall, unless otherwise provided by the rules, be heard and disposed of as nearly as may be according to the procedure applicable to like claims to property seized under similar writs or process issued out of the courts of the province.\"", "[9] I therefore conclude that in a case where the Federal Court of Canada is recognized as having full jurisdiction, such jurisdiction is not automatically extinguished when judgment is given in the main action, but rather it subsists in any proceedings relating to the enforcement of that judgment. In my  view, to deny the court this right to determine, in the context of the forced enforcement of one of its judgments, whether the property seized is part of the estate of the judgment debtor, even if such determination requires consideration of the provisions of the Civil Code of the Province of Quebec, would constitute a serious hindrance to the exercise of the court's powers of enforcement, and would be manifestly contrary to the will of Parliament which, as is even clearer in the English version of s. 56(4) of the Federal Court Act, used the words: Every claim made by any person to property seized under a writ of execution ... of the court ... shall , ... be heard and disposed of as nearly as may be according to the procedure applicable to like claims to property seized under similar writs ... of the courts of the province.\" (Emphasis mine)", "[10] It appears clear to me that if the federal Parliament had intended, THEN, to leave questions relating to the determination of property rights exclusively to the courts of the provinces, it would not have thus permitted the Federal Court to decide the same questions provided that the applicable procedure before the courts of the provinces be followed as nearly as possible.", "[11] Accordingly, being of the opinion that this court has the necessary jurisdiction, I find that the questions in issue as set out in paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of the document \"Joint Agreement of Facts and Issues - pursuant to rule 485(1)\" in the record must be answered in the affirmative. An order will therefore go accordingly, and costs will be in the cause in respect of the contestation of the objection. Order accordingly.

The words 'bulk sale' within the meaning of this chapter, include and mean any sale or transfer of a stock in trade or of merchandise, made, directly or indirectly, outside the ordinary course of the seller's business, whether the sale or transfer comprises the whole or nearly the whole of such stock in trade or merchandise or whether it relates only to an interest in the affairs or business of the seller. \"Art. 1569b.

{"id_": "000981", "body_str": ["[1] Teitelbaum, J. : This is an appeal by the appellant, Chebli Chehade, to the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, from a decision of a Citizenship judge dated September 10, 1993, wherein the Citizenship judge determined that the appellant was unable to fulfil the conditions found under s. 5(1) of the Citizenship Act Act ) and more particularly s. 5(1)(c), has failed to establish that \"within the four years immediately preceding the date of his application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada ...\".", "[2] In the letter of decision, dated September 10, 1993, the Citizenship judge states: \"I found that you met all of the requirements for citizenship set out in the Citizenship Act , except for the requirement of residence. Under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act , an applicant is required to have accumulated at least three years or residence in Canada within the four years immediately preceding his or her application. \"According to the evidence in your file and presented to me at your hearing, your absences from Canada total more than one year in the four years preceding your application. In these circumstances, you had to satisfy me, in order to meet the residence requirements, that your absences from Canada, could be counted as a period of residence in Canada. \"Federal Court precedents require that, to establish residence, an individual must show, in mind and in fact, a centralization of his or her mode of living in Canada. If such residence is established, absences from Canada do not affect this residence, as long as it is demonstrated that the individual left for a temporary purpose only and maintained in Canada some real and tangible form of residence. \"From the documents contained in your file and given to me at your hearing, I noted the following facts. You arrived in Canada accompanied by your wife and children on July 13, 1989. You left Canada on August 14, 1989, for a business trip since you did not end your professional activities in your country of origin so as not to suffer any financial losses. \"In the questionnaire on residence, you declared that you took up residency at 335 Deguire Blvd., Apt. 312 in Ville St-Laurent, Qu√©bec and you signed a lease on July 26, 1989, for the apartment in question. You opened a bank account at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on July 28, 1989. You registered your children in schools of the Ste-Croix School Board and the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal for the school year 1989-90. You obtained a Quebec driver's licence that was issued on November 2, 1989, upon your return from your first trip abroad as a permanent resident. Also, you filed copies of your income tax returns for 1989, 1990, 1991. \"I concluded, after examining the documents on file and the information you gave me at your hearing, that between July 13, 1989, the date you arrived to Canada and August 14, 1989, the date that you left Canada on a business trip, you did not establish yourself in Canada for the simple reason that your time in Canada was too short to do so and that you did not establish particular ties with Canada, even though you left your family in Canada. In your letter you indicated that you returned to Canada at every opportunity to see your family and monitor the progress of the members of your family as well as to familiarize yourself with your adopted country. This declaration left me under the impression that your stays in Canada were simply visits to a country that you like and wish to know more than a country where you wish to put down roots and build a life and a future. \"According to a decision rendered by the Honorable Judge Muldoon rendered in Ottawa on March first, 1993 in the case of Abolghasem Pourghasemi , Judge Muldoon said: '(...) must first throw in their lot with Canadians by residing among Canadians, in Canada, during three of the preceding four years, in order to Canadianize themselves. It is not something one can do while abroad, for Canadian life and society exist only in Canada and nowhere else.' \"After reviewing the documents contained in your file and taking into consideration the facts that you presented at your hearing, I have concluded that your application for citizenship is premature since you do not meet the requirements for residence as stated in paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act . I therefore do not approve your application for citizenship.\"", "[3] In the matter of a citizenship appeal of Re Kerho (1988), 21 F.T.R. 180, I stated at page 184: \"A citizenship appeal is effectively a trial de novo. Mr. Justice Joyal in the matter of Moira Reid Calderwood , an appeal from a decision of a Citizenship judge states, on page 1 of his decision: 'I should observe that a citizenship appeal before this court is effectively a trial de novo. I have therefore the privilege of hearing and considering all the evidence before me as if the appellant's application was being heard for the first time.'\"", "[4] In that the hearing is effectively a trial de novo, the appellant and his son gave evidence. The appellant was not represented by an attorney. He was represented by a friend.", "[5] The appellant produced, as an exhibit, Exhibit A-1, which lists all of his absences from Canada from the date of his first coming to Canada on July 13, 1989, to the date of his citizenship application on August 17, 1992. It appears from Exhibit A-1 that the appellant was out of Canada for a total of 454 days.", "[6] The appellant is married and is the father of four children. The appellant's wife and children have been granted Canadian citizenship.", "[7] Soon after coming to Canada, the appellant leased a home for himself and his family. He first leased a home in Ville St-Laurent and then moved to Dollard Des Ormeaux where he presently resides with his family. The children were registered in school. I have no evidence that the appellant's wife was ever employed for remuneration. The appellant was the sole support of his family and he did this by carrying on business in the United Arab Emirates. The appellant states that he had made his trips for business to obtain funds from persons who allegedly owed him money. He states that he does no business in Canada because of the recession. He also states that the economy of the United Arab Emirates is stable and he is able to earn the funds he needs to support his family.", "[8] When asked by both myself and the amicus curiae as to what he did to become familiar with Canada and its culture, he stated that he visited Canada, two trips to Toronto and two trips to Niagara Falls, tours of Montreal and I believe he stated that he visited Quebec City. The appellant informed me that he belongs to no clubs and no associations. He did open two bank accounts, purchased a car, obtained a driver's license and purchased furniture for his home. He states that it is and was always his intention to make Canada his home.", "[9] In the citizenship appeal of Lo, Re (1993), 62 F.T.R. 131, T-1908-92 (T.D.), March 18, 1993, I quote Mr. Justice Muldoon in Pourghasemi, Re (1993), 62 F.T.R. 122 (T.D.) and state, on page 134: \"In Abolghasem Pourghasemi , unreported T-80-92, Mr. Justice Muldoon in stating the purpose of section 5(1)(c) in a situation where the appellant had only accumulated 357 days of residence in Canada when he needed 1,095 days in order to qualify states, at page 1 and 2, the following: 'In drawing a purposive interpretation of the statutory language it should be asked: Why did Parliament prescribe at least three years of Canadian residence in the four years immediately before applying for citizenship? 'It is clear that the purpose of paragraph 5(1)(c) is to ensure that everyone who is granted precious Canadian citizenship has become, or at least has been compulsorily presented with the everyday opportunity to become \"Canadianized\". This happens by \"rubbing elbows\" with Canadians in shopping malls, corner stores, libraries, concert halls, auto repair shops, pubs, cabarets, elevators, churches, synagogues, mosques and temples - in a word wherever one can meet and converse with Canadians - during the prescribed three years. One can observe Canadian society for all its virtues, decadence, values, dangers and freedoms, just as it is. That is little enough time in which to become Canadianized. If a citizenship candidate misses that qualifying experience, then Canadian citizenship can be conferred, in effect, on a person who is still a foreigner in experience, social adaptation, and often in thought and outlook. If the criterion be applied to some citizenship candidates, it ought to apply to all. So, indeed, it was applied by Madam Justice Reed in Re Koo , T-20-92, on December 3, 1992, in different factual circumstances, of course.' \"I am in total agreement with this statement of Mr. Justice Muldoon.\"", "[10] In the same Lo case, I state, at page 2: \"The reason for the Citizenship judge refusing the appellant's application is that the appellant is short 305 days of the required 1095 days. On page 2 of the decision, the Citizenship judge states: 'Mr. Lo, because you applied quite a few months after your three years were met, the court calculated that, in fact, you are only short 305 days of the required 1,095.' \"The Citizenship judge, having found that the appellant was 'only' short by 305 days, then goes on to state at page 4: 'I am going to refer to previous Federal Court of Appeal cases, such as the one of Mr. Justice A. Walsh involving: Re: Anita Leung (Bearing File #T-458-90) , where he stated: \"Many Canadian citizens, whether Canadian born or naturalized, must spend a large part of their time abroad in connection with their businesses and this is their choice. An applicant for citizenship, however, does not have such freedom because of the provisions of section 5(1) of the Act .\" 'Also, Mr. Justice Muldoon, involving (Bearing File T-1893-83) , where he stated: \"Parliament intended that the applicant for citizenship demonstrate that he or she has actually resided among Canadians and, in effect, thrown in his or her lot some Canadian community.\" 'It is very tempting to say that I should perhaps grant you citizenship at this time, so that you would be able to become a Canadian citizen at the same time as your wife, who has met all of the requirements of the Act , Mr. Lo. However, that would not be applying the law on the facts in your case. Your wife has remained in Canada and therefore, she is able to meet the requirements of 5(1)(c) \"Residence\", which unfortunately, you have not met. I have no option other than to non-approve your application for citizenship.'\"", "[11] I am satisfied that the appellant has failed to \"Canadianize\" himself notwithstanding that his family has done so. The appellant was absent from Canada for 454 days during the period when he was \"residing\" in Canada. He did not become a member of any \"community\". His work was and is not in Canada but in the United Arab Emirates and I am satisfied that that is where the appellant's work will be for at least the immediate future.", "[12] I understand the appellant's dilemma. On the one hand he must work to earn funds to support his family and this in the United Arab Emirates and at the same time to try to \"Canadianize\" himself to obtain his citizenship. It is a problem but Canadian citizenship, as Mr. Justice Muldoon states \"is precious\" and the appellant will simply have to make a greater effort.", "[13] Notwithstanding the fact that the appellant is a stateless person, I do not believe compassionate grounds exist for the awarding of citizenship nor do I believe that the appellant will suffer \"special and unusual hardship\" by his not obtaining his citizenship at the present time.", "[14] The appeal is denied. Appeal dismissed. Editor: Steven C. McMinniman/mjp [End of document]"]}

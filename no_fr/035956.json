{"id_": "035956", "body_str": ["[1] Rothstein, J. : This is a judicial review of a decision of adjudicator Lyle Moffatt and Immigration and Refugee Board member John Wieler dated May 25, 1992, which found that the applicant had no credible basis for a claim to refugee status.", "[2] There are three grounds asserted by counsel for the applicant on this judicial review. 1. That the applicant was denied adequate interpretation. 2. That the applicant was not given a fair hearing because he was denied reasonably effective assistance from counsel. 3. That the decision made by the credible basis tribunal involved the weighing of evidence rather than the proper assessment of whether there was any evidence of a credible basis for the applicant's refugee claim.", "[3] The applicant was born in Vietnam in 1963 and is a citizen of that country. He describes his ethnic group as Chinese.", "[4] The applicant says that his first language is Cantonese which is the language spoken at home by his family. Although he went to school in Vietnam from 1969 to 1978, he says his knowledge of Vietnamese is rudimentary. He further says that he can only speak and understand simple Vietnamese and cannot express his thoughts competently or properly in that language.", "[5] At the applicant's credible basis hearing, interpretation into and from Vietnamese was offered and accepted. The applicant states in his affidavit dated October 29, 1992: \"I was asked only if Vietnamese interpretation was acceptable to me.\" In the personal information form of the applicant completed on May 25, 1992, at page 9, the following question appears: \"Do you require the services of an interpreter for any proceedings before the refugee division? \"Language to be interpreted.\" The applicant ticked off \"yes\" in answer to the question as to whether an interpreter was required, but did not specify the language into which he desired to have the proceedings interpreted.", "[6] The interpreter's declaration states as follows: \"Nam Vu hereby certify that I have translated the complete contents of these nine (9) pages and all attached documents to the claimant from the English to the Vietnamese language. He/she has assured me that he/she fully understands the contents of these pages and all attached documents as translated.\"", "[7] Counsel for the applicant pointed to various portions of the transcript of the credible basis hearing which he says demonstrate that the claimant's story did not clearly come out. He further submits that the applicant has a right to be offered translation in his language of choice and this was not offered in this case. Reliance is placed on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).", "[8] I have reviewed the transcript of the credible basis hearing. While the transcript is not the model of perfection, as transcripts rarely are, especially when translation is involved, I cannot conclude that the relatively minor deficiencies to which counsel refers arise from the inability of the applicant to understand the translation to and from Vietnamese. Simply pointing out excerpts in which the claimant says he does not understand, does not, in my opinion, prove a failure of translation, especially where, following the identified excerpts, the issues are clarified.", "[9] I accept that an applicant is entitled to be offered translation in his or her language of choice. In this case the applicant says in his own affidavit that he was asked if Vietnamese interpretation was acceptable to him. At no place in the record is there an indication by the applicant or his counsel of an objection to Vietnamese or a preference for translation to or from any other language. The applicant's personal information form contains a certification by the interpreter that insofar as the translation of that form and its attachments are concerned, they were translated from English to Vietnamese and that the applicant assured the interpreter that he fully understood the contents of them. Indeed, the applicant was born in Vietnam and went to school there for some nine years.", "[10] The first time the inadequacy of translation was raised was in the applicant's affidavit in support of a motion for leave to seek judicial review over five months after the credible basis hearing and decision.", "[11] This is not a case such as <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in which an adjudicator proceeded without an interpreter although he was not satisfied that the applicant could understand and communicate sufficiently in English. Nor is this case in which it is alleged that the interpretation was incompetent as in Ming supra, or <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).", "[12] In the circumstances of this case, I can see no error of law pertaining to the question of interpretation.", "[13] Counsel on the judicial review says that the different counsel representing the applicant at the credible basis hearing was inadequate and that the applicant was denied reasonably effective assistance of counsel at that hearing. It is alleged that: 1. The claimant's story did not come out, that is, the entirety of the applicant's story was not told. 2. Counsel did not go over the personal information form of the applicant before the hearing and that it was completed at the hearing. 3. Counsel did not submit all the information available to him about conditions in Vietnam. 4. Counsel did not object to interpretation into Vietnamese. 5. Counsel misinterpreted the position of his client in argument. 6. Counsel had little or no familiarity with the refugee process. 7. Counsel failed to advise the claimant of the possibility of judicial review.", "[14] Counsel for the applicant relies on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.). In that case, counsel fell asleep on three occasions during a hearing. In adopting United States jurisprudence that, in a criminal case, if counsel for the accused sleeps during a substantial portion of the trial, such conduct is inherently prejudicial, MacGuigan, J.A., states at page 247: \"I would be prepared to adopt such a holding, but I would emphasize that in any case where it was applied it would have to be based on a very precise factual foundation. In Javor , for example the appellate court had the advantage of just such a factual finding by a United States magistrate.\"", "[15] No other jurisprudence of this court or of other Canadian courts was cited by counsel for the applicant on this point.", "[16] In my view, the facts in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , are quite extraordinary. While if it can be demonstrated that counsel slept during a proceeding, a party may not have been given reasonably effective assistance from counsel, I do not think the same conclusion may be drawn from the facts of this case. That the applicant's story was not told or did not come out clearly may have been a fault of counsel or it may have been that the applicant did not properly brief counsel. As I understand the circumstances, counsel was freely chosen by the applicant. If counsel did not adequately represent his client, that is a matter between client and counsel.", "[17] That the personal information form was not completed until the day of the hearing may have been due to a number of factors. The indication from the record is that it had largely been completed and only certain portions had been left to the day of the hearing. Apparently the applicant changed counsel and the documents were only sent over to counsel appearing at the credible basis hearing shortly before the hearing.", "[18] The material before me contained more information about conditions in Vietnam than was the case before the credible basis panel. However, some information before me antedated the credible basis hearing. Often, evidence of country conditions takes the form of nothing more than the United States Country Reports on Human Rights Practices as was the case here. I cannot conclude that the failure to file further evidence on country conditions demonstrates incompetence on the part of counsel.", "[19] While counsel did not object to interpretation between English and Vietnamese, nothing in the material before me suggests that his failure to do so was consistent with incompetency. As I stated earlier, the first time there was any indication of a failure of interpretation arose some five months after the credible basis hearing and decision. Nothing in the record otherwise discloses any difficulty that could be attributed only to the failure of interpretation.", "[20] According to counsel appearing before me, former counsel at the credible basis hearing misstated the applicant's position. However, I cannot determine from the material before me that the basis for former counsel's argument was not rooted in information provided to counsel by the applicant himself or that former counsel's argument was not, although unsuccessful, a determined strategy before the credible basis tribunal.", "[21] It may also be that counsel had little or no familiarity with the refugee process. However, this is not equivalent to incompetency. While it would be desirable that all litigants be represented by counsel who are both knowledgeable and experienced, I am not aware of any jurisprudence to the effect that if a tribunal or court proceeds with one or both parties represented by inexperienced counsel, that this constitutes an error of law.", "[22] Finally, it was submitted that counsel did not advise the applicant of his right to seek judicial review. Even if this is true, I cannot see how it assists the applicant. The failure of counsel to advise a client of all avenues of appeal can have no effect on the decision being appealed from.", "[23] The applicant may have other relief against counsel who represented him at the credible basis hearing. But on the question of representation by counsel, I cannot find that the credible basis tribunal committed an error of law in this case. It seems to me that in many cases unsuccessful litigants may wish to blame the result on the inadequacy of counsel. Where there is merit to such a claim, a client may be able to proceed against counsel and secure recovery. However, in my opinion, the failure of counsel, freely chosen by a client, cannot, in any but the most extraordinary case, result in an overturning of a decision on appeal or judicial review.", "[24] The final argument of counsel for the applicant is that the credible basis tribunal did not properly assess whether there was a credible basis to the applicant's refugee claim, but rather proceeded to weigh the evidence as to whether the applicant was indeed a refugee. The tribunal stated at page 18 of the transcript, after reviewing the evidence before it in some detail: \"In order to refer your claim to the Refugee Division the Panel must be able to find some evidence that relates to the elements of the Convention Refugee definition. Based on that evidence might the refugee division determine you to be a convention refugee. The panel has found no such evidence and will therefore, not be forwarding your claim to the Refugee Division.\" In my opinion, the credible basis tribunal correctly addressed itself to the issue it was to decide. Nothing in the review of the evidence suggests that it found any credible basis upon which to refer the applicant to the Refugee Division. That is a conclusion that the credible basis tribunal is entitled to reach. I find no error in the assessment or decision making process of the credible basis tribunal.", "[25] I would therefore dismiss this application for judicial review.", "[26] At the conclusion of the hearing before me, counsel for the applicant asked that I consider certifying the following questions pursuant to s. 83(1) of the Immigration Act to enable an appeal to be taken to the Federal Court of Appeal: 1. Is there a duty to question a person and receive an answer on the language that they need? 2. Does the question of reasonably effective assistance of counsel arise from the manner in which counsel presented the case? 3. In the credible basis decision, is it an error of law to use the language and standards of credibility when the applicant is himself believed.", "[27] I have considered the questions which counsel has requested that I certify. In my view, they are not questions of general importance or do not arise on the facts of this case. I therefore decline to certify the questions as requested. Application dismissed. Editor: Steven C.

Barnes, J.
: This Application having come before the Court for argument on June 6, 2007, and upon hearing counsel for the parties.
JUDGMENT
[2]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
this application is dismissed for the following reasons:
1. This application arises out of an administrative decision refusing to defer the removal of the Applicants from Canada made in July of 2006. That decision was stayed by Order of this Court on August 2, 2006. By the time this application came before the Court, the serious issues identified in the stay decision were, in practical terms, academic. This case is on all fours with the decision of Justice Frederick Gibson in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2007 FC 377 where a similar application was dismissed on the ground of mootness. I would resolve this application on the same basis.

 Summary: 
 
 Ferri was a permanent resident of Canada. He had an extensive criminal record and he was subject to a deportation order, which had been stayed by the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board. Ferri was convicted of possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking and the Minister applied to cancel his stay and terminate his appeal due to the operation of s. 68(4) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). Ferri served a Notice of Constitutional Question, alleging that s. 68(4) of IRPA violated ss. 7 and 15 of the Charter. The IAD held that s. 68(4) expressly deprived the IAD of the power to decide questions of law, including constitutionality, and it therefore did not have jurisdiction to consider Ferri's Charter challenge. The stay was cancelled and Ferri's appeal was terminated. Ferri applied for judicial review of the IAD's decision that it did not have jurisdiction to consider his Charter challenge.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court dismissed the application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 This application was heard on November 1, 2005, at Toronto, Ontario, before Mactavish, J., of the Federal Court, who delivered the following decision on November 22, 2005.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>                                                                                                        <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] 
   
 Mactavish, J. 
 : The issue in this application is whether the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board has the jurisdiction to consider a challenge to the constitutionality of s. 68(4) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
  under ss. 7 and 15 of the  
 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  For the reasons that follow, I find that the effect of s. 68(4) of  
 IRPA 
  is to deprive the IAD of jurisdiction to decide questions of law, including questions of constitutional validity. As a consequence, Mr. Ferri's application for judicial review is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Background  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Loreto Lorenzo Ferri is an Italian citizen who has been in Canada since he was 11 years old. He is a permanent resident in this country. As a result of his extensive criminal record, Mr. Ferri has been subject to a deportation order since 1995, although his deportation was stayed by order of the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board on several conditions. The stay was renewed from time to time, with the most recent order staying Mr. Ferri's deportation set to expire in December of 2002.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  As a result of Mr. Ferri having been convicted of possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking, the Minister applied to cancel his stay, and terminate his appeal, due to the operation of s. 68(4) of  
 IRPA 
 . This subsection provides that where the IAD has stayed a removal order involving a permanent resident who had been found to be inadmissible on the basis of serious criminality or criminality, and the individual is convicted of another serious offence, the individual's stay is cancelled by operation of law, and the appeal terminated.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  It is common ground that Mr. Ferri's narcotics conviction brings him within the provisions of s. 68(4).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  Prior to the hearing of the Minister's application to cancel Mr. Ferri's stay and terminate his appeal, Mr. Ferri served a Notice of Constitutional Question, alleging that s. 68(4) of  
 IRPA 
  violates s. 7 and 15 of the  
 Charter 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The IAD's Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  In a decision dated November 2, 2004, the IAD held that it did not have the requisite jurisdiction to consider Mr. Ferri's  
 Charter 
  challenge.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The Board noted that s. 162(1) of  
 IRPA 
  gives it the power to consider all questions of law, including questions of jurisdiction. As a result of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the IAD is thus presumed to have jurisdiction to decide constitutional questions, unless Parliament has either expressly, or impliedly, removed that power from the tribunal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  The IAD found that this presumption is rebutted in this case by the wording of s. 68(4) of  
 IRPA 
 , which, it says, expressly deprives the IAD of the power to decide questions of law, including constitutionality.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  According to the IAD, the effect of s. 68(4) is to limit the jurisdiction of the IAD to determining whether the factual requirements of the subsection are met. That is, the IAD can only consider whether it has previously stayed a removal order; whether the individual in question is a permanent resident or foreign national who was found inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality or criminality; and whether the individual has been convicted of another offence coming within s. 36(1) of  
 IRPA 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  The IAD concluded that once it determines that the factual requirements of the subsection have been met, it then loses jurisdiction over the individual, by operation of law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  As a consequence, the IAD refused to entertain Mr. Ferri's constitutional challenge, the stay was cancelled, and his appeal terminated.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Issue  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The only issue in this case is whether the IAD erred in deciding that it did not have the jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of s. 68(4). No challenge to the constitutionality of the legislation itself is presently before this Court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Neither party addressed the issue of the appropriate standard of review in their submissions. I am satisfied that a question as to the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal to decide a question as to the constitutionality of a provision in its enabling legislation must be reviewed against a standard of correctness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Relevant Statutory Provisions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The following provisions of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
  are in issue in this case:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "3(3) This Act is to be construed and applied in a manner that  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) ensures that decisions taken under this Act are consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including its principles of equality and freedom from discrimination and of the equality of English and French as the official languages of Canada;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "36(1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality for  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) having been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years, or of an offence under an Act of Parliament for which a term of imprisonment of more than six months has been imposed;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) having been convicted of an offence outside Canada that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years; or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) committing an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place where it was committed and that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "64(1) No appeal may be made to the Immigration Appeal Division by a foreign national or their sponsor or by a permanent resident if the foreign national or permanent resident has been found to be inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(2) For the purpose of subsection (1), serious criminality must be with respect to a crime that was punished in Canada by a term of imprisonment of at least two years.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "68(4) If the Immigration Appeal Division has stayed a removal order against a permanent resident or a foreign national who was found inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality or criminality, and they are convicted of another offence referred to in subsection 36(1), the stay is cancelled by operation of law and the appeal is terminated.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 The Jurisprudence Relating to the Charter Jurisdiction of Administrative Tribunals  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  The jurisprudence governing the power of administrative tribunals to apply the provisions of the  
 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
  has undergone a significant evolution in the last 15 years.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  The issue was first addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in a trilogy of cases decided in the early 1990's: see  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 271, and  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . These cases emphasized the compelling policy considerations favouring the jurisdiction of administrative tribunals to determine the constitutionality of their enabling legislation. These policy considerations include the principle that invalid laws should not be applied, whether by the Courts or administrative tribunals, as well as the principle that Canadians should be able to assert their rights in the most accessible forum available.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  The Court also felt that there was a benefit to be derived by having constitutional questions determined in the first instance in the environment in which the legislation operates. The informed opinion of expert tribunals was felt to be of assistance to the Courts that would ultimately be called upon to decide these issues.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  This ability of administrative tribunals to decide constitutional questions was not viewed by the Supreme Court as usurping the role of the Courts as final arbiters of constitutionality, as tribunal decisions would always be reviewed against a standard of correctness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Some five years later, the Supreme Court revisited the trilogy in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In  
 Cooper 
 , the Court appeared to retreat somewhat from its initial position, by applying the trilogy somewhat narrowly. According to  
 Cooper 
 , administrative tribunals will not automatically have the power to deal with  
 Charter 
  challenges to their enabling legislation. Such jurisdiction would only be found to exist where the tribunal's enabling legislation either expressly or by implication conferred the power on the tribunal in issue to decide such questions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  In determining whether an administrative tribunal implicitly had the power to decide questions of constitutionality, it will be necessary to conduct a pragmatic and functional analysis of the tribunal and its jurisdiction. Consideration would have to be given to factors such as whether the tribunal had the power to determine questions of law, as well as to various practical matters, including the composition and structure of the tribunal, the procedure before the tribunal, the appeal route from the tribunal, and the expertise of the tribunal. At the same time, the Supreme Court observed that there could be pragmatic and functional policy concerns that argue for or against the tribunal having constitutional competence, while, at the same time, observing that such concerns will never supplant the intention of the legislature.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  In a strong dissent, Justices McLachlin and L'Heureux-Dubé clearly viewed the majority decision in  
 Cooper 
  as representing a significant retreat from the position originally espoused by the Supreme Court in the trilogy. In advocating greater latitude for administrative tribunals to apply the  
 Charter 
 , Justice McLachlin wrote that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The  
 Charter 
  is not some holy grail which only judicial initiates of the superior courts may touch. The  
 Charter 
  belongs to the people. All law and law-makers that touch the people must conform to it. Tribunals and commissions charged with deciding legal issues are no exception. Many more citizens have their rights determined by these tribunals than by the courts. If the  
 Charter 
  is to be meaningful to ordinary people, then it must find its expression in the decisions of these tribunals. [¶ 70] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [23] 
  In 2003, the Supreme Court revisited the issue yet again in the  
 Martin 
  decision previously cited, with the Court reappraising and restating the rules concerning the jurisdiction of administrative tribunals to apply the  
 Charter 
 .  
 Martin 
  identifies a series of factors that must be considered in determining whether a particular tribunal has the jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of its enabling legislation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  In answering this question,  
 Martin 
  teaches that one must look first to whether the administrative tribunal has the express or implied jurisdiction to decide questions of law arising under the challenged provision. Explicit jurisdiction must be found in the terms of the statutory grant of authority, whereas implied jurisdiction must be found by looking at the statute as a whole. Relevant factors in this regard will include the statutory mandate of the tribunal in issue, and whether deciding questions of law is necessary for the effective fulfilment of this mandate; the interaction of the tribunal in question with other elements of the administrative system; whether the tribunal is adjudicative in nature; and practical considerations, including the tribunal's capacity to consider questions of law. In relation to this last point, the Supreme Court was clear that practical considerations, cannot, however, override a clear implication from the statute itself.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Where a tribunal is found to have the jurisdiction to decide questions of law arising under a legislative provision, this power will be presumed to include jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of that provision under the  
 Charter 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  Finally, where a party asserts that a tribunal lacks jurisdiction to apply the  
 Charter 
 ,  
 Martin 
  establishes that the burden will be on that party to rebut the presumption in favour of  
 Charter 
  competence. This presumption may be rebutted by demonstrating either that there has been an explicit withdrawal of authority to consider the  
 Charter 
 , or that an examination of the statutory scheme clearly leads to the conclusion that the legislature intended to exclude the  
 Charter 
  (or a category of questions such as constitutional questions generally) from the scope of the questions of law to be addressed by the tribunal. In this regard, the Supreme Court observed that such an implication should normally arise from the terms of the statute itself, as opposed to external considerations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  How then do these principles apply in this case?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Mr. Ferri's Position  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  In support of his contention that the IAD has the necessary jurisdiction to entertain his  
 Charter 
  challenge, Mr. Ferri points to s. 162(1) of  
 IRPA 
 , which empowers the IAD to determine all questions of law, including questions of jurisdiction, in dealing with matters before it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  Moreover, Mr. Ferri says, the  
 Martin 
  decision is clear that a party should be able to assert his or her  
 Charter 
  rights in the most accessible forum, which, in this case, is the IAD.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  Mr. Ferri submits that the decision of this Court in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 252 F.T.R. 257; 2004 FC 697, which held that the IAD lacks the power to decide the constitutionality of s. 64 of  
 IRPA 
 , is distinguishable from the present case. In this regard, Mr. Ferri observes that while both s. 64 and s. 68(1) of the  
 Act 
  limit the jurisdiction of the IAD, under s. 64, the IAD is precluded from asserting jurisdiction over an individual from the outset, whereas cases coming under s. 68(1) of the  
 Act 
  involve situations where the IAD has already assumed jurisdiction over a person, having previously stayed the individual's removal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  Further, given that the IAD has sole and exclusive jurisdiction over matters falling within s. 68(1) of  
 IRPA 
 , Mr. Ferri says that there is no other forum in which he could challenge the constitutional validity of the provision in question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  A review of the statutory scheme as a whole also militates in favour of the IAD having  
 Charter 
  competence under s. 68(1), Mr. Ferri says. In addition to s. 162(1) conferring the power on the IAD to decide questions of law, Mr. Ferri points to paragraph 3(3)(d) of  
 IRPA 
 , which requires that the  
 Act 
  be construed in a manner that ensures that decisions taken under the  
 Act 
  are taken in a manner that is consistent with the  
 Charter 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  Mr. Ferri also points to the fact that IAD hearings are adjudicative in nature, as well as the fact that the IAD can hear and receive the evidence that he wants to adduce in support of his constitutional challenge. Given that he is already before the IAD, it is, therefore, the most accessible forum for the determination of the constitutional issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  The combined effect of these factors is that the IAD's conclusion that it lacked the necessary jurisdiction to decide the constitutional issue was wrong, Mr. Ferri says. As a consequence, the decision should be set aside, and the matter remitted to the IAD for redetermination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  In light of the Supreme Court's ruling in  
 Martin 
 , the fact that s. 162(1) of  
 IRPA 
  empowers the IAD to determine all questions of law (including questions of jurisdiction) in dealing with matters before it, suggests that the IAD does indeed have the power to determine the constitutionality of s. 68(1) of the  
 Act 
 . Moreover, given that Mr. Ferri is already before the IAD, that tribunal is indeed the most accessible forum for him to mount his  
 Charter 
  challenge, further militating in favour of finding that the IAD has  
 Charter 
  jurisdiction in this case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  However,  
 Martin 
  also makes it clear that before the Court can look to these types of considerations in a jurisdictional analysis such as this, the first issue that has to be addressed is whether the tribunal in question has the express or implied jurisdiction to decide questions of law arising under the challenged provision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  Reference must thus be had to the wording of s. 68(4), which will be repeated here for ease of reference:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "68(4) If the Immigration Appeal Division has stayed a removal order against a permanent resident or a foreign national who was found inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality or criminality, and they are convicted of another offence referred to in subsection 36(1), the stay is cancelled by operation of law and the appeal is terminated. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
                                                                                                       <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "68(4) Le sursis de la mesure de renvoi pour interdiction de territoire pour grande criminalité ou criminalité est révoqué de plein droit si le résident permanent ou l'étranger est reconnu coupable d'une autre infraction mentionnée au paragraphe 36(1), l'appel étant dPs lors classé. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [38] 
  As was noted earlier, the parties agree that Mr. Ferri's situation falls squarely within this provision. The only question is whether the effect of the wording of the section is to deprive the IAD of jurisdiction to hear and decide Mr. Ferri's constitutional argument.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] 
  I am of the view that while the IAD may have a general power to decide questions of law and jurisdiction necessary for the resolution of cases coming before it, the effect of the wording of s. 68(4) is to expressly limit the jurisdiction of the IAD in relation to individuals in Mr. Ferri's situation to the determination of whether the facts of an individual case bring the appellant within the wording of the provision, thus rebutting the presumption in favour of  
 Charter 
  jurisdiction.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [40] 
  That is, the IAD's jurisdiction is limited to answering the following questions:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Is the individual in question a foreign national or permanent resident?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Has the individual previously been found to be inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality or criminality?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. Has the IAD previously stayed a removal order made in relation to that individual?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. Has the individual been convicted of another offence referred to in s. 36(1)?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [41] 
  If the answer to each of these questions is in the affirmative, as is admittedly the case here, then the section is clear: the IAD loses jurisdiction over the individual, with the stay being cancelled and the appeal being terminated by operation of law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [42] 
  While Mr. Ferri has advanced a number of arguments that would favour finding  
 Charter 
  jurisdiction in the IAD in cases such as this, these considerations cannot override the express wording of the statute. In this regard, the wording of s. 68(4) clearly reflects Parliament's intent to limit the jurisdiction of the IAD in cases such as this.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [43] 
  This interpretation is consistent with the fact that, in enacting the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
  in 2002, Parliament re-balanced the interests of public safety and individual rights by broadening the categories of persons who may be removed without an appeal to the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 318 N.R. 252 (F.C.A.), at ¶ 55, affd. [2005] S.C.J. No. 31; 339 N.R. 1; 2005 SCC 51. While  
 Medovarski 
  dealt with s. 64 of 
  IRPA 
 , I am of the view that this observation is equally applicable to the present case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [44] 
  As was noted previously, Justice Rouleau came to a similar conclusion in the  
 Kroon 
  case previously cited. While  
 Kroon 
  also dealt with s. 64 of  
 IRPA 
 , rather than s. 68(4), I am of the view that his reasoning is equally applicable in this case. The fact that s. 64 operates to prevent the IAD from assuming jurisdiction over an individual, whereas s. 68(1) of the  
 Act 
  contemplates situations where the IAD has already assumed jurisdiction over a person does not, in my view, justify ignoring the express language of the provision, and finding constitutional jurisdiction where it would not otherwise exist.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [45] 
  Finally, reference should be made to the decision in  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 139 F.T.R. 315 (T.D.).  
 Reynolds 
  was decided under s. 70(5) of the previous  
 Immigration Act 
 , which deprived a would-be appellant of a right of appeal in relation to a deportation order that had previously been stayed, where the individual in question had been found to be a danger to the public. The respondent relies on  
 Reynolds 
  in support of its contention that the IAD is without jurisdiction to entertain Mr. Ferri's constitutional challenge.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [46] 
  While  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  the Court came to a similar conclusion as to the IAD's lack of jurisdiction to decide a  
 Charter 
  question in analogous circumstances, I am reluctant to ascribe too much weight to the decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 , given that it was decided under the previous  
 Immigration Act 
  and does not deal with the provision of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
  under scrutiny in this case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [47] 
  Even more importantly,  
 Reynolds 
  was decided prior to the Supreme Court of Canada's reformulation of the test for determining whether an administrative tribunal has  
 Charter 
  competence. While  
 Martin 
  does not appear to explicitly overrule every aspect of the  
 Reynolds 
  decision, I am nevertheless satisfied that the case must be approached with some caution for these reasons. As a consequence, I prefer to rely upon the analysis articulated above.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [48] 
  Finally, I do not accept that Mr. Ferri will be left without a forum in which to pursue his constitutional challenge to s. 68(4) of  
 IRPA 
 . It is entirely open to him to commence an action in this Court, seeking a declaration that the legislative provision in issue is unconstitutional. It would then also be open to Mr. Ferri to adduce the evidence before this Court that he believes will support his challenge.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [49] 
  For these reasons, the application is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Certification  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [50] 
  The parties jointly propose the following question for certification:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Does the Immigration Appeal Division have the jurisdiction to determine a constitutional challenge to s. 68(4) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [51] 
  I agree that this is an appropriate question for certification, and accordingly, the question will be certified.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Blanchard, J. 
 : The Minister seeks judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27 [ 
 IRPA 
 ] of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated June 22, 2012, granting the Respondent refugee status.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The Applicant seeks an order pursuant to paragraph 18.3(1)( 
 b 
 ) of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
 , R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7 quashing or setting aside the decision and referring the matter back to the RPD for determination in accordance with such directions as the Court considers appropriate.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 I. 
   
 Facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The Respondent is a 32-year-old Sri Lankan citizen who is ethnic Tamil. He arrived in Canada aboard the  
 MV Sun Sea 
  with approximately 500 others on August 13, 2010, and immediately sought asylum pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the  
 IRPA 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  In his Personal Information Form (PIF), the Respondent described his personal circumstances as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) The Respondent was born in Navatkadu Varani, Jaffna, a town in the northernmost region of Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) The Respondent's family suffered as a result of the war and was required to relocate on many occasions. Many family members were lost, including his sister who was killed by a landmine.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) The Respondent was living with his uncle in Vanni in August 2006. At that time the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were forcibly recruiting young people. The Respondent's company paid a percentage of his salary to the LTTE so that he would not be forced to join.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) From 2007 to 2008 the Sri Lankan army was advancing toward Vanni. As circumstances worsened, the Respondent and his uncle's family relocated twice to avoid the bombing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (e) At the outset of 2009, the LTTE were forcibly recruiting every young Tamil in the area, and the Respondent went into hiding since he did not want to join.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (f) On May 16, 2009, the Sri Lankan Army forced Tamils into a controlled area. The Respondent was interned in a camp and questioned by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the government about whether he had had any training with the LTTE. He denied any affiliation, but the CID did not believe him. He was threatened but eventually permitted to transfer and join his uncle's family in another camp. The Respondent bribed the Sri Lankan Army and paramilitary forces to release him. Once released, fearing re-arrest, he hid with relatives until he was able to make his way to Colombo.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (g) The Respondent applied for and received a passport and an Indian visa. He went to Chennai for one month in the summer of 2009 and decided to return based on reports that everything was normal in Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (h) On the way back from the airport, the police stopped the Respondent at three different checkpoints because he did not have a police registration. The CID also took him to the police station because he did not have his identity card. Upon being released, the Respondent feared that he would be arrested on "suspicion" and killed because his registration would not check out. As a result, he fled to Singapore in August 2009. He registered with the UNHCR in Malaysia, and made his way to Thailand. He left for Canada aboard the  
 MV Sun Sea 
  on May 14, 2010.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II. Decision under review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The RPD found the Respondent to be a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the  
 IRPA 
  by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution based on his membership in a particular social group and imputed political opinion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  The RPD found the Respondent to be a young, single, male Tamil from the north of Sri Lanka, who has traveled on the  
 MV Sun Sea 
 , a smuggling operation, alleged to have been organized by the LTTE. As such the RPD found that he fits into the category of membership in a particular social group, in addition to political opinion, imputed or real, due to perceived interaction with LTTE operatives.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The RPD found that the Respondent demonstrated a lack of subjective fear of harm when he returned from India to Sri Lanka. The RPD determined that his registration with the UNHCR in Malaysia and Thailand, coupled with his "nefarious" seaborne trip to Canada prior to receiving the UNHCR's decision, demonstrates both a lack of subjective fear and asylum shopping. Further, the RPD found other credibility concerns with the Respondent's narrative, namely that he embellished aspects of his claim. The RPD did not believe that the Respondent was beaten, as claimed, that anyone tried to beat him, that he received numerous death threats from the Sri Lankan authorities or that he was tortured in the camp.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  The RPD found that the Sri Lankan authorities were not interested in the Respondent prior to his departure from Sri Lanka. The Respondent was easily able to pass through checkpoints without a police certificate and with an ID card indicating a suspicious location. He went to India, exiting Sri Lanka through the normal process, and returned one month later. He was photographed and his ID noted while interned in the camp, and the Sri Lankan authorities had many opportunities to arrest him. He was not arrested when exiting Sri Lanka the second time.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Notwithstanding its credibility findings and the Respondent's lack of a subjective fear of harm while in Sri Lanka, the RPD found that the Respondent had established a basis for a  
 sur place 
  claim by reason of his perceived ties to the LTTE. The RPD found on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent would be wanted for more specific questioning regarding his potential knowledge, real or imputed, of LTTE operatives because of the time he spent on the MV Sun Sea, and his exposure to a crew that allegedly had LTTE ties.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  The RPD was satisfied that sources were generally agreed that Tamils from the north and east were likely to receive greater scrutiny upon arrival at the Colombo airport. Connection with the LTTE, illegal departure from Sri Lanka, or involvement with the media or NGOs among other factors would put a returnee at greater risk of detention. Further, violations of humanitarian and international human rights law, including torture and coercion, by the Sri Lankan state security forces have been documented for a significant period. Although Sri Lanka has recognized that there is a crisis of impunity for human rights abuses by state forces and those associated with the state, no measures have been undertaken to address these issues. The RPD observed that the ICRC reporting indicates that there is a continuing prevalence of abduction, arbitrary arrest and detention without due process, and torture. The Sri Lankan government's unwillingness to allow the ICRC access to its LTTE rehabilitation camps and areas of (predominantly Tamil) returnees also demonstrates the government's hostility to accounting for the behaviour of its state security actors.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  The RPD concluded as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Based on the evidence before me, in particular his association with the MV Sun Sea that has been internationally touted as an LTTE smuggling operation and having an LTTE affiliated crew, and the claimant is a young, single, male Tamil from the north, I find these cumulative factors would make him a person of interest to the Sri Lankan authorities if returned to Sri Lanka. On a balance of probabilities, I find that he would be questioned and detained. In the face of the independent objective country evidence, I find that he faces more than a serious possibility of persecution by the state security apparatus. As the state is the perpetrator of such treatment, I also find that he has no state protection or viable internal flight alternative.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III. Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Did the RPD err in concluding that the Respondent's claim had a nexus to a ground in the Convention refugee definition, pursuant to section 96 of the  
 IRPA 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Did the RPD err in finding that the Respondent has a well-founded fear of persecution?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV. Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The issue of nexus to a convention ground raises a question of mixed law and fact. The question raised concerns the existence of a connection between Convention grounds and the Respondent's particular factual circumstances. It follows that the applicable standard of review is reasonableness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Issues relating to the sufficiency and intelligibility of reasons are reviewable on the reasonableness standard. See:  
 Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  
 Dunsmuir 
  at paragraph 47.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Issues relating to the sufficiency of the evidence to link a claimant to a particular social group and the "well foundedness" of the Respondent's fear raise questions of mixed law and fact and are also reviewable on the reasonableness standard.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V. Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The Applicant argues that the RPD erred in finding that as a young Tamil male from the north of Sri Lanka who has traveled on the  
 MV Sun Sea 
 , the Respondent was part of a "particular social group" for the purpose of the Convention refugee definition and therefore that there was a nexus or link between the alleged persecution feared by the Respondent and a Convention refugee ground.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  In  
 Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ 
 B380 
 ], a recent decision of this Court, Chief Justice Crampton held that the RPD erred in finding that passengers on the  
 MV Sun Sea 
  are members of a particular social group for the purpose of the Convention refugee definition. At paragraph 23 of his reasons, the Chief Justice wrote that  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 ... it is implicit in the approach that was adopted in [ 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 63-70]  
 Ward 
 , above, that the historical fact of having come voluntarily together in a particular way for the ultimate purpose of traveling to Canada to seek refugee status is not sufficient basis upon which to become a "particular social group" within the meaning of section 96.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Supreme Court in  
 Ward 
  teaches that the finding of a particular social group must take into account the "underlying themes of the defence of human rights and anti-discrimination that form the basis for the international refugee protection initiative." Voluntarily choosing to set sail for Canada on an illegal human smuggling ship does not engage the defence of human rights or anti-discrimination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  I agree with Chief Justice Crampton's conclusion that passengers on the  
 MV Sun Sea 
  do not represent a particular social group for the purpose of section 96. In the result, I find that the RPD's conclusion to the contrary was unreasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  Unlike  
 B380 
 , in the instant case the RPD did not base its conclusion solely on the Respondent's membership in a particular social group as a passenger on the  
 MV Sun Sea 
 . It also expressly found that the Respondent would face persecution on the basis of perceived political opinion and, implicitly, on the basis of his ethnicity/race.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  The following passages in the RPD's reasons support the above proposition:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] I find the claimant is a young, single, male Tamil from the north of Sri Lanka, who has traveled on the  
 MV Sun Sea 
 , which was a smuggling operation, alleged to have been organized by the LTTE. Due to these factors, I find the claimant fits into the category of membership in a particular social group in addition to political opinion, imputed or real due to perceived interaction with LTTE operatives.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] ... I find on a balance of probabilities that because of the time he spent on the  
 MV Sun Sea 
 , and his exposure to a crew that allegedly had LTTE ties, he would be wanted for more specific questioning regarding his potential knowledge, real or imputed, of LTTE operatives.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [51] Based on the evidence before me, in particular his association with  
 MV Sun Sea 
  that has been internationally touted as an LTTE smuggling operation and having an LTTE affiliated crew, and that the claimant is a young, single, make Tamil from the north. I find these cumulative factors would make him a person of interest to the Sri Lankan authorities if returned to Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  The Supreme Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  at paragraph 48 endorsed the view that, when reviewing a decision on the reasonableness standard, a court must pay "respectful attention to the reasons offered  
 or which could have been offered 
  in support of a decision" Mr. Justice Evans in a dissenting decision in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (subsequently adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada, in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) reinforced this view. He wrote at paragraph 164 of his reasons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The underlined words avoid an unduly formalistic approach to judicial review. Thus, to the extent that the Tribunal does not fully explain aspects of its decision, the Court may consult evidence referred to by the Tribunal in order to flesh out its reasons. However, I do not regard the Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  as inviting a reviewing court to usurp the tribunal's responsibility for justifying its decisions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  The RPD's findings are not as clear as they could have been and in some cases arguably deficient. For instance, the RPD could not rely upon imputed  
 knowledge 
  of LTTE activities to support its finding of imputed political opinion. I am nevertheless satisfied that the evidence referred to by the Tribunal in its reasons supports a finding that the Respondent, as a young, Tamil male from northern Sri Lanka, has a well-founded fear of persecution by reasons of his race and his imputed political opinion by reason of his perceived  
 association 
  with the LTTE. I am satisfied that the RPD's conclusion is reasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  In the circumstances, I find the following passage in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) (QL) instructive on the issue of nexus to race. In his reasons, Justice Hugessen, writing on behalf of the Federal Court of Appeal, has this to say:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 In our view, it is obvious beyond any need of demonstration that if a person faces "real and oppressive" risks, including a risk of "substantial violence", from state sponsored sources (the IPKF) because he or she belongs to a group one of whose defining characteristics is race, (young Tamil males), it is simply impossible to say that such person does not have an objective fear of persecution for reasons of race.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 See also  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  In its reasons, the RPD repeatedly referenced country documentation concerning the treatment of Tamils from northern Sri Lanka by government agencies and the risks faced by such returnees. It is therefore implicit in the reasons that the RPD considered the Respondent's objective fear of persecution to have a nexus with his Tamil ethnicity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  The Applicant argues that the RPD failed to properly consider all of the evidence when he found that the Respondent had a well-founded fear of persecution on the "sole basis" that he had contact with the LTTE on the  
 MV Sun Sea 
  and therefore acquired an "association" with the LTTE.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  In my opinion, the RPD's treatment of the evidence was reasonable. The RPD considered all of the evidence before it including the evidence relating to the Respondent's circumstances, the treatment of returnees, particularly Tamils from the north, and the attitude of Sri Lankan authorities relating to passengers who traveled on the  
 MV Sun Sea 
 . The RPD was entitled to prefer the evidence it relied upon to the documentary evidence submitted by the Applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VI. Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  The RPD's conclusion that the Respondent's alleged membership in a "particular social group" is unreasonable. However, its conclusion that the Respondent would face persecution based on imputed political opinion and, by implication, ethnicity is reasonable. The Board made no reviewable error in its consideration of the evidence. On the whole, the decision falls within the range of defensible outcomes based on the facts and the law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  The parties have had the opportunity to raise a serious question of general importance as contemplated by paragraph 74( 
 d 
 ) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27, and have not done so. I am satisfied that no serious question of general importance arises on this record. I do not propose to certify a question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VII. Confidentiality  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  The parties shall file written submissions setting out their respective positions on the content of the Reasons to be released publicly no later than ten (10) days from receipt of these Reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 I. 
   
 Les faits  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Le défendeur est un citoyen du Sri Lanka d'origine tamoule âgé de 32 ans. Il est arrivé au Canada à bord du MS  
 Sun Sea 
  en compagnie d'environ 500 autres passagers le 13 août 2010, et il a immédiatement présenté une demande d'asile en vertu de l'article 96 et du paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  Dans son formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP), le défendeur décrit sa situation personnelle comme suit:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 a) Le défendeur est né à Navatkadu Varani, Jaffna, une ville du Nord du Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 b) La famille du défendeur a souffert de la guerre et a dû déménager à de nombreuses reprises. Le défendeur a perdu plusieurs membres de sa famille, dont sa sœur qui a été tuée par une mine terrestre.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 c) Le défendeur vivait avec son oncle à Vanni en août 2006. À l'époque, les Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (TLET) recrutaient des jeunes par la force. L'entreprise pour laquelle le défendeur travaillait versait un pourcentage de son salaire aux TLET pour que le défendeur ne soit pas forcé de se joindre à l'organisation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 d) De 2007 à 2008, l'armée sri lankaise se rapprochait de Vanni. La situation s'aggravant, le défendeur et la famille de son oncle ont dû déménager deux fois pour éviter des attentats à la bombe.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 e) Au début de 2009, les TLET forçaient tous les jeunes Tamouls de la région à se joindre à eux; le défendeur a dû se cacher, car il ne voulait pas se joindre à l'organisation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 f) Le 16 mai 2009, l'armée sri lankaise a ordonné que tous les Tamouls se rendent dans une région contrôlée. Le défendeur a été interné dans un camp, et des agents du département des enquêtes criminelles (DEC) du gouvernement l'ont interrogé pour savoir s'il avait reçu une formation avec les TLET. Il a nié leur être affilié, mais les agents du DEC ne l'ont pas cru. Il a été menacé, puis il a par la suite obtenu la permission d'être transféré dans un autre camp où se trouvait la famille de son oncle. Le défendeur a versé un pot-de-vin à l'armée sri lankaise et aux forces paramilitaires pour qu'elles le relâchent. Une fois relâché, craignant d'être arrêté de nouveau, il s'est caché chez des parents, avant de trouver le moyen de se rendre à Colombo.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 g) Le défendeur a présenté une demande de passeport et une demande de visa pour l'Inde, et il a obtenu les deux. Il s'est rendu à Chennai, où il est resté un mois à l'été 2009, puis il a décidé de retourner au Sri Lanka, sur la base de rapports, croyant qu'il y avait un retour à la normale dans le pays.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 h) Alors qu'il rentrait de l'aéroport, des policiers ont arrêté le défendeur à trois différents points de contrôle, car il n'avait pas d'enregistrement de la police. Des agents du DEC l'ont également emmené au commissariat de police parce qu'il n'avait pas sa carte d'identité. Une fois relâché, le défendeur a craint d'être arrêté en tant que suspect et d'être tué en raison de l'absence d'enregistrement. Par conséquent, il a fui à Singapour en août 2009. Il s'est enregistré auprès du Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (UNHCR) en Malaisie, puis s'est rendu en Thaïlande. Le 14 mai 2010, il s'est embarqué pour le Canada à bord du MS  
 Sun Sea 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II. Décision contrôlée  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  La SPR a conclu que le défendeur avait qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention aux termes de l'article 96 de la LIPR, car il craignait avec raison d'être persécuté du fait de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques présumées.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  La SPR a conclu que le défendeur était un jeune Tamoul célibataire du Nord du Sri Lanka qui avait voyagé à bord du MS  
 Sun Sea 
 , dans le cadre d'une opération de passage de clandestins que les TLET auraient organisée. En raison de ces facteurs, la SPR a estimé que le demandeur était visé du fait de son appartenance à un groupe social et de ses opinions politiques, présumées ou réelles, en raison d'une perception d'interaction avec des agents des TLET.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  La SPR a estimé que le défendeur avait démontré une absence de crainte subjective de préjudice en quittant l'Inde pour retourner au Sri Lanka. La SPR a conclu que, outre son voyage « répréhensible » en mer pour se rendre au Canada avant que l'UNHCR ait rendu sa décision, le fait qu'il s'est enregistré auprès du UNHCR en Malaisie et en Thaïlande démontre à la fois une absence d'une crainte subjective et une recherche du meilleur pays d'asile. La SPR a également conclu que l'exposé circonstancié du défendeur soulevait des doutes quant à la crédibilité, en ce sens où celui-ci avait embelli des aspects de sa demande d'asile. La SPR ne croyait pas que le défendeur ait été battu, comme il l'alléguait, ni qu'une personne ait essayé de le battre, ou encore qu'il ait reçu de nombreuses menaces de mort des autorités sri lankaises ou qu'il ait été torturé dans le camp.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  La SPR a conclu que les autorités sri lankaises ne s'étaient pas intéressées au défendeur avant son départ du Sri Lanka. Il a été en mesure de passer les points de contrôle sans certificat de police et avec une carte d'identité précisant qu'il provenait d'une région suspecte. Il s'est rendu en Inde et a quitté le Sri Lanka en suivant la procédure normale, puis est revenu au Sri Lanka un mois plus tard. Il a été pris en photo et sa carte d'identité a été prise en note lorsqu'il était dans le camp, et les autorités sri lankaises ont eu de nombreuses occasions de l'arrêter. Il n'a pas été arrêté lorsqu'il a quitté le Sri Lanka la seconde fois.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  En dépit des conclusions relatives à la crédibilité et de l'absence de crainte subjective de préjudice du défendeur lorsqu'il se trouvait au Sri Lanka, la SPR a conclu que le défendeur avait établi un motif justifiant une demande d'asile sur place du fait de ses liens présumés aux yeux de certains avec les TLET. La SPR a conclu, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le défendeur serait recherché aux fins de questionnement approfondi concernant ses connaissances potentielles, réelles ou imputées, d'agents des TLET en raison du temps qu'il avait passé à bord du MS  
 Sun Sea 
  et de son exposition à un équipage qui aurait eu des liens avec les TLET.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  La SPR était convaincue que les sources convenaient, de façon générale, que les Tamouls du Nord et de l'Est du pays étaient susceptibles de faire l'objet d'un examen plus approfondi que les autres personnes à leur arrivée à l'aéroport de Colombo. Des liens avec les TLET, un départ illégal du Sri Lanka ou une présence dans les médias ou le fait d'avoir eu affaire avec des ONG seraient quelques-uns des facteurs qui augmenteraient le risque de détention des personnes retournant au pays. Les violations des droits de la personne et du droit humanitaire international, notamment la torture et la coercition, par les forces de sécurité sri lankaises, ont été documentées pendant une longue période. Bien que le Sri Lanka ait reconnu qu'il y a une crise d'impunité en ce qui a trait aux violations des droits de la personne par les forces de l'État et des personnes qui travaillent en collaboration avec celui-ci, aucune mesure n'a été prise afin de remédier à ces problèmes. La SPR a constaté qu'un rapport du Comité international de la Croix-Rouge (CICR) fait état du problème des enlèvements, des arrestations arbitraires et des détentions sans application régulière de la loi, de même que de la torture. Le fait que le gouvernement sri lankais restreigne l'accès du CICR aux camps de réadaptation des TLET et aux régions où se concentrent les personnes retournées au pays (majoritairement tamoules) illustre à quel point le gouvernement est réticent à rendre compte du comportement des responsables de la sécurité de l'État.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  La SPR a conclu ce qui suit:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Compte tenu des éléments de preuve dont je dispose, en particulier de l'association du demandeur d'asile avec le MS  
 Sun Sea 
  qui a été reconnu à l'échelle internationale comme ayant servi à une opération de passage de clandestins membres des TLET et dont les membres de l'équipage étaient affiliés aux TLET, et compte tenu du fait que le demandeur d'asile est un jeune Tamoul du Nord, j'estime que ces facteurs cumulatifs feraient de lui une personne d'intérêt pour les autorités sri-lankaises s'il retournait au Sri Lanka. Selon la prépondérance des probabilités, je conclus qu'il serait questionné et détenu. À la lumière des éléments de preuve objectifs et indépendants sur le pays, je conclus qu'il existe davantage qu'une possibilité sérieuse que le demandeur d'asile soit persécuté par les autorités responsables de la sécurité de l'État. Étant donné que l'État est l'auteur de tels traitements, je conclus également que le demandeur d'asile ne dispose d'aucune protection de l'État ni possibilité de refuge intérieur viable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III. Les questions en litige 
 
 1. La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant à l'existence d'un lien entre la situation du défendeur et l'un des motifs reconnus par la Convention, conformément à l'article 96 de la LIPR?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que le défendeur craignait avec raison d'être persécuté?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 La norme de contrôle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  La question du lien avec l'un des motifs de la Convention soulève une question mixte de fait et de droit. Cette question concerne l'existence d'un rapport entre des motifs prévus par la Convention et le contexte factuel propre au défendeur. Il s'ensuit que la norme de contrôle applicable est celle de la décision raisonnable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Les questions relatives à la suffisance et à l'intelligibilité des motifs sont contrôlables selon la norme de la décision raisonnable. Voir  
 Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  
 Dunsmuir 
 , au paragraphe 47.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Les questions relatives au caractère suffisant de la preuve pour associer un demandeur à un groupe social particulier et au « bien-fondé » de la crainte du défendeur soulèvent des questions mixtes de fait et de droit, et elles sont également contrôlables selon la norme de la décision raisonnable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V. Analyse  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Le demandeur soutient que la SPR a commis une erreur en concluant que, en tant que jeune Tamoul originaire du Nord du Sri Lanka ayant voyagé à bord du MS  
 Sun Sea 
 , le défendeur faisait partie d'un « groupe social » visé par la définition de réfugié au sens de la Convention, et donc qu'il y avait un lien entre la crainte de persécution alléguée du défendeur et l'un des motifs prévus par la Convention sur les réfugiés.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Dans  
 Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ 
 B380 
 ], une décision récemment rendue par la Cour, le juge en chef Crampton a affirmé que la SPR avait commis une erreur en concluant que les passagers ayant voyagé à bord du MS  
 Sun Sea 
  constituaient un groupe social visé par la définition de réfugié au sens de la Convention. Au paragraphe 23 de ses motifs, le juge en chef a énoncé ce qui suit:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 il ressort implicitement de l'approche adoptée dans l'arrêt [ 
 Canada (Procureur général) c Ward 
 , [1993] 2 RCS 689, aux paragraphes 63 à 70], précité, que le fait historique d'être venu, volontairement, ensemble, d'une façon spécifique, dans le but ultime de voyager au Canada afin de demander l'asile n'est pas une base suffisante sur laquelle on peut devenir un « groupe social » au sens de l'article 96.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 La Cour suprême, dans  
 Ward 
 , explique que, pour conclure à l'appartenance à un groupe social, il faut tenir compte des « thèmes sous-jacents généraux de la défense des droits de la personne et de la lutte contre la discrimination qui viennent justifier l'initiative internationale de protection des réfugiés ». Le fait de s'embarquer volontairement pour le Canada sur un navire de passage clandestin ne s'inscrit aucunement dans le cadre de la défense des droits de la personne et de la lutte contre la discrimination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Je conviens avec le juge en chef Crampton que les passagers du MS  
 Sun Sea 
  ne constituent pas un groupe social au sens de l'article 96. Par conséquent, j'estime que la conclusion contraire qu'a tirée la SPR n'était pas raisonnable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  À la différence de  
 B380 
 , dans le cas qui nous occupe, la SPR n'a pas fondé sa conclusion uniquement sur l'appartenance du défendeur à un groupe social, soit celui des passagers du MS  
 Sun Sea 
 . Elle a aussi expressément conclu que le défendeur ferait l'objet de persécution du fait de ses opinions politiques perçues et, implicitement, de sa race ou de son origine ethnique.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  Les extraits suivants des motifs de la SPR appuient la proposition qui précède:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] Je conclus que le demandeur d'asile est un jeune Tamoul célibataire du Nord du Sri Lanka qui a voyagé à bord du MS  
 Sun Sea 
 , dans le cadre d'une opération de passage de clandestins que les TLET auraient organisée. En raison de ces facteurs, j'estime que le demandeur d'asile est visé du fait de son appartenance à un groupe social et de ses opinions politiques, présumées ou réelles, en raison de son interaction apparente avec des agents des TLET.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] [...] je conclus, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que, en raison du temps qu'il a passé à bord du MS  
 Sun Sea 
  et de son exposition à un équipage qui aurait eu des liens avec les TLET, le demandeur d'asile serait recherché aux fins de questionnement approfondi concernant ses connaissances potentielles, réelles ou imputées, d'agents des TLET.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [51] Compte tenu des éléments de preuve dont je dispose, en particulier de l'association du demandeur d'asile avec le MS  
 Sun Sea 
  qui a été reconnu à l'échelle internationale comme ayant servi à une opération de passage de clandestins membres des TLET et dont les membres de l'équipage étaient affiliés aux TLET, et compte tenu du fait que le demandeur d'asile est un jeune Tamoul du Nord, j'estime que ces facteurs cumulatifs feraient de lui une personne d'intérêt pour les autorités sri lankaises s'il retournait au Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Au paragraphe 48 de  
 Dunsmuir 
 , la Cour suprême a souscrit au point de vue selon lequel, au moment de contrôler une décision selon la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable, une cour doit porter « une attention respectueuse aux motifs donnés  
 ou qui pourraient être donnés 
  à l'appui d'une décision ». Le juge Evans a confirmé ce point de vue dans ses motifs dissidents dans  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (subséquemment adoptés par la Cour suprême du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Voici ce qu'il écrit, au paragraphe 164 de ses motifs:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Les mots soulignés indiquent qu'on ne doit pas aborder le contrôle judiciaire sous un angle trop formaliste. Ainsi, dans la mesure où le Tribunal n'explique pas pleinement certains aspects de sa décision, la Cour peut se reporter aux éléments de preuve cités par le Tribunal pour étoffer ses motifs. Je ne considère cependant pas l'arrêt  
 Dunsmuir 
  comme une invitation faite à la cour de révision d'usurper le rôle qui incombe au tribunal de justifier ses décisions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  Les conclusions de la SPR auraient pu être beaucoup plus claires qu'elles ne le sont; il est permis de penser qu'elles sont lacunaires à certains égards. Par exemple, la SPR ne pouvait invoquer la présumée  
 connaissance 
  des activités des TLET pour appuyer sa conclusion relative aux opinions politiques présumées. Je suis néanmoins convaincu que la preuve à laquelle le tribunal a fait référence dans ses motifs permet de conclure que le défendeur, en tant que jeune Tamoul célibataire venant du Nord du Sri Lanka, craint avec raison d'être persécuté du fait de sa race et de ses opinions politiques présumées en raison de son  
 association 
  perçue avec les TLET. Je suis convaincu que la conclusion de la SPR est raisonnable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  En l'occurrence, j'estime que l'extrait suivant de l'arrêt  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) (QL), est éclairant sur la question du lien avec la race. Dans ses motifs, le juge Hugessen, au nom de la Cour d'appel fédérale, a dit ce qui suit:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Selon nous, il est des plus évidents que lorsqu'une personne fait face à des risques « réels et accablants », y compris un risque d' « actes fort violents », de la part de groupes parrainés par l'État (l'IPKF), parce que cette personne fait partie d'un groupe dont la race est la caractéristique déterminante (les jeunes Tamuls de sexe masculin), il est tout simplement impossible de dire qu'une telle personne n'éprouve pas une crainte objective d'être persécutée du fait de sa race.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Voir aussi  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Dans ses motifs, la SPR a de nombreuses fois fait référence à la documentation sur le pays faisant état de la façon dont les agences gouvernementales traitent les Tamouls du Nord du Sri Lanka et des risques qui guettent ceux-ci lorsqu'ils reviennent au pays. Les motifs de la SPR laissent donc implicitement entendre que la crainte objective de persécution du défendeur a un lien avec son origine tamoule.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  Le demandeur soutient que la SPR n'avait pas correctement apprécié l'ensemble de la preuve lorsqu'elle a conclu que le défendeur avait une crainte fondée de persécution pour la seule raison qu'il avait eu des liens avec les TLET à bord du MS  
 Sun Sea 
  et qu'il avait donc été présumé qu'il était « associé » aux TLET.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Je suis d'avis que la SPR a traité la preuve de façon raisonnable. La SPR a tenu compte de tous les éléments de preuve dont elle disposait, y compris ceux ayant trait à la situation du défendeur, au traitement réservé aux rapatriés, notamment les Tamouls du Nord, et à l'attitude des autorités sri lankaises à l'égard des passagers ayant voyagé à bord du MS  
 Sun Sea 
 . La SPR était en droit de préférer les éléments de preuve sur laquelle elle s'est fondée à la preuve documentaire soumise par le demandeur.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VI. Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  La conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle le défendeur aurait fait partie d'un « groupe social » n'est pas raisonnable. Toutefois, sa conclusion selon laquelle le défendeur pourrait être persécuté en raison de ses opinions politiques présumées et, implicitement, de son origine ethnique est raisonnable. La Commission n'a commis aucune erreur susceptible de contrôle en examinant la preuve. Dans l'ensemble, la décision appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Les parties ont eu la possibilité de soulever une question grave de portée générale au sens de l'alinéa 74 
 d 
 ) de la  
 Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés 
 , L.C. 2001, ch. 27, et elles ne l'ont pas fait. Je suis convaincu que la présente affaire ne soulève aucune question de ce genre. En conséquence, je n'ai pas l'intention de certifier une question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VII. Confidentialité  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  Les parties déposeront des observations écrites exposant leur position respective à l'égard du contenu des présents motifs, les motifs devant être rendus publics au plus tard dix (10) jours après la réception des présents motifs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  La Cour a demandé aux avocats des parties de lui faire part de leurs observations sur le contenu des motifs publics du jugement et jugement.

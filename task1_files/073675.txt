 Summary: 
 
 A Polish husband and wife and two children were denied Convention refugee status. Leave to apply for landing from within Canada on compassionate and humanitarian grounds was denied. The family applied for a further review of compassionate and humanitarian considerations. That review was dismissed. An immigration officer advised the family of their scheduled date of removal to Poland. The officer agreed to review the compassionate and humanitarian grounds again, and invited written representations. Those representations were considered and the decision that there were insufficient compassionate and humanitarian grounds was confirmed. The family applied for judicial review, claiming breach of the duty of fairness and violation of ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, dismissed the application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Gibson, J. 
 : This is an application for judicial review of a decision of an Immigration Officer or Officers wherein it was determined that, in the terms of the Originating Notice of Motion, "... there were no humanitarian or compassionate grounds to permit the Applicants to remain in Canada ...". More specifically, the decision in question was made pursuant to s. 114(2) of the  
 Immigration Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, and had the effect of precluding the Applicants from any opportunity to apply for landed immigrant status from within Canada. The decision in question was communicated to the Applicants' counsel on the 16th day of April, 1992. Leave to commence this application was granted by Nöel, J., on the 10th day of November, 1992.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The relief requested is stated in the following terms in the Applicants' Originating Notice of Motion:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(a) a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of Immigration Officers, wherein it was determined that there were no humanitarian or compassionate grounds to permit the Applicants to remain in Canada, such decision being communicated to the Applicants' counsel on April 16, 1992;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(b) a writ of mandamus directing the Minister's Officials to consider the Applicants' request to remain in Canada in accordance with the duty of fairness and pursuant to the principal of consistent treatment under the Policy Guidelines. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [3] 
  A preliminary issue was raised before me. Counsel for the Respondent objected to the admissibility of exhibit "B" to the Affidavit of Dr. Bronte Golda sworn the 27th day of April 1992, that exhibit being a copy of a report dated the 22nd day of April, 1992 by Dr. Michael T. Newhouse, and to all portions of the affidavit of Dr. Golda and of the affidavits of John C. Munro sworn the 20th day of April, 1992 and the 29th day of April, 1992 that in any way make reference to or rely on the report or the forthcoming report of Dr. Newhouse.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  It is trite law that judicial review of a decision of a federal board, commission or other tribunal should proceed on the basis of the evidence that was before the decision-maker. It is obvious that Dr. Newhouse's report post-dated the decision in question and thus constituted evidence not before the decision-maker. I sustained the objection. The judicial review thus proceeded on the basis only of evidence that was before the decision-maker.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  The factual background leading up to the decision in question is as follows. The Applicants are a married couple and their two children. They arrived in Canada at Gander, Newfoundland during the summer and autumn of 1989 on two separate flights that directly or indirectly originated in Poland, their native land. They claimed Convention refugee status. The Applicants moved to the Hamilton, Ontario area. On the 27th day of August, 1990 their Convention refugee claims were rejected by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board and leave to appeal that decision was later denied. In February, 1991, leave on humanitarian and compassionate grounds to apply for landing from within Canada was rejected at St. John's Newfoundland.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  Through a solicitor, they applied for a further review on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. In a letter dated the 1st day of April, 1991 to the Canadian Immigration Centre in London, Ontario, the Applicant's solicitor provided the following information and material:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "After our conversation my understanding of their situation is that their file has been referred to your office as the review of their home country has been completed by the Ottawa Office and has been found not to be a dangerous country to return to.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The final stage is a review of their situation by your office prior to removal to determine if there are any solid humanitarian and compassionate grounds on which they may remain in Canada. This applies to both Mr. and Mrs. Lemiecha and their children.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Accordingly, I have commenced the process to obtain information on their role in the Canadian community and how well they are adapting to Canada and how important their continued presence in the country would be to that community.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Please therefore find enclosed the following material which should assist you.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Letter from Mr. and Mrs. Lemiecha expressing their desire to remain in Canada addressed to the Minister.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Original translations of educational certificates for both Mr. and Mrs. Lemiecha showing their education background in Poland.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. Letter of support from Mr. and Mrs. Krzyanowski, senior citizens, for the Lemiecha's.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. Letter of support from Walter Soroka and Apolnia Gienia, both disabled Canadians for the Lemiecha's.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 5. Letter of support and an employment offer to Teresa Lemiecha by owner of the Staropolskie Delikatesy.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 6. Letter of support for the family by the Pastor of St. Stanislaus Church.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 7. Letter of evaluation of the children by Principal of St. Ann School with November Report for both children.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "There are two areas which need further information and that is a medical update for the son Rafal and further information of the support to the disabled people Walter Soroka, and Apolonia Sienia which I plan to do by affidavit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "I hope to have this material before the end of this month and if you require any update of the information provided so far please do not hesitate to contact my office. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [7] 
  For whatever reason, "the medical update for the son Rafal" was not completed within the time frame contemplated in the last quoted paragraph. Indeed, it was only completed the 2nd day of September, 1991 and was apparently received by the Applicant's solicitor in mid-September. No prejudice would have flowed from the long delay if it had then been promptly forwarded to the Immigration Centre. Unfortunately it was not.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The substance of the report, prepared by Dr. Bronte Golda and entitled "Medical Legal Report" reads as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "I am writing this medical report at your request in regards to this nine-year old boy. You are wishing for me to provide you with some explanation of the report that you received from Dr. Peer who is a Pediatrician, who, at my request, saw this boy. On interviewing the mother and going through various reports from Poland, I am in the position to give you a background history on this boy. Between 1987 and 1988 this boy was admitted to a hospital twice, when he was treated with steroids intravenously, inhalation and the treatment lasted about a week. Also, the Polish system is slightly different than the Canadian system, when the patient gets sick at home and the family calls the ambulance, the doctor always attend the ambulance driver and provides the immediate necessary treatment at home. This means that each visit to the patient's house may not end up with taking that particular patient to the hospital. According to the mother, this boy was treated by an ambulance physician almost once per week with an attack of asthma, and the treatment was consistent with inhalation and intravenous hydrocortisone at home. Since they arrived in Hamilton, this boy only uses a Ventolin puffer maybe once a year when he gets a cold. He does not require any IV steroids which, of course, will have severe adverse side effects since he is so young, and also will create the asthma to be dependent on steroids which would end up causing him to have tremendous side effects in the long-run. In regards to the area where they live, they are coming from the east part of Poland, which was severely exposed to Chernobyl radiation and this could have had some effect on this child.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In summary then, I think it not very human to tell this boy, after he spent some years in Canada, to go back to Poland. Where I would say there is quite a high chance of a return of his asthmatic attacks, due to severe pollution, where the care is not readily available with the newest methods of treating asthma. Also, this boy had done very well at school. His English is great. Since everything is coming along very good for these people, I would not see any reason why Canada has to send them back. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [9] 
  The report of Dr. Peer, a pediatrician, that is referred to in the foregoing report and was addressed to Dr. Golda, is dated the 12th day of June, 1991 and in substance reads as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "I saw Rafal on the 10th of June, 1991. He is nine and has a history of asthma. I understand that you reviewed the reports from Poland and between 1987 and 1989 he was admitted a few times to hospital and was in severe asthmatic attack. He required IV steroids at that time. I do not know whether there are environmental factors responsible for it or other reasons but it seems that since he came to Canada about 1½ years ago he has been stable without any attacks. Initially he was in Newfoundland and was treated with Ventolin but didn't really require much of it. Since then he has improved gradually and he apparently did not require any medications at the present time.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "He has no asthma on exertion and apparently does not have any known allergies to cause any problems since he came to Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The past medical history revealed that he was born in Poland, birthweight was 2.5 kg, he was small for gestational age. Currently he is in Grade 3 in Canada and is doing well at school.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The family history revealed that the sister aged 11½ is healthy, the parents are healthy, no history of any asthma or allergies in the family.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "On examination, Rafal is a nine year old boy, weight is 28 kg, the height is 131 cm., both around the 50th percentile line, indicating very good growth. The blood pressure is 100/70 and the heart rate is about 80 per minute. The head was normal, eyes are normal, he has no ENT infections. The lungs are clear to auscultation, the air entry was excellent, there were no rales, rhonchi or bronchospasms. He has no murmurs, the abdomen is normal, the neurological examination is unremarkable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Rafal seems to do well at this point. He does not appear to require any medications for his asthma and it is possible that his asthma was precipitated by certain allergens which are not present around this area. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [10] 
  On the 15th day of October, 1991, without either of the foregoing reports having been brought to his attention, through no failing on the part of the Respondent or his or her officials I should point out, the second humanitarian and compassionate review resulted in a decision against the Applicants in the following terms:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "This letter refers to the request you have made on behalf of the above mentioned individuals for a review of their personal circumstances in consideration of the decision for their removal from Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "First, I would like to apologize for the undue delay in responding to your submission. I can only say that several reasons such as policy procedure changes, and a backlog or work in our office, have contributed to a great degree.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Further, your submission for review is comprehensive and encompassing and I have taken some time to consider all the points you have outlined in your package.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "As you know, when a review for Humanitarian and Compassionate grounds is requested, the reviewing officer is guided by Chapter 9 of the Immigration manual.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "I must consider and determine if there are any unusual, undeserved, or disproportionate hardships that would be caused to the person(s) seeking consideration if he, she, they, had to leave Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "With regards to the case before me, I must advise you that I have carefully considered all aspects of this family's circumstances and have determined that there are insufficient reasons to warrant processing of an application for landing from within Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "I realize that this decision will come as a disappointment to you and your clients, however I do feel that the Lemiecha family should have much better than average success in meeting the requirements through the normal processing of an immigrant application abroad, should they decide to do so. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [11] 
  The delay apologized for in no way worked to the prejudice of the Applicants. In fact, if it had been effectively utilized by them and on their behalf, the result might have been different and in their favour, but that is mere speculation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  No steps were taken to seek judicial review or further administrative review of the 15th day of October, 1991 decision, until the following events occurred.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  On the 24th day of March, 1992, the Applicants were served with a "Call In Notice" to schedule travel arrangements for their return to Poland. During a meeting on the 7th day of April with Immigration Officer Bauly, the Applicants were advised that their removal was scheduled for the 22nd day of April, 1992. Officer Bauly refused to entertain at that meeting oral representations on behalf of the Applicant's with regard to humanitarian and compassionate considerations but did agree to consider written representations, thus opening for a third time the issue of consideration of an application for landing from within Canada. Apparently the date of April 22nd remained firm.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Officer Bauly heard nothing by the 16th day of April. On that date she telephoned one of the solicitors for the Applicants. In a telephone conversation, she reconfirmed her willingness to receive written submissions, but indicated later the same day that a conference call would not be necessary for the purposes of the review. A copy of Dr. Golda's report (and apparently not a copy of Dr. Peer's report) was transmitted the same day by fax to Officer Bauly. The report was passed on to the attending Canada Immigration physician for his review. His advice was to the effect that Dr. Golda's report failed to establish sufficient medical reasons to allow the Applicants to apply for landed status from within Canada. No meeting took place and no teleconference was held involving the Canada Immigration official and physician and Dr. Golda and the Applicants solicitors.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Officer Bauly telephoned the Applicants solicitors and informed them of the conclusion of the Canada Immigration physician. She also advised them that she had concluded, based on the physician's conclusion and her own review of Dr. Golda's report and the material supplied that formed the basis of the decision of the 15th of October, 1991, that insufficient grounds existed to warrant an exemption for the Applicants on humanitarian and compassionate grounds from the visa requirements of the  
 Immigration Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  It is this decision of Officer Bauly, provided orally, that is the subject of this judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Three issues were ably argued before me at some length on behalf of the Applicants. Paraphrased from the Applicants' Application Record, they are the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "1. Did Officer Bauly, having undertaken a further humanitarian and compassionate grounds review, fail to comply with the duty to act fairly towards the Applicants in the conduct of that review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "2. Did Officer Bauly exceed her jurisdiction in exercising her statutory power of decision making unreasonably on the evidence before her.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "3. Did Officer Bauly's decision violate the Applicant's rights under sections 7 and 12 of the  
 Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
  to be free from cruel and unusual treatment and to security of the person. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [18] 
  I will deal with the issues presented in the order in which they are listed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. The Duty To Act Fairly  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  Counsel for the Applicants conceded before me that, given the factual background in this matter, Officer Bauly's decision, if she had simply and categorically refused any further review of compassionate and humanitarian considerations, would most likely have been unassailable. But, she argued, having undertaken a further review, having demonstrated compassion if you will, she then had to respect the duty to act fairly, at least to the minimum standard of that duty which, it was argued, required Officer Bauly to advise the Applicants of the case against them and provide them an opportunity to reply to that case. This minimum standard of fairness could have been met, it was argued, if Officer Bauly or her superiors had acceded to the request of the Applicant's solicitors for a telephone conference call that would have involved, presumably, Officer Bauly, the decision maker, and her medical advisor and the Applicants' solicitors and their medical advisor, Dr. Golda. The Applicants' solicitors and Dr. Golda held themselves ready for such a call throughout the critical day of the 16th of April, 1993.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  I conclude that the Applicants' case must fail on this ground.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  stated as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Next, the doctor's report is honest and probably frightening. The officers did not seem too impressed but they did not ignore it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "As emphasized earlier it is my responsibility to review the decision of the officers and this is not to be seen as an appeal from that decision. All of the data were before the officers and I could find nothing they ignored. There were positive aspects of the applicant's case such as her work record with L'Hotel and her knowledge of the English language. Similarly, there was for consideration by the officers the doctor's report and the impact of a negative decision, namely return to the Philippines to poverty or near poverty conditions. In the final analysis all this was before the officers and considered. The applicant may not and obviously does not agree with the officers' treatment of the medical report but it was considered. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [21] 
  As in the  
 Nueda 
  case, all of the information that the Applicants chose to put forward was before Officer Bauly. The Applicants were aware of young Rafal's medical condition and its relevance to a humanitarian and compassionate review as is evidenced by their solicitor's letter dated the 1st day of April, 1991. At the urging of Officer Bauly, they submitted a copy of Dr. Golda's report by fax on the 16th day of April, 1992. It was considered. It was not ignored. As in the  
 Nueda 
  case, the Applicants may not and obviously do not agree with Officer Bauly's treatment of the medical report, but it was considered and the advice provided to Officer Bauly by the physician that was available to her was conveyed to the Applicants solicitors. It had, for many months, been open to them to supplement Dr. Golda's report with further medical opinion and with expert opinion regarding medical expertise, services and facilities available in Poland and environmental conditions in that country and their relationship to Rafal's condition. They knew that it was important to present for Officer Bauly's consideration the whole of their case. They appear not to have done so. To suggest, in such circumstances that the Respondent failed to respect the duty to act fairly by failing to disclose the case that the Applicants had to meet was essentially to suggest that the Respondent had a duty to prescribe to the Applicants what it would take to make out their case. I find there is no such duty on the Respondent. The Respondent agreed to reopen the issue of humanitarian and compassionate considerations when there was no obligation to do so. An oral hearing was rejected when no notice had been given of the desire to make oral representations, but it was indicated that written representations would be considered. When these submissions were not forthcoming within a reasonable time, the Respondent reached out to the Applicants to remind them. All submissions provided were considered. Professional advice was solicited and considered. The decision was communicated to the Applicants solicitors and the opportunity to once again bolster the Applicants case was rejected. In all of the circumstances of this case, I conclude that the duty to act fairly was respected.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Was The Decision Reasonable 
 
 On The Evidence Before The 
 
 Immigration Officer?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  On the basis of my review of the evidence before me, I conclude that this question must be answered in the affirmative. I conclude that the decision taken by Officer Bauly was reasonably open to her, particularly having regard to the dearth of evidence as to environmental conditions throughout Poland and their potential impact on the health and well-being of the Applicant Rafal Lemiecha, taking into account medical services and expertise and facilities in that country. Whether I might have reached the same decision on the evidence that was before Officer Bauly is not at issue on judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. Did The Decision Violate The 
 
 Applicant's Rights, Particularly Those 
 
 Of Rafal Lemiecha, Under SS. 7 and 12 
 
 Of The Charter Of Rights And 
 
 Freedoms To Be Free From Cruel 
 
 And Unusual Treatment And To 
 
 Security Of The Person  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  I am grateful to counsel for the Applicants for the argument in depth on this issue that was presented before me, particularly as it related to the interpretation to be given to the laws of Canada and the application thereto of the  
 Charter 
  where the rights of children are at issue, or of a child as was the case in the matter before me.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  Not having found a basis to this point for returning this matter for reconsideration, I find myself in the same position as Cullen, J., in the  
 Nueda 
  case cited above when he stated at page 7 of his reasons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "And finally, not having found a basis for returning this review, I now turn to counsel for the applicant's submission that this Court is under an obligation or duty, in cases where a prima facie case of a  
 Charter 
  infringement has been made out, to substantively review the decision, above and beyond the common law grounds of review. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [25] 
  After examining this submission and counsel for the Respondent's submissions in reply, Cullen, J., concludes in the following terms at page 13:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Even if I were to accept the applicant's position in terms of scope and redress on judicial review, my finding that there was no breach of the applicant's section 7 or 15  
 Charter 
  rights would not allow a further review. Therefore, my decision remains that there is no basis upon which to return this matter for a review. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [26] 
  I reach the same conclusion. I conclude that the evidence properly before me, that being the evidence that was before Officer Bauly, simply does not disclose a breach of the Applicant Rafal Lemiecha's s. 7 or 12  
 Charter 
  rights. There was, in my view, essentially no evidence before Officer Bauly, and therefore before me, regarding any link between conditions in Poland, environmental or otherwise, and Rafal Lemiecha's medical difficulties before he left Poland. There was no evidence regarding changes, if any, in conditions in Poland, environmental or otherwise, since the Lemiechas left Poland that might impact on Rafal Lemiecha's health if he returned to Poland. There was no evidence, only speculation or insinuation, that medical expertise, services and facilities in Poland are inferior to those in Canada, or so inferior as to result in a breach of Rafal Lemiecha's  
 Charter 
  rights if his health were to worsen on a return to Poland.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  For the foregoing reasons, I have dismissed this application for judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

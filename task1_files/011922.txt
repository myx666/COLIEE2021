 Pinard, J. 
 : On March 14, 2011, Luftar Hysa (the "applicant") filed the present appeal, under subsection 14(5) of the  
 Citizenship Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29 (the "Act"), from a decision of Judge Marcel Tremblay, the Citizenship Judge. The latter refused the applicant's application for citizenship due to his failure to meet the residency requirement under paragraph 5(1)( 
 c 
 ) of the Act. During the relevant period set out in paragraph 5(1)( 
 c 
 ) of the Act, the applicant was physically present in Canada for only 173 days, as he was living and working in Mexico, leaving him short 922 days from the required 1,095 days of physical presence in the country. 
 
 
 
 [2] 
  The applicant argues that the Citizenship Judge erred in failing to clearly state the applicable test for residency, in failing to properly apply the  
 Re Koo 
 , [1993] 1 F.C. 286 [ 
 Re Koo 
 ] test to evaluate his centralized mode of existence in Canada, and in failing to provide adequate reasons. I do not agree. Consequently, the appeal is dismissed. 
 
 
 
 [3] 
  This appeal is dismissed on the basis of  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ 
 Martinez-Caro 
 ]. In that case, my colleague Justice Donald J. Rennie thoroughly reviewed the jurisprudence on the residency requirement of paragraph 5(1)( 
 c 
 ) of the Act, and provided a compelling analysis of the relevant applicable principles. I fully adopt his reasoning which lead to the following conclusion contained at paragraphs 52 and 53 of the decision, wherein Mr. Justice Rennie refers to  
 Re Pourghasemi 
 , [1993] F.C.J. No. 232, 62 F.T.R. 122 [ 
 Re Pourghasemi 
 ], and  
 Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re) 
 , [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27: 
 
 
 
 [52] In my view therefore, the interpretation of the residency provision of the  
 Citizenship Act 
  is subject to the standard of correctness and that residency means physical presence in Canada. 
 
 
 
 [53] It is my opinion that  
 Re Pourghasemi 
  is the interpretation that reflects the true meaning, intent and spirit of subsection 5(1)( 
 c 
 ) of the Act:  
 Rizzo 
 , paras 22 and 41. For this reason it cannot be said that the Citizenship Judge erred in applying the  
 Re Pourghasemi 
  test. Furthermore, the Citizenship Judge correctly applied the  
 Re Pourghasemi 
  test in determining that a shortfall of 771 days prevented a finding that 1,095 days of physical presence in Canada had been accumulated. 
 
 
 
 [4] 
  In the case at bar, the Citizenship Judge, in his reasons, clearly indicated that the applicant was absent from Canada a total of 1,287 days. Consequently, the latter did not meet the physical residency requirement under paragraph 5(1)( 
 c 
 ) of the Act, failing to meet the test in  
 Re Pourghasemi 
 . The applicant not having been physically present in Canada for the equivalent of three years, the Citizenship Judge went on to consider whether these absences qualified nonetheless as a period of residence in Canada, considering his centralized mode of existence. 
 
 
 
 [5] 
  In my view, in light of  
 Martinez-Caro 
 , it would have been sufficient for the Citizenship Judge to solely base his decision on  
 Re Pourghasemi 
 , without going on, as he did, to further consider the elements of the test stated in  
 Re Koo 
 . The Citizenship Judge, in the case at bar, was correct in applying the  
 Re Pourghasemi 
  test and in concluding that a presence of only 173 days in Canada was insufficient to establish residency: the applicant had not accumulated 1,095 days of physical presence, as required by paragraph 5(1)( 
 c 
 ) of the Act. Thus, this conclusion as to the applicant's lack of physical presence was sufficient for the Citizenship Judge to refuse the applicant's citizenship application. Moreover, the Citizenship Judge's reasons are sufficient as they clearly allowed the applicant to know why his application for Canadian citizenship was refused: he did not meet the residency requirement under paragraph 5(1)( 
 c 
 ) of the Act, having been absent from Canada for 1,287 days. 
 
 
 
 [6] 
  For the above reasons, the appeal is dismissed. There is no order as to costs.

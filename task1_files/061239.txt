 Summary: 
 
 An Immigration Officer found Gao inadmissible to Canada under s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Immigration Act on the ground that his son suffered from a disability that would place excessive demands on health and social services. Gao applied under s. 18.1 of the Federal Court Act for certiorari to quash the decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, allowed the application and quashed the decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Dubé, J. 
 : The issue in this s. 18.1 application for judicial review ( 
 Federal Court Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended) is whether a writ of certiorari should issue to quash the December 1991 decision of an Immigration Officer which found the applicant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) inadmissible to Canada under s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the  
 Immigration Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-1, as amended ('the  
 Act 
 "), on the ground that his young son ("Qi") suffers from a disability.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. The Law  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  A brief review of the statutory provisions applicable to a finding of medical inadmissibility under the  
 Act 
  and of the administrative process involved will be of assistance for the comprehension of this case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Section 19(1)(a)(ii) of the  
 Act 
  identifies a class of medically inadmissible persons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "19(1) No person shall be granted admission who is a member of any of the following classes:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) persons who are suffering from any disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment as a result of the nature, severity or probable duration of which, in the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (ii) their admission would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [4] 
  At s. 2(1) of the  
 Act 
 , a "medical officer" is defined as:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "a qualified medical practitioner authorized or recognized by order of the Minister of National Health and Welfare as a medical officer for the purposes of this Act. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [5] 
  Section 22 of the  
 Immigration Regulations 
  ("the  
 Regulations 
 ") lists the factors medical officers must consider in arriving at an opinion under s. 19(1)(a)(ii) as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "22. For the purpose of determining ... whether the admission of any person would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services, the following factors shall be considered by a medical officer in relation to the nature, severity or probable duration of any disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment from which the person is suffering, namely,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) any reports made by a medical practitioner with respect to that person;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) the degree to which the disease, disorder, disability or other impairment may be communicated to other persons;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) whether medical surveillance is required for reasons of public health;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) whether sudden incapacity or unpredictable or unusual behaviour may create a danger to public safety;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (e) whether the supply of health or social services that the person may require in Canada is limited to such an extent that  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (i) the use of such services by the person might reasonably be expected to prevent or delay provision of those services to Canadian citizens or permanent residents, or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (ii) the use of such services may not be available or accessible to the person;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (f) whether medical care or hospitalization is required;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (g) whether potential employability or productivity is affected; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (h) whether prompt and effective medical treatment can be provided. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [6] 
  As I understand it, the results of a medical examination completed by a designated medical practitioner for immigration purposes are forwarded to a Health and Welfare medical officer for review. If the officer determines the applicant is inadmissible on medical grounds, the file must be submitted for review to a second medical officer. Should the second officer concur, relevant immigration authorities are so informed by means of a standard official document called a "Medical Notification". This form, signed by the concurring officers, contains the medical opinion which is comprised of two distinct features: a Medical Profile containing coded notations concerning the applicant's condition, prognosis and treatment needs, as well as a narrative component containing the applicant's diagnosis and the medical officers' finding under s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the  
 Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. The Facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  In 1984, Gao, a Chinese citizen, was invited to Canada as a visiting scholar at the University of Victoria and was issued student and employment authorizations. He returned to China in 1985, was allegedly persecuted for his participation in prodemocracy activities, and, in December of that year, reentered Canada on a student visa in order to complete his studies.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  In 1986, Gao's wife and his son Qi, born in China in 1982, arrived in Canada on visitors' visas. Both had been assessed by Health and Welfare officials in Shanghai. Qi had been found healthy and assessed M1 ("no health impairment sufficient to prevent admission under [s. 19(1)(a)]" ( 
 Immigration Manual, Selection and Control 
 , vol. 1, c. 8, "Medical Requirements and Examinations", Appendix "A"). In the fall of 1987 Gao informed immigration officials Qi was attending a special school because of developmental delay. Qi, then 5, was required to undergo a second medical assessment. Dr. Kelly Chu ("Dr. Chu"), the examining physician in Victoria, diagnosed "mental retardation", with no degree of severity specified, and characterized Qi's prognosis as "guarded" in view of that finding. Dr. Chu's report was forwarded to the Ottawa Health and Welfare section responsible for medical assessments for immigration services ("HW").  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  In January 1988, an opinion on the prescribed Medical Notification form was issued, signed by two concurring medical officers as required by s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the  
 Act 
 . The concurring officer was Dr. M.J. Ferrari ("Dr. Ferrari"), Assistant Director of the HW department. The full narrative contained in this Medical Notification read:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Mental Retardation  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Mentally retarded child requiring special education. Will consume scarce resources, and likely to displace a Canadian with similar needs. Inadmissible under 19(1) (a)(ii). <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [10] 
  The coded notations of Qi's medical profile, the second component of the Medical Notification, and the corresponding classifications (Appendix "A", supra, note 3) provided as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "H1: 'No risk to public health ...';  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "D6: 'Requires, or may well require, special home care indefinitely as well as regular health and/or social supervision';  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "D8: 'Requires, or may well require, health or social services, the supply of which is at present so limited in Canada that: (i) the additional burden of cases from abroad might prevent or delay provision of these services to Canadian residents; or (ii) the services may not be accessible or available to the applicant';  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "T5: 'No effective treatment exists or is available';  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "S1: 'No surveillance required';  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "E5: 'Unemployable or unproductive';  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "M7: 'Inadmissible (Health or Social Services). Has a condition which causes excessive demands on health or social services, and which is not likely to respond to treatment. Inadmissible as A19(1)(a) applies'." (Appendix "A" describes the "M" classification as denoting the applicant's overall medical status, or the summation of findings under H, D, T, S and E.)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  Gao was provided with a copy of the January 1988 Medical Notification. In July of that year Gao claimed Convention refugee status for himself, his wife and Qi, which claim fell under "backlog" rules. In February 1990, he was called to a preliminary interview in order to determine whether there were sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds on which to process the family for landing. As a result of this interview, Qi, now 8, was referred for a third medical assessment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  Qi was examined by Dr. G. Chew ("Dr. Chew"). Dr. Chew's ensuing report to HW made no mention of mental retardation, and indicated Qi's prognosis was "good". In May 1990, HW in Ottawa communicated with Dr. Chew requesting extensive specific additional information with respect to Qi's mental development. Dr. Chew referred Qi to the Glendale Lodge Society, where an intensive assessment was carried out in August 1990, including medical, psychological, hearing and speech profiles. The ensuing exhaustive report ("the Glendale report") was forwarded to HW in September 1990. Gao also received a copy, which he interpreted as a positive accounting of Qi's developmental progress and future prognosis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  Gao inquired into the status of his application for landing several times in the months following the Glendale report. A March 1991 letter from Immigration officials in reply to his two February 1991 letters reads in part:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "We understand your eagerness to have your case resolved and can assure you that we are working as quickly as possible to bring it to a conclusion. Presently we are waiting for the results of your son's medical examination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "We expect the results from Health and Welfare shortly and will then be able to advise you as to the status of your case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "We hope to be contacting you soon with more information concerning your case. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [14] 
  In September 1991, Gao initiated further inquiries in person, and was told that Qi's medical status might prove problematic for his application for permanent residence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  In December 1991, Gao received a "fill-in-the blanks" form letter from the Canada Immigration Centre signed "S. Reid for Manager", informing him as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Although it has been found that your case has sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds for processing your application in Canada, you have been found to be inadmissible to Canada pursuant to s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the  
 Immigration Act 
 , in that you:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 have a dependant [sic] son, Qi Hui Gao, who suffer [sic] a disability which, in the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer, would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health and social services.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Therefore, your application for permanent residence in Canada has been denied." (underlining designates handwritten fill-in)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Leave to apply for judicial review of this decision was granted by Denault, J., in March 1992 (T-1-92).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. Affidavit Evidence  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  The evidence submitted on behalf of the respondent ("the Minister") consists of the affidavit and exhibits thereto of Cheryl Shapka, Operations Supervisor at the Canada Immigration Centre in New Westminster, B.C. According to this affidavit HW in Ottawa had received the Chew/Glendale reports on December 12, 1990, and had assessed Qi as M5:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Inadmissible (Subject to Review, Health or Social Services):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 'Has a condition which is likely to cause demands on health or social services to such an extent that the applicant is at present inadmissible under A19(1)(a)(ii) but for which the expected response to treatment is such that future admission could be considered ...' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [18] 
  Ms. Shapka also attested that immigration was notified of that assessment on November 18, 1991. (No explanation is given of the 11 month delay between the HW assessment and its communication to immigration.)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  According to Gao's supplementary affidavit he was not made aware of either a December 1990 assessment of the Glendale report by HW, or its communication by HW to immigration in November 1991, and received no second Medical Notification arising from that assessment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  The only evidence of a December 1990 review is a letter addressed to counsel for the Minister from Dr. Ferrari dated February 12, 1992 (Shapka affidavit, Exhibit "C"), over a month following Gao's initiation of s. 82.1 proceedings. The purpose of this letter was to provide counsel with all of Qi's medical reports. It states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 " 
 As you will note he [Qi] was assessed M5 because of the possibility of his improvement over time.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "When the additional reports arrived in 1990 ... they were reviewed and the case was discussed at a M.O.'s conference. It was decided at the time that  
 there had not been sufficient improvement to warrant a change in assessment. A note on file reads 'If Immigration request a further assessment, will Be M5' - dated December 12, 1990.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "It will be clear, I think, that unless this child improves significantly he will never be self-sufficient and will always require some type of assistance and supervision. He will therefore make excessive demands on our social services." (emphasis added)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  As Gao's Supplementary Affidavit points out, Dr. Ferrari's claim that Qi had been assessed  
 M5 
  is inaccurate, as the January 1988 Medical Notification had assessed Qi as  
 M7 
 . The file contains no documentary evidence of any communication between HW and immigration in November 1991 informing the latter of the HW assessment of the Glendale report. There is no evidence that the Immigration Officer received or reviewed the Glendale report.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. The Parties' Submissions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  Counsel for Gao presented two related lines of argument. The first is that Gao was denied procedural fairness in the decision-making process of immigration officials, as defined by the Supreme Court of Canada ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 671; 78 C.L.L.C. 14,181;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.C.C.(2d) 353; 106 D.L.R. (3d) 385; 13 C.R.(3d) 1), and by the Federal Court of Appeal ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  According to this argument, the "positive" 1990 Glendale report negated the 1988 Medical Notification. Thus, if the decision of the Immigration Officer was based on the 1988 Medical Notification, Gao was entitled to be advised of that fact and to be allowed to adduce the subsequent positive Glendale report. If the decision was based on a negative assessment of the Glendale report, Gao was entitled to be advised of the reasons for the negative assessment and for the conclusion that Qi's needs would place excessive demands on health and social services.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  In short, the Immigration Officer owed a duty of fairness to consider all relevant reports, to inform Gao of a negative assessment and to provide him an opportunity to counter it. Gao was entitled to expect, particularly in the wake of the March 1991 letter, that he would be informed of further developments and would have the opportunity to present his case, if necessary, before the final decision was made. Moreover, 16 months had elapsed between the Glendale report and the inadmissibility decision, with no intervening request by the Immigration Officer for further examination of Qi.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  The Immigration Officer's decision gave no indication as to the grounds for its conclusion. HW's purported M5 assessment of December 1990 was inconsistent with the assessments of M7 and T5 included in the 1988 Medical Notification. The M5 assessment states that future admission to Canada could be considered because of the "expected response to treatment". On the other hand, the T5 and M7 assessments imply that no treatment was available or likely to succeed and that the finding of inadmissibility was final. Thus, the effect of the Immigration Officer's decision was to downgrade Qi from M5 to M7 without justification or explanation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  Gao's second argument is that the Immigration Officer's decision was patently unreasonable, on the ground that, although the positive Glendale assessment had been undertaken at the request of HW for immigration purposes, no second medical opinion had been issued since the January 1988 Medical Notification. The Glendale report did not support the medical profile on that Medical Notification, the HW assessment was inconsistent with the medical profile on that Medical Notification, and thus the medical evidence was conflicting and contradictory.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Further, there was no evidence that the Immigration Officer had given separate consideration to the Glendale report. The only evidence before the court was Dr. Ferrari's letter indicating HW had considered the report. Even if the court accepted that letter as evidence that HW had considered the Glendale report, the letter was not a medical opinion under the  
 Act 
 , it contradicted the 1988 Medical Notification, and gave no indication that the factors enumerated under s. 22 of the  
 Regulations 
  were taken into account in arriving at the M5 assessment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  According to  
 Immigration Manual 
  procedures, the medical officers assessing the Glendale report had to consider each s. 22 factor and to indicate what Qi's new medical profile was under the M5 overall assessment. There was thus no evidence before the Immigration Officer to support the view that Qi would place "excessive demands" on health or social services, as required for a finding of inadmissibility under s. 19(1)(a)(ii). In addition it was, still according to counsel, not only unfair but unreasonable for the Immigration Officer to have, in effect, downgraded Qi from M5 to M7.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  Naturally, counsel for the Minister did not accept these two arguments. With respect to procedural fairness, she claimed the process leading to the December 1991 decision was fair: the 1988 opinion was reasonable in light of the available material and the 1990 Glendale report confirmed the 1988 diagnosis. She emphasized that Gao had not been denied an opportunity to make representations in Qi's behalf, but had simply never asked to be heard. He had inquired only about the results of HW's assessment of the Glendale report. Gao had been aware of Qi's condition, of the 1988 Medical Notification, of the 1990 Glendale report, and of the possibility that Qi's condition might have a negative impact on the family's chances for admission to Canada. He could have made representations had he wished to.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  She also submitted that the court ought not to interfere with a medical diagnosis. The 1988 Medical Notification was valid in law, and it was not patently unreasonable for the Immigration Officer to have relied on it. The  
 Immigration Manual 
  is not law, and the Minister was under no legal obligation to produce a second Medical Notification following the Glendale report. The Glendale report did not annihilate the 1988 Medical Notification: it expressed concern that Qi would continue to need some assistance and it was not patently unreasonable to conclude that this constituted excessive demands on social services. There was no evidence that s. 22 factors had not been taken into account. In addition, the Immigration Officer was not obliged to provide reasons for the decision of inadmissibility. Finally, that decision did not prevent Gao from seeking to stay in Canada by some other means, nor did it preempt other recourses available to him.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  Counsel for the Minister concluded Gao had not met the burden of proof of demonstrating that the Immigration Officer had committed a reviewable error.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 5. Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  Most of the case law relating to medical inadmissibility decisions by visa or Immigration Officers has issued from appellate bodies (from the former Immigration Appeal Board, the current Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board, and, on appeal from decisions of those two bodies, from the Federal Court of Appeal). The general principles arising from these cases are of course relevant to a judicial review application seeking to quash an Immigration Officer's decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  The governing principle arising from this body of jurisprudence is that reviewing or appellate courts are not competent to make findings of fact related to the medical diagnosis, but are competent to review the evidence to determine whether the medical officers' opinion is reasonable in the circumstances of the case ( 
 Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). The reasonableness of a medical opinion is to be assessed not only as of the time it was given, but also as of the time it was relied upon by the Immigration Officer, since it is that decision which is being reviewed or appealed ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). The grounds of unreasonableness include incoherence or inconsistency ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  evidence ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , note 12,  
 Le 
 , supra,  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  stipulated in s. 22 of the  
 Regulations 
  ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , note 12)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  Applying these considerations to the case at bar, I find that the medical opinion of January 1988 was unreasonable at the time it was relied on by the Immigration Officer in December 1991, and that the Immigration Officer's decision of Qi's inadmissibility based on that opinion was patently unreasonable. It is apparent, from the March 1991 letter to Gao, that immigration officials were awaiting HW's assessment of the Glendale report in order to arrive at a decision. When it was received in November 1991, HW's M5 assessment was inconsistent with the M7 assessment of 1988. It most certainly was not a "confirmation" of it as submitted on behalf of the Minister. Thus, the decision of inadmissibility was made despite the contradictory HW assessment based on the more recent Glendale report which indicated the January 1988 Medical Notification was, in fact, no longer reasonable (as Gao's counsel pointed out, the M5 assessment is also inconsistent with the T5 notation appearing on the January 1988 notification).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  This contradictory information should, in my view, have alerted the officer to the need for further investigation. He or she should at least have called for an updated examination of Qi and a full second medical opinion that would take into account all the factors specified under s. 22 of the  
 Regulations 
 . There is no evidence these factors were considered as required, and no evidence in particular that Qi's needs would place " 
 excessive 
  demands" on educational facilities in British Columbia, assuming such services may be deemed to be "social services" (in  
 Le 
 , supra, note 14, the I.A.B. noted that it may be public schools supplying courses for handicapped children are not "social services" for purposes of s. 19(1)(a)(ii), but was not required to decide the issue).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  Turning now to the fairness issue, I find that in these particular circumstances, Gao was owed more than an abstract opportunity to make representations to the Immigration Officer. His last information was the rather hopeful Glendale report, followed by the March 1991 letter from immigration to the effect that "we hope to be contacting you soon with more information". Then came the December 1991 decision finding the applicant inadmissible. Gao was not given a fair opportunity to make submissions before that decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  Consequently, I am of the view that the Immigration Officer failed in his or her duty to act fairly. The circumstances are analogous to those of the  
 Muliadi 
  case (supra). There a visa officer denied an application for permanent residence on the basis of a negative third party assessment of the applicant's proposed business venture, which assessment was not disclosed to the applicant prior to the decision. The court found as follows (at pp. 216-217):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In the circumstances ... he should have had an opportunity of meeting the negative assessment ... before it was acted upon by the visa officer, for upon that assessment his application turned. The duty of fairness extends to this kind of case. In this I would adopt the views expressed ... in  
 In re H.K. (An Infant) 
 , [1967] 2 Q.B. 617, at page 630:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 '[...] [E]ven if an immigration officer is not in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity, he must at any rate give the immigrant an opportunity of satisfying him in the matters of the subsection, and for that purpose let the immigrant know what his immediate impression is so that the immigrant can disabuse him. [...]'  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Had the appellant been informed of that assessment before it was decided to reject that application, he might have been able to look into the matter and, possibly, to disabuse the visa officer of his view. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [38] 
  I believe the duty to act fairly expressed in these reasons is fully germane to the circumstances of the instant case. Consequently, the application is allowed and the decision of the Immigration Officer dated December 2, 1991 is quashed, with costs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

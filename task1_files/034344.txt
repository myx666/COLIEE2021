Strayer, J.
: This is an application under s. 41 of the
Privacy Act
submitted to the court in writing pursuant to rule 324.
[2]
The applicant was convicted of first degree murder in 1984 and is currently serving a life sentence at William Head Institution in British Columbia. In 1989 he applied to the Correctional Service of Canada for personal information concerning himself held in nine different information banks of that Service. In January 1990, all of the requested information in some of the banks was released by the Correctional Service without exemption. With respect to other information banks, some information was released but exemptions were claimed for the rest. The applicant complained to the Privacy Commissioner and as a result of his investigation further information was provided. The Privacy Commissioner agreed that the remaining information being withheld was properly exempted under the
Privacy Act
. On April 5, 1991 the applicant filed a notice of motion seeking review under s. 41 of the decisions of the Correctional Service of Canada withholding the remaining information. This notice of motion seeks certiorari to quash the refusal of access and mandamus requiring the Solicitor General to disclose personal information requested by the applicant and denied to him. The special procedure provided under s. 41 of the
Privacy Act
for seeking a review in this court of a refusal to give access to personal information does not contemplate the use of prerogative writs or remedies in the nature of prerogative writs. Section 41 simply allows an individual to "apply to the court for a review of the matter" and s. 48 provides that this court
"shall, if it determines that the head of the institution is not authorized under this Act to refuse to disclose the personal information, order the head of the institution to disclose the personal information ..."
I shall simply treat this as an application under s. 41 without regard to the special criteria for prerogative writs. The respondent has made no issue of this procedural point in his submissions.
[3]
The respondent obtained a consent order allowing him to file an affidavit of a public servant on a confidential basis explaining more fully the nature of the exemptions claimed and attaching the documents in respect to which the exemption is claimed. Pursuant to the confidentiality order this affidavit is available only to the court and to counsel. Counsel for the applicant has reviewed the confidential affidavit and has made submissions on it. He has agreed that certain items were properly exempted and has made very clear submissions as to why certain other items should not be exempted.
[4]
In providing my reasons I must, of course, have regard to s. 46 of the
Privacy Act
which enjoins the court to avoid the disclosure of information that the head of a government institution is authorized to refuse to disclose. I must not, therefore, in explaining why I have upheld the respondent's reliance on certain exemptions reveal the very information which I find to have been properly withheld.
[5]
There is very little jurisprudence on the nature of the court's review power under s. 48 of the
Privacy Act
, nor has that subject been seriously addressed in argument in this case. I will therefore go no further than necessary for present purposes in trying to define that role. It is true that s. 47 places the burden of proof on the head of a government institution to show that he is authorized to refuse to disclose the personal information in question. The nature of this burden is adequately clear when the institution head simply invokes a mandatory exemption: in such a case the court may look at the
Act
and the material exempted and determine whether as a matter of law that material comes within the description of material which the
Act
requires exempted. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 501 (F.C.T.D.); and see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 1 F.T.R. 317 (F.C.T.D.) insofar as it concerns nondiscretionary refusals to disclose under the
Access to Information Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1.) It is less clear when the institution head invokes a discretionary exemption such as those invoked here under ss. 24, 25, and 26 of the
Act
which read as follows:
"24. The head of a government institution
may
refuse to disclose any personal information requested under subsection 12(1) that was collected or obtained by the Canadian Penitentiary Service, the National Parole Service or the National Parole Board while the individual who made the request was under sentence for an offence against any Act of Parliament, if the disclosure could reasonably be expected to
(a) lead to a serious disruption of the individual's institutional, parole or mandatory supervision program; or
(b) reveal information about the individual originally obtained on a promise of confidentiality, express or implied.
"25. The head of a government institution
may
refuse to disclose any personal information requested under subsection 12(1) the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to threaten the safety of individuals.
"26. The head of a government institution
may
refuse to disclose any personal information requested under subsection 12(1) about an individual other than the individual who made the request, and shall refuse to disclose such information where the disclosure is prohibited under s. 8." (Emphasis added)
It will be seen that these exemptions require two decisions by the head of an institution: first, a factual determination as to whether the material comes within the description of material potentially subject to being withheld from disclosure; and second, a discretionary decision as to whether that material should nevertheless be disclosed.
[6]
The first type of factual decision is one which, I believe, the court can review and in respect of which it can substitute its own conclusion. This is subject to the need, I believe, for a measure of deference to the decisions of those whose institutional responsibilities put them in a better position to judge the matter. I include in this category decisions with respect to such matters as to whether disclosure could reasonably be expected to disrupt an individual's institutional program (see s. 24(a)) or could reasonably be expected to threaten the safety of individuals (see s. 25). I have reviewed such factual decisions taken by the Correctional Service of Canada and am satisfied that with two small exceptions they should not be disturbed. Some of my reasons for so concluding are set out below.
[7]
The second type of decision is purely discretionary. In my view in reviewing such a decision the court should not itself attempt to exercise the discretion de novo but should look at the document in question and the surrounding circumstances and simply consider whether the discretion appears to have been exercised in good faith and for some reason which is rationally connected to the purpose for which the discretion was granted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 191, the Federal Court of Appeal, in exercising similar powers under s. 49 of the
Access to Information Act
held that this court can review the exercise of discretion by a head of an institution in refusing to disclose, to ensure that it is exercised "in accordance with recognized legal principles" and "in accord with the confirming statute". Stress was put on the policy and object of the
Access to Information Act
whose "general rule is disclosure". For reasons not directly pertinent to the present case the Court of Appeal did strike down the exercise of discretion in question there and referred the matter back to the C.M.H.C. for a proper exercise of discretion. (It will be noted that the court did not itself purport to exercise the discretion). In the present case the somewhat different objects of the
Privacy Act
must be kept in mind. They are stated in s. 2 as follows:
"2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the present laws of Canada that protect the privacy of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves held by a government institution and that provide individuals with a right of access to that information."
The primary purpose is to protect privacy, and the right of access given to any person to his own data must as much as possible be exercised so as to respect the right of others to the privacy of their data.
[8]
With these considerations in mind I have reviewed carefully the documents withheld, and the submissions of the parties. In reviewing the factual decisions taken by the Correctional Service, I have concluded that only two further documents should be disclosed, namely pp. 110 and 150 in the information bank CSC/P-PU-030 (Case Management Community). The Correctional Service invoked a mandatory exemption under s. 26 of the
Privacy Act
on the basis that these documents contained personal information regarding individuals other than the applicant. I have reviewed these documents in relation to the definition of "personal information" in s. 2 of the
Privacy Act
and I am unable to see how they reveal any information within that definition, at least not the information which the respondent's claim for exemption asserts that they reveal. The only information I can see that might be revealed by inference would be that of age, simply because a different part of the form in question would have been filled out by a person under the age of majority. But the respondent has not asserted an exemption based on personal information related to age.
[9]
Counsel for the applicant has questioned whether certain information provided by a provincial agency was provided in confidence since no specific request for confidentiality is recorded as having been made at the time the information was provided. He points out that s. 19(1)(c) only protects such information if it "was obtained in confidence", no mention being made of an implied understanding of confidence, whereas s. 24(b) protects information "originally obtained on a promise of confidentiality, expressed or implied". I think that the two provisions quoted deal with rather different situations, the former involving regular channels of communication between federal and provincial governmental authorities. I am satisfied from looking at the document in question that in the circumstances the provincial agency would have assumed that the information was to be treated on a confidential basis even though an express request for confidentiality was not made until later.
[10]
With respect to some materials counsel for the applicant has contended that with certain deletions of personal information the remainder of these documents could and should be disclosed. I have not been assisted by any doctrinal argument on the availability, or obligation, of severance for the purposes of disclosure under the
Privacy Act
. Section 25 of the
Access to Information Act
specifically requires the head of an institution, "
notwithstanding any other provision of this Act
" to disclose any part of a record that can reasonably be severed from a part which is not to be disclosed. This specific obligation is important in heightening the obligation to disclose under that
Act
. (See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at p. 190.) As far as I can ascertain there is no comparable provision in the
Privacy Act
. Assuming, without deciding, that reasonable disclosure under the latter
Act
involves the release of materials where deletions can be made to render them unobjectionable to disclosure, I have carefully examined the documents in respect to which counsel for the applicant has made this submission. I am satisfied that the documents could not be rendered harmless by selective deletions and I therefore conclude that the Correctional Service was authorized to withhold the documents in their entirety.
[11]
Counsel for the applicant also contends that certain documents should be released because the failure to release them enables the Correctional Service to conceal the fact that it has conveyed personal information concerning the applicant to third parties. I would make two observations on this. Firstly, it is by no means self-apparent that such communications were contrary to the
Privacy Act
. It is arguable for example that the communications in question might be justified under s. 8(2)(a) or (m) of the
Privacy Act
. I cannot make such determinations without more information and submissions. Secondly, I fail to see how the desirability of disclosing breaches of the
Privacy Act
by the respondent would justify me ordering him to commit other breaches of the
Privacy Act
. The question I have to decide under s. 48 is as to whether the respondent was authorized to withhold the material it did withhold. I know of no doctrine to the effect that authorization to withhold ceases if to withhold the material would conceal other violations of the
Act
.
[12]
Having looked at the documents in question with respect to which the Correctional Service of Canada has invoked its discretionary powers of refusal to disclose, I am also satisfied that the discretion was exercised within a legitimate range contemplated by the
Act
. The discretion appears to me to have been exercised after due consideration of the facts, consistently with the purposes of the
Act
, and for no improper or irrelevant purpose.
[13]
I might add that while from a careful review of the materials and the circumstances I am satisfied the respondent has shown that the decisions of the Correctional Service were authorized, I believe that heads of institutions who seek to justify their decisions in a s. 41 proceeding should bolster their exemption claims with as much information as possible. More information in support of those decisions here would have been helpful to the court.
[14]
The application will therefore be dismissed except with respect to pp. 110 and 150 of information bank CSC/P-PU-030 (Case Management Community). Disclosure of those materials need not be made for a period of 30 days after the date of this order in case the respondent wishes to file an appeal. In such case these materials should remain confidential together with the remainder of the confidential affidavit of Georges Pinatel dated December 19, 1991. The latter affidavit shall in its entirety remain confidential and held by the court until the expiry of 30 days or, if an appeal should be launched, until the disposition of that appeal. If no appeal is launched within 30 days, the affidavit should be disposed of in accordance with the order of the Senior Prothonotary of December 11, 1991.
Application allowed in part.

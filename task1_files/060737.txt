 Admission, refugees - Persecution, protec­tion of country of nationality - Bouianova was born near Moscow in Russia, then a part of the U.S.S.R. - She lived in Latvia for 14 years before coming to Canada and claiming refugee status on the basis of statelessness and persecution against Rus­sian nationals in Latvia - She was entitled to Russian citizenship but had not obtained it because she had not asked Russia to stamp her U.S.S.R. passport - The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, affirmed a refugee board decision holding that she was not a convention refugee because she was a Russian citizen and there was no evidence of persecution against her in Russia - The court stated that not asking for the passport stamp did not deprive Bouianova of her Russian nationality.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Rothstein, J. 
 : The issue in this case is whether the applicant is a Convention refugee. Subsection 2(1) of the  
 Immigration Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, as amended, defines Convention refugee:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "2(1) In this Act,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 'Convention refugee' means any person who  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (i) is outside the country of the person's nationality and is unable or, by reasons of that fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country, or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (ii) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of the person's former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear is unwilling to return to that country, and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) has not ceased to be a Convention refugee by virtue of subs. (2),  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 but does not include any person to whom the Convention does not apply pursuant to section E or F of Article 1 thereof, which sections are set out in the schedule to this Act; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  The applicant was born in Komi, A.S.S.R. near Moscow in the former U.S.S.R. some 31 years ago. The applicant's place of birth is located in what is now Russia. Before coming to Canada she had lived in Latvia for 14 years. She came to Canada in December, 1991 and in January, 1992 made a claim for refugee status.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  On August 24, 1992 at Calgary, a credible basis hearing to consider the appellant's refugee claim was conducted by a Panel consisting of an Immigration Adjudicator accompanied by a representative of the Immigration and Refugee Board. At the hearing, the applicant submitted that she had a well-founded fear of persecution in Latvia, based on discrimination against ethnic Russians in Latvia. Latvia had been her country of former habitual residence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  However, the Panel found that the applicant was a citizen of the Russian Federation and that there was no evidence that she had a well-founded fear of persecution in Russia. It therefore found that she did not qualify as a Convention refugee.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  This application raises two issues:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Did the Panel err in finding the applicant to be a citizen of Russia rather than a stateless person?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Did the Panel exceed its jurisdiction in making a determination on the point?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The evidence before the Panel was that the Russian Embassy had been asked by the Department of Employment and Immigration to answer specific questions with respect to Russian nationality. The relevant questions and answers are as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Q.	If a person was born in what is now considered the Russian Republic, but at the time was considered U.S.S.R., and has lived in another republic for the majority of their life, is that person considered a citizen of the Russian Republic? 
 
  A.	This person is a Russian citizen unless he wants to become a citizen of another state.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  Q.	With regard to the questions I have asked, does a person need to make an application of any sort or is the acquisition of Russian citizenship automatic? 
 
  A.	The person has to send us his passport with a letter requesting the Russian citizenship and we shall put the necessary stamp in his passport. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [7] 
  Counsel for the applicant argues that the applicant is not a Russian citizen because she must apply requesting Russian citizenship and have her U.S.S.R. passport stamped. He says that she has not done this and therefore, she is stateless.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  In my view , the applicant, by simply making a request and submitting her passport to be stamped, becomes a citizen of Russia. On the evidence before me, there is no discretion by the Russian officials to refuse her Russian citizenship. I do not think the necessity of making an application, which in these circumstances is nothing more than a mere formality, means that a person does not have a country of nationality just because they choose not to make such an application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  There is no evidence in this case of this applicant having a well-founded fear of persecution in Russia.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the court stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The court in the  
 Ward 
  case, on this issue, was unanimous in finding that a 'refugee claimant must establish that he is unable or unwilling to avail himself of all of his countries of nationality' if his claim is to be upheld. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [11] 
  The applicant says that  
 Akl 
 , (supra), does not apply in the present case because  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  the applicant had been a citizen of two countries and simply did not wish to return to one of the countries although he had no fear of persecution in that country, while in the case at bar the applicant does not hold Russian citizenship. However, in my opinion, counsel for the applicant construes the  
 Akl 
  decision too narrowly. In my view, the decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  is wide enough to encompass the situation of an applicant who, by reason of her place of birth, is entitled to be a citizen of a particular country, upon compliance with requirements that are mere formalities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  In my view the status of statelessness is not one that is optional for an applicant. The condition of not having a country of nationality must be one that is beyond the power of the applicant to control. Otherwise, a person could claim a statelessness merely by renouncing his or her former citizenship. This would then render unnecessary those provisions of the definition of Convention refugee that require that a person demonstrate an inability or unwillingness by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution to return to the person's country of former citizenship. The definition should not be interpreted in such a manner as to render some of its words unnecessary or redundant. The application in this case has advanced an excessively technical interpretation of the definition of convention refugee. In my opinion, the definition should not be applied based upon such a technical approach.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  In this case, the applicant is, by virtue of her place of birth, entitled to be a citizen of Russia. I do not see merit to the applicant's argument on this point. (Having regard to the changes that have taken place in the former U.S.S.R. in the last few years, there are obviously consequent new arrangements for citizenship in the countries that formerly comprise the U.S.S.R. Such arrangements in the case of Russia entitled the applicant to be a citizen of that country by filing an application and submitting her passport for stamping and doing nothing more. This, in my view, is sufficient to take her out of the category of "not having a country of nationality".)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  The applicant's second argument is that the Panel should not have considered what counsel has termed a legal question. Counsel relies on  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  applicant says the Panel should not have considered is the very issue that is being advanced for consideration by the court in this case. Counsel was asked what prejudice would be suffered by the applicant by reason of the Panel having decided the question and an appeal having been taken from that decision. Counsel did not satisfy me that there was any obvious prejudice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  I am of the view that there has been no miscarriage of justice in this case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Counsel for the applicant requested that, pursuant to section 83(1) of the  
 Immigration Act 
 , I certify a question for the Federal Court of Appeal as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Did the Panel err in ruling that the applicant was a citizen of the new state of Russia rather than finding her to be a 'stateless' person. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [17] 
  In my opinion it would not be appropriate to certify this question for the Court of Appeal. This issue arises because the applicant has simply not taken a step which is nothing more than a mere formality to becoming a citizen of Russia. In my view, this does not raise a serious question of general importance contemplated by subs. 83(1) which requires a decision by the Federal Court of Appeal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  The application for judicial review is dismissed. There shall be no award as to costs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

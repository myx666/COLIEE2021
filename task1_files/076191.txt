INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [Act] for judicial review of the decision of a Designated Immigration Officer [Officer], dated 16 October 2012 [Decision], which refused the Applicant's application for permanent residence in Canada under the Economic Class as a provincial nominee under subsection 11(1) of the Act and section 87 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [Regulations]. The Officer found that the Applicant was inadmissible for misrepresentation under subsection 40(1)(a).
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicant is a 24 year old citizen of India who applied to the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program [SINP] in February 2009 as a carpenter. His application was approved by the Province of Saskatchewan on 11 January 2011, and he then submitted his application for permanent residence through the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi [Embassy] on 21 February 2011. While the Province of Saskatchewan selects successful applicants under the SINP, Citizenship and Immigration Canada [CIC], through specifically designated officers, makes the final decision on their admission to Canada, including the determination of whether they are inadmissible to Canada under the Act.
[3]
As part of his SINP application, the Applicant provided a sworn statement dated 15 January 2009 from an employer, Jit Singh. This statement indicated that the Applicant was working for Mr. Singh's company, Panesar Timber Store, as a carpenter specializing in cabinet making, from 20 May 2008 "till date". The Applicant also submitted Experience Certificates signed by Mr. Singh with his permanent residence application stating that he had worked at Panesar Timber Store.
[4]
On 1 August 2011, an employee from the Embassy contacted Jit Singh in an attempt to verify the Applicant's employment and experience. Two land lines listed on the letterhead for Panesar Timber Store were not in service, but the Embassy employee, who spoke Punjabi, was successful in reaching a person who claimed to be Jit Singh at the mobile phone number listed on that letterhead. Mr. Singh stated that Panesar Timber Store was in the business of trading in wood to be used for doors and door frames, and had never been in the business of making cabinets or other furniture. He stated that they "only make door frames and doors." Mr. Singh also stated that there was no one with the Applicant's name working for him. After being informed that it was the Embassy calling, Mr. Singh again stated that no one with the Applicant's name had ever worked for him. The Embassy employee ended the call and entered the code TVE-2 (Employment confirmed fraudulent) on the Applicant's file.
[5]
On 25 July 2012, the Applicant sent a letter to the Embassy stating that he had changed his employment, and attached a letter from a new employer, Devgan Wood Works, also stating that he was working as a carpenter.
[6]
On 14 August 2012, a Visa Officer at the Embassy sent a "procedural fairness" letter to the Applicant informing him of the phone conversation with Mr. Singh, and stating that it was therefore reasonable to believe that the Applicant had provided fraudulent experience letters. The Visa Officer outlined the provisions of the Act dealing with inadmissibility due to misrepresentation, and gave the Applicant 30 days to respond to the concerns raised in writing, after which a decision would be made. The letter also stated that the Applicant's recent change of employers was "of no relevance," as he was nominated by the province of Saskatchewan based on his experience with Panesar Timber Store, which was now deemed to be misrepresented.
[7]
The Applicant responded with a letter dated 1 September 2012 stating that the information in the procedural fairness letter was incorrect, and attaching another sworn and notarized statement from Jit Singh, dated 30 August 2012. The latter emphatically denied the facts alleged in the procedural fairness letter, reaffirmed that the Applicant had worked for Panesar Timber Store from 15 June 2007 to 15 December 2007 and again from 20 May 2008 to 3 February 2012, and stated that this work involved "manufacture of door and window frames, kitchen cupboards and cabinets in the bedrooms, to be precise and miscellaneous woodwork jobs in residential flats." Mr. Singh wrote that he did not recall receiving a phone call from the Embassy, and speculated that the call "may have been received by a person who did not know Varinder Singh Bhamra or was on inimical relations with him and happened to be then present in [Mr. Singh's] office."
[8]
On 16 December 2012 a letter was sent to the Applicant informing him that he was found to be inadmissible to Canada for misrepresentation, and denying his application for permanent residence.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[9]
The Decision consists of the 16 December 2012 letter and the notes on the Applicant's file in the Global Case Management System [GCMS notes].
[10]
The letter stated that under subsection 40(1)(a) of the Act, a foreign national is inadmissible for misrepresentation for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration of the Act, and that under subsection 40(2)(a) such inadmissibility continues for a period of two years. The letter stated that having considered all of the information submitted and collected, including the Applicant's response to the Embassy's letter of 14 August 2012, the Officer had concluded that the Applicant had misrepresented or withheld material facts related to his work experience. The further documents submitted did not overcome the concerns raised by the telephone verification as the Officer was "not satisfied that the person that our office spoke with during the phone verification was not Mr. Jit Singh, proprietor of Panesar Timber Store." The Officer found that the Applicant had misrepresented a material fact that could have induced errors in the administration of the Act, because an officer could have been led to believe that the Applicant's stated work experience was genuine and that he met the provincial nominee requirements. As a result of this finding of misrepresentation, the letter states, the Applicant is inadmissible to Canada for a period of two years from the date of the letter.
[11]
The GCMS notes include further information on the processing of the Applicant's file. An entry of 21 September 2012 by a user identified as "ACO1326", following a review of the Applicant's response to the procedural fairness letter, states in part:
... Mr. Bhamra has provided a statement from the Proprietor of Panesar Timber Store, Mr Jit Singh stating that PA is employed with his company. The statement from Mr. Singh denies ever having received a call from our office. The verification call was made to the same phone number that is listed on both the letterhead of the experience certificate and that of the new statement from employer ( ...). The person who conducted the verification call confirmed with the responding party at the beginning of the call that they were Jit Singh, owner of Panesar Timber Store. There was no reason or incentive for the responding party to identify himself as Jit Singh if in fact he was not. The Respondent denied on several occasions during the call that he knew or employed Varinder Singh Bhamra. The Respondent also twice confirmed that the company only makes door frames and doors. Furthermore, the respondent did identify his three employees, which did not include the applicant. Two of the employees that the respondent noted are also mentioned as employees in the recent written statement provided. The call ended by advising the respondent the call was coming from the High Commission of Canada and requesting a final confirmation that Varinder Singh Bhamra works or has ever worked for Mr Jit Singh, and the respondent confirmed this person has never worked for him. No indication was given by the respondent at the time of the verification call that he might not be able to provide reliable information about these facts. The respondent of the verification phone call would have had no reason or incentive to pretend to be Mr Jit Singh, proprietor of Panesar Timber Store, or to provide our office with incorrect information pertaining to Mr Bhamra. The person making the verification call identified themselves as calling from the Canadian High Commission at the end of the phone call, and the respondent did not change his answers at that time. The respondent was also able to identify the other employees of the shop while confirming Mr Bhamra was not among them. I am satisfied that the person spoken to during the verification call was Mr Jit Singh, owner for Panesar Timber Store, and that Mr. Bhamra is not, and has not ever been, an employee of Panesar Timber Store. I am not satisfied that the statement provided by Mr Jit Singh on 30 August 2012 that he never received our call is credible given the information provided in the phone verification. The further documents submitted by the applicant do not overcome the concerns raised by the telephone verification. In my opinion, on a balance of probabilities, the applicant misrepresented that he has work experience as a Carpenter by submitting an inauthentic experience certificate in support of this fact ... I therefore recommend that the applicant be made inadmissible to Canada under section 40 of the Act ...
[12]
On 16 October 2012, the date of the Decision, another user identified as "CMO2803," who is presumably the Officer, made the following GCMS entry:
Misrepresentation assessment: I have reviewed the documentation and information relating to Mr. Varinder Singh Bhamra's employment which have been submitted as part of his application for permanent residence in Canada under the Saskatchewan provincial nominee program. Due to concerns about the genuineness of the applicant's stated employment experience, a telephone investigation was undertaken by this office on 1 August 2011. During the course of this verification, significant discrepancies related to the employment history of Mr. Bhamra were identified and these have been set out in the case notes. A procedural fairness letter dated 14 August 2012 was sent to the applicant and a response, with attached documents, was received at the CHC on 6 SEP 2012. All information relating to Mr. Bhamra's employment, was reviewed in rendering this decision. In my opinion, on a balance of probabilities, the applicant misrepresented his employment history by submitting inauthentic documents and information relating to his stated employment as a carpenter at Panesar Timer [sic] Store in Jagraon. Following a review of the information, I find it reasonable to conclude that Mr. Bhamra does not have the experience claimed in his application. This information provided in support of this application is material and could have led to an error in the administration of the Act ... I am therefore, of the opinion that the applicant is inadmissible to Canada under section 40 of the Act. This application is refused.
[13]
The Applicant argues that the following entry of 5 March 2011, created by a user identified as "LB00260," is also relevant to these proceedings:
... Pls confirme [sic] Applicant's [experience] at Panesar Timber Store - working as a carpenter. Seems strange that the experience letter would have a colour photo of applicant in letterhead??...
ISSUES
[14]
The Applicant raises the following issues in this proceeding:
• Was the Officer's finding that he is inadmissible to Canada under subsection 40(1)(a) of the Act unreasonable?
• Did the Officer breach a duty of procedural fairness in coming to this conclusion?
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[15]
The Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is settled in a satisfactory manner by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless, or where the relevant precedents appear to be inconsistent with new developments in the common law principles of judicial review, must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[16]
The parties agree, and the Court concurs, that the standard of review for the first issue is reasonableness (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47), and the standard of review with respect to the second issue, which raises a question of procedural fairness, is correctness (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[17]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47, and Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."

ARGUMENT
Applicant
Reasonableness of the Decision
[19]
The Applicant argues that the Officer acted unreasonably and single-mindedly in finding that the Applicant had misrepresented himself, relying exclusively on the telephone call to the Applicant's purported employer and failing to address the other available evidence. He notes that the Officer reached this conclusion despite a provincial nominee program [PNP] official being satisfied as to the veracity of the Applicant's employment history, and despite being provided with a sworn letter of employment from the Applicant's employer and another sworn statement of the employer in response to the procedural fairness letter. The Applicant says that the Officer failed to consider this evidence and failed to provide adequate reasons for doubting its veracity:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[20]
The Applicant says the information from the telephone call was contrary to all of the other evidence, and the Officer failed to provide any comment as to why the additional evidence was not sufficient to overcome his or her credibility concerns. He argues that the Officer's preference for the telephone call evidence is especially problematic given that the Officer did not personally make the call, and states that it cannot be ascertained whether the full transcript of the conversation is present.
[21]
The Applicant says that the GCMS notes reveal that it was the Applicant's photograph, affixed to the letterhead of the employer's 15 January 2009 letter that mistakenly caused concern about his employment claims. He says no explanation was given for why this was of concern, nor was this concern ever put to the Applicant.
Procedural Fairness
[22]
The Applicant argues that before departing from the decision of the PNP officials, the Officer was required to ascertain why those officials were satisfied as to the Applicant's credibility and fit for the program. The relevant CIC manuals make it clear that there is to be a dialogue between the Immigration Officer and PNP Officials when concerns arise, and the Applicant had a legitimate expectation that such a dialogue would occur. He quotes  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 26 [Baker] for the proposition that "[i]f the claimant has a legitimate expectation that a certain procedure will be followed, this procedure will be required by the duty of fairness ..." While immigration manuals are not binding authorities, they provide instructions to officers as to how they are to carry out their duties, and can give rise to a legitimate expectation regarding the procedures to be followed:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FC) at paras 8-9. He quotes from section 10.4 of Enforcement Manual 2/Overseas Processing Manual 18 (ENF 2/OP 18 Evaluating Inadmissibility), which reads in relevant part [with the Applicant's emphasis included]:
In provincial nominee cases, misrepresentation may be an issue that needs to be addressed by CIC as well as by the province. Where, in examining the application, there is persuasive evidence that the province's selection decision was based on direct or indirect misrepresentation or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration of IRPA, the following should be considered.
It is CIC's responsibility to determine whether applicants are inadmissible. This includes misrepresentation
. Before rendering an inadmissibility decision pursuant to A40, the officer must examine issues of relevancy and materiality.
As this may be related to the selection decision made by the province, the visa officer should consult with the provincial official to gather all the information necessary regarding materiality and relevancy. This consultation process and the evidence gathered from the province should be clearly explained and recorded in the file notes for possible use as evidence in the Federal Court or before the IRB
.
The procedure outlined below should be followed in cases involving misrepresentation:
1. As per normal standards of procedural fairness, the visa officer should advise the applicant of the concerns and give the applicant at least 30 days to respond to the concerns. The province should receive a copy of this letter, and the applicant should be advised that the province is being provided with the copy.
2.
If the reply from the applicant provides a satisfactory explanation
to meet the visa officer's concerns,
case processing may continue normally without referral to the province
.
3. If
there is no reply, or if the reply does not provide a satisfactory explanation to meet the concerns of misrepresentation in line with normal procedural fairness standards
, the visa officer should proceed as follows:
• Consult with the responsible provincial authority, asking the province to confirm the concerns regarding misrepresentation and request that they withdraw the provincial nomination certificate
• The visa office must
a) provide the province with documentation from the file regarding their concerns;
b) advise the province that the applicant had been provided with an opportunity to respond and the nature of that response; and
c) inform them of the visa officer's conclusion that misrepresentation of a material fact relating to a relevant matter has occurred.[...]
[23]
The Applicant argues that these statements in the ENF 2 / OP 18 manual show that he had a legitimate expectation that PNP officials in Saskatchewan would be consulted before his application for permanent residence was refused by CIC, and that there is no evidence that such a consultation took place. Without it, he says, CIC had no way of knowing whether PNP officials contacted the Applicant's employer, Jit Singh. The PNP officials were clearly convinced of the authenticity of the Applicant's past employment, and the Officer ought to have inquired as to the reasons for this before reaching an opposite conclusion. The Officer's failure to follow through on the procedure set out in the manual was contrary to the Applicant's legitimate expectation and a breach of natural justice:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[24]
Furthermore, the Officer's preference of the verification call evidence over the employer's sworn statements shows that the Officer doubted the credibility of both the Applicant and his employer, the Applicant argues, and procedural fairness required that the Officer make follow-up inquiries or grant the Applicant an in-person interview before making a decision on that basis. He says he was placed in an untenable position: he was asked to provide a response to the Officer's allegations, but any denial of the telephone conversation was deemed to lack credibility. The employer's sworn statement was an appropriate means of responding to the Officer's credibility concerns:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [Lu]. Beyond this statement, and without the benefit of an in-person interview, the Applicant is left wondering what more he could have done to satisfy the Officer.
[25]
The Applicant argues that the Court's reasoning in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  applies to this case. In that case, a visa office called an employer to verify Ms. Guo's employment history, was provided with information that contradicted her application, and sent a procedural fairness letter. Ms. Guo's response included a letter from the employer explaining that the information provided over the phone was incorrect, but this was characterized by the visa office as a "retraction" of the telephone conversation and found not to be credible. Justice Harrington found that the visa office should have made further inquiries and was not justified in preferring the evidence from the telephone call ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 14-15):
[14] ... In this case, the error rested with [the employer's representative]. Ms. Guo acted sensibly and approached him immediately. The doubts the Ministry had should have been dealt with by follow-up queries ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 1990).
[15] Of course, it may be that Ms. Guo is lying, and that the information provided by Mr. Wang in his telephone call was true. However, there was simply no evidentiary record to allow the immigration officers to disbelieve her. Consequently, the application for judicial review shall be granted. There is no serious question of general importance to certify.
[26]
In the present case, the Applicant argues that he did all he could to satisfy the Officer that the telephone call was unreliable, and the Officer failed to explain why the sworn statements were not reliable. When confronted with a sworn statement that was directly contrary to the notes from the verification call, the Officer was required as a matter of fairness to go beyond explaining why those notes were to be preferred. The sworn statement should have raised a doubt in the mind of the Officer, and those doubts "should have been dealt with by follow-up queries" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 5, 7-8, 14). The duty of fairness could have been satisfied by making a second phone call to the employer or by inviting the Applicant for an interview (see Baker, above, at paras 22, 24, 28), but neither of these things occurred.
[27]
Greater procedural protections were required in this case both because of the serious consequences to the Applicant, who is excluded from seeking entry to Canada for two years, and also because economic class applications are made largely on objective criteria:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 2000 CanLII 17143 (FCA) at para 31. While an oral hearing is not always necessary, the Applicant was owed the opportunity to meaningfully respond to concerns and have his responses fully and fairly considered:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Respondent
[28]
The Respondent says that the Applicant's application for permanent residence was dismissed because he misrepresented his work experience. The Decision was reasonable, and the process leading up to it was fair.
[29]
Contrary to the Applicant's assertions, the record shows that the Officer considered both the Applicant's acceptance through the PNP and the fact that his alleged boss, Jit Singh, provided sworn statements verifying his employment, the Respondent argues. The Applicant simply disagrees with the assignment of greater weight to the verification phone call.
[30]
Furthermore, the notion that it is problematic that the verification call was not made by the same officer who made the decision is without merit, as the Applicant fails to cite any authority or provide any explanation for why this is problematic or unfair.
[31]
The Respondent also rejects the argument that it is unclear why the evidence from the verification phone call was preferred over the sworn statements of the purported employer. The GCMS notes state several reasons for this preference:
(a) The verification phone call was made to the same phone number listed on the Company's letterhead;
(b) The person who conducted the verification call confirmed with the responding party at the beginning of the call that they were Singh;
(c) There was no reason or incentive for the responding party to identify himself as Singh, if he in fact was not;
(d) The responding party denied on several occasions during the call that he knew the Applicant, or that the Applicant had worked for him;
(e) The responding party confirmed twice that the company only makes doors and door frames;
(f) The responding party named his three employees and the Applicant was not one of them. Two of these employees were also mentioned as employees in the written statement provided in response to CIC's fairness letter; and
(g) The responding party was only told at the end of the call that he was talking to the Canadian High Commission.
[32]
The Respondent argues that there was no obligation on the Officer to conduct an interview with the Applicant to assess his credibility. Fairness required that the Applicant be advised of the Officer's concerns through the procedural fairness letter following the verification call, but the Officer was not required to blindly accept the Applicant's response to the fairness letter. Rather, the Officer was required to assess whether the response satisfied and alleviated his or her concerns, and that assessment is to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [Ni].
[33]
The Respondent says that Lu, above, does not assist the Applicant, as Justice Zinn's comments in that case regarding the sworn affidavit that could have addressed the officer's credibility concerns were made in obiter after dismissing the application. The comments were case specific and directed to the parties involved.
[34]
The Respondent argues that  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , is also distinguishable. In that case, the visa office had no evidentiary basis to disbelieve the Applicant's response to the fairness letter, whereas in the present case, the Officer clearly set out why he or she preferred the verification phone call and what specific evidence was relied upon in dismissing the application:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 15; Ni, above, at para 18.
[35]
The Respondent says the argument that CIC was required to find out from Saskatchewan authorities why he was nominated for their PNP before dismissing his application has already been rejected by this  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [Hui], another PNP nominee had his application for permanent residence dismissed due to misrepresentation of his work experience, and argued that CIC erred by dismissing his application before consulting with officials from Saskatchewan. Justice Barnes addressed this argument as follows:
[12] Mr. Hui also contends that the Visa Officer breached the duty of fairness by failing to consult with officials from Saskatchewan before his claim was rejected. This argument has no merit. Article 4.10 of the Canada-Saskatchewan Immigration Agreement requires Canada to notify Saskatchewan of the reasons for a possible refusal of a provincial nominee. Here that was done when Canada copied Saskatchewan with the Visa Officer's fairness letter and Saskatchewan declined to intervene. Canada met its contractual obligations and no further duty was owed to Mr. Hui.
[36]
In the present case, the Respondent says, Saskatchewan authorities were emailed a copy of the procedural fairness letter two days after it was sent to the Applicant.
ANALYSIS
[37]
I can find no reviewable error in this Decision.
[38]
First of all, the Decision is not unreasonable. The record shows that the Officer considered the fact that the Applicant had been accepted as a member of the Saskatchewan PNP and that letters from Mr. Singh purported to verify the Applicant's employment. The Officer simply weighed these facts against the phone call and came to the conclusion, for reasons given, that a misrepresentation had occurred.
[39]
As the Respondent points out, the GCMS notes make it clear that the verification phone call outweighed all other facts, and for good reason:
a) The verification phone call was made to the same phone number listed on the Company's letterhead.
b) The person who conducted the verification phone call confirmed with the responding party at the beginning of the phone call that they were Singh.
c) There was no reason or incentive for the responding party to identify himself as Singh, if he in fact was not.
d) The responding party denied on several occasions during the call that he knew the Applicant, or that the Applicant had worked for him.
e) The responding party confirmed twice that the company only makes doors and door frames.
f) The responding party named his three employees and the Applicant was not one of them. Two of these employees were also mentioned as employees in the written statement provided in response to CIC's fairness letter.
g) The responding party was only told at the end of the call that he was talking to the Canadian High Commission.
[40]
Mr. Singh's later suggestion that the verification call "may have been received by a person who did not know Varmider Singh Bharma or was on inimical relations with him and happened to be then present in [Mr. Singh's office] " is fantasy, not evidence. It explains nothing. If such a person exists, there is no explanation as to who he might be and why he might have had access to Mr. Singh's office and his telephone at precisely the time the verification call was made. Without such a fantasy figure, there is simply no explanation as to why Mr. Singh would provide such contradictory information. There is nothing unreasonable about the Officer's conclusions on this point.
[41]
There was considerably more that the Applicant could have done in response to the fairness letter, but he failed to avail himself of the opportunity it gave him. For example, he could have submitted documentation to corroborate his position at the company and letters from other employees. Instead, he left the Officer to choose between the notes on the earlier verification call and Mr. Singh's denial that he received that call.
[42]
Nor was there any procedural unfairness. The Applicant was provided with a fairness letter and given every opportunity to resolve the misrepresentation issue in his own favour. What he offered was contradictory letters and an unbelievable and entirely unsubstantiated reason for the contradiction. As Justice Mandamin pointed out in Chen, above, quoting Justice Zinn in Ni, above, at para 18:
I agree with the applicant that a high degree of fairness is required in misrepresentation determinations. This is why the officer sent the applicant a procedural fairness letter expressly raising his concerns and permitting the applicant to file a response. This is what fairness required in the circumstances and the officer met that burden. It does not require that the officer blindly accept the response to the fairness letter without question. The officer is required to assess whether the response satisfies and alleviates his concerns. That decision is reviewed, as stated, on the reasonableness standard.
It is the fairness letter that, in this context, provides the Applicant with a meaningful opportunity to respond and present his case fully in accordance with Baker principles. The Applicant has not shown me that he could not have presented any response he wished to the fairness letter.
[43]
The Applicant was given his opportunity to explain the contradiction and demonstrate that no misrepresentation had occurred. He was the one with access to the facts. It is not up to CIC to investigate unexplained contradictions. Provided the fairness letter makes clear what the problem is, the onus is upon the Applicant to establish that no misrepresentation has occurred. See Ni, above, at para 18;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In this case, the Applicant did not discharge that onus and presented the Officer with an implausible explanation.
[44]
The Applicant's argument that CIC was required to ascertain from Saskatchewan why he was nominated for the province's PNP before dismissing his application has been addressed by this Court. In Hui, above, at para 12, Justice Barnes notes:
Mr. Hui also contends that the Visa Officer breached the duty of fairness by failing to consult with officials from Saskatchewan before his claim was rejected. This argument has no merit. Article 4.10 of the Canada-Saskatchewan Immigration Agreement requires Canada to notify Saskatchewan of the reasons for a possible refusal of a provincial nominee. Here that was done when Canada copied Saskatchewan with the Visa Officer's fairness letter and Saskatchewan declined to intervene. Canada met its contractual obligations and no further duty was owed to Mr. Hui.
[45]
In the present case, the record shows that a copy of the procedural fairness letter was sent to Saskatchewan officials 2 days after it was sent to the Applicant and before the final decision was made. In addition, the Applicant has not demonstrated how anything that transpired between CIC and Saskatchewan, or that did not transpire, prevented him from providing a full response to the fairness letter.
[46]
The Applicant's reliance on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , is misplaced. In Guo, Justice Harrington found that "there was no evidentiary record to allow the immigration officers to disbelieve her . . ." (para 15). That is not the case here. Ms. Guo provided a plausible explanation and significant details for the discrepancy in that case that warranted further investigation. The Applicant did not provide anything that warranted further investigation and he has failed to place before me any suggestion of what further investigation could have revealed that would be of assistance to him.
[47]
The basis for the Officer's concerns about misrepresentation was made very clear in the fairness letter. All the Applicant did was provide a contradictory follow-up from Mr. Singh with no plausible explanation for the contradiction. He has still provided no plausible explanation to the Court. There is nothing before me to suggest that procedural unfairness occurred in this case.
[48]
The parties agree that there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[49]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
:
1. the application is dismissed; and
2. there is no question for certification.

, LC 2001, c 27 [la Loi] en vue d'obtenir le contrôle judiciaire d'une décision en date du 16 octobre 2012 par laquelle un agent d'immigration désigné [l'agent] a refusé la demande de résidence permanente au Canada présentée par le demandeur au titre de la catégorie de l'immigration économique en tant que candidat désigné par la province au sens du paragraphe 11(1) de la Loi et de l'article 87 du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 [le Règlement]. L'agent a conclu que le demandeur était interdit de territoire pour fausses déclarations au sens de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
).
CONTEXTE
[2]
Âgé de 24 ans, le demandeur est un citoyen de l'Inde qui a présenté une demande en vertu du Programme Candidat immigrant pour la Saskatchewan [PCIS] en février 2009 en tant que menuisier. Sa demande a été acceptée par la province de la Saskatchewan le 11 janvier 2011. Il a ensuite soumis sa demande de résidence permanente par l'intermédiaire du Haut-Commissariat du Canada à New Delhi [l'ambassade] le 21 février 2011. Bien que la province de la Saskatchewan sélectionne des candidats dans le cadre du PCIS, c'est Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada [CIC], qui, par l'intermédiaire d'agents nommément désignés, prend la décision finale quant à leur admission au Canada en décidant notamment s'ils sont interdits ou non de territoire au Canada par application de la Loi.
[3]
À l'appui de sa demande présentée dans le cadre du PCIS, le demandeur a produit une déclaration faite sous serment le 15 janvier 2009 par un employeur, Jit Singh. Cette déclaration indiquait que le demandeur travaillait pour l'entreprise de M. Singh, Panesar Timber Store, comme menuisier spécialisé dans la fabrication d'armoires depuis le 20 mai 2008 et [traduction] « jusqu'à ce jour ». Le demandeur a également soumis des certificats d'expérience signés par M. Singh avec sa demande de résidence permanente dans laquelle il était déclaré qu'il avait travaillé au Panesar Timber Store.
[4]
Le 1er août 2011, un employé de l'ambassade a contacté Jit Singh en vue de vérifier l'emploi et l'expérience du demandeur. Deux des numéros de téléphone fixes indiqués sur le papier à en-tête de Panesar Timber Store n'étaient pas en service, mais l'employé de l'ambassade, qui parlait le pendjabi, a réussi à joindre une personne qui affirmait être Jit Singh en composant un numéro de téléphone portable inscrit sur le même papier à en-tête. M. Singh a déclaré que Panesar Timber Store exploitait une entreprise qui faisait le commerce du bois utilisé pour la fabrication de portes et de dormants de porte et qu'il n'avait jamais exploité une entreprise de fabrication d'armoire ou d'autres meubles. Il a affirmé qu'il ne fabriquait [traduction] « que des portes et des dormants de porte ». M. Singh a également déclaré qu'aucun de ses employés ne portait le nom du demandeur. Après avoir été informé que c'était l'ambassade qui l'appelait, M. Singh a de nouveau affirmé que personne du nom du demandeur n'avait travaillé pour lui. L'employé de l'ambassade a terminé la conversation et inscrit le code TVE-2 (Emploi confirmé frauduleux), dans le dossier du demandeur.
[5]
Le 25 juillet 2012, le demandeur a adressé à l'ambassade une lettre dans laquelle il déclarait qu'il avait changé d'emploi et à laquelle il a joint une lettre de son nouvel employeur, Devgan Wood Works, qui affirmait également qu'il travaillait comme menuisier.
[6]
Le 14 août 2012, un agent des visas de l'ambassade a fait parvenir au demandeur une « lettre d'équité procédurale » informant ce dernier de la teneur de la conversation téléphonique avec M. Singh et déclarant qu'il était par conséquent raisonnable de croire que le demandeur avait soumis de fausses lettres au sujet de son expérience de travail. L'agent des visas a mentionné les dispositions de la Loi relatives à l'interdiction de territoire pour fausses déclarations et a accordé au demandeur 30 jours pour dissiper par écrit les doutes soulevés, après quoi une décision serait prise. La lettre expliquait par ailleurs que le changement récent d'employeurs du demandeur [traduction] « n'est pas pertinent » étant donné qu'il avait été désigné par la province de la Saskatchewan en fonction de l'expérience qu'il avait acquise au Panesar Timber Store, à l'égard de laquelle de fausses déclarations auraient été faites.
[7]
Le demandeur a répondu le 1er septembre 2012 par une lettre dans laquelle il déclarait que les renseignements contenus dans la lettre d'équité procédurale étaient inexacts. Il a joint une autre déclaration notariée faite sous serment par Jit Singh le 30 août 2012. Dans cette lettre, ce dernier niait catégoriquement les faits allégués dans la lettre d'équité procédurale, réaffirmait que le demandeur avait travaillé pour Panesar Timber Store du 15 juin 2007 au 15 décembre 2007 puis, de nouveau, du 20 mai 2008 au 3 février 2012 et affirmait que dans le cadre de ce travail il avait [traduction] « fabriqué des dormants de porte et de fenêtre, des armoires de cuisine et des placards de chambre, pour être précis, et effectué divers travaux de menuiserie dans des appartements résidentiels ». M. Singh écrivait qu'il ne se souvenait pas d'avoir reçu un appel téléphonique de l'ambassade et présumait que l'appel [traduction] « avait peut-être été reçu par une personne qui ne connaissait pas Varinder Singh Bhamra ou qui n'était pas en bons termes avec lui et qui se trouvait par hasard dans le bureau de [M. Singh] ».
[8]
Le 16 décembre 2012, une lettre a été adressée au demandeur pour l'informer qu'il avait été déclaré interdit de territoire au Canada pour fausses déclarations et que sa demande de résidence permanente était refusée.
DÉCISION À L'EXAMEN
[9]
La décision est constituée de la lettre du 16 décembre 2012 et des notes versées au dossier du demandeur dans le Système mondial de gestion des cas [les notes versées au SMGC].
[10]
La lettre expliquait que, en vertu de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la Loi, faire, directement ou indirectement, une présentation erronée sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou une réticence sur ce fait, entraînant ou risquant d'entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la Loi, emporte interdiction de territoire pour fausses déclarations, et que le paragraphe 40(2) dispose que l'interdiction de territoire vaut pour deux ans. Il était indiqué dans la lettre qu'après avoir examiné l'ensemble des renseignements soumis et recueillis, y compris la réponse donnée par le demandeur à la lettre du 14 août 2012 de l'ambassade, l'agent avait conclu que le demandeur avait fait une présentation erronée sur un fait important concernant son expérience de travail. Les documents complémentaires qui avaient été soumis n'avaient pas réussi à dissiper les doutes soulevés à la suite de la vérification téléphonique, étant donné que l'agent n'était [traduction] « pas convaincu que la personne avec laquelle le représentant de notre bureau a parlé au cours de la vérification téléphonique n'était pas M. Jit Singh, propriétaire de Panesar Timber Store ». L'agent a conclu que le demandeur avait fait une présentation erronée sur un fait important qui risquait d'entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la Loi, étant donné qu'un agent aurait pu être amené à croire que l'expérience de travail déclarée par le demandeur était authentique et que le demandeur satisfaisait aux exigences prévues pour être désigné candidat par la province. La lettre expliquait qu'en raison de ce constat de fausses déclarations, le demandeur était interdit de territoire du Canada pour une période de deux ans à compter de la date de la lettre.
[11]
Les notes versées au SMGC renferment d'autres renseignements au sujet du traitement du dossier du demandeur. Voici un extrait des notes du 21 septembre 2012 d'un utilisateur qui s'est identifié par son numéro de matricule, « ACO1326 », au sujet de l'examen de la réponse donnée par le demandeur à la lettre d'équité procédurale:
[traduction] [...] M. Bhamra a produit une déclaration du propriétaire de Panesar Timber Store, M. Jit Singh, déclarant qu'il travaillait pour son entreprise. M. Singh nie dans cette déclaration avoir jamais reçu d'appels téléphoniques de nos bureaux. L'appel de vérification a été fait au même numéro de téléphone que celui qui figure tant sur le papier à en-tête du certificat d'expérience que sur la nouvelle déclaration de l'employeur [...] La personne qui a procédé à l'appel de vérification a confirmé que la personne qui lui a répondu au début de l'appel était bien Jit Singh, propriétaire de Panesar Timber Store. La personne qui a répondu à l'appel téléphonique n'avait aucune raison de s'identifier comme Jit Singh si effectivement il ne s'agissait pas de lui. La personne qui a répondu à l'appel téléphonique a nié à plusieurs reprises au cours de cet appel connaître ou avoir déjà employé Varinder Singh Bhamra. Elle a également confirmé à deux reprises que son entreprise ne fabriquait que des portes et des dormants de porte. De plus, la personne qui a répondu à l'appel téléphonique a bel et bien identifié les trois employés de M. Jit Singh, et le demandeur n'en faisait pas partie. Le nom de deux des employés dont la personne qui a répondu à l'appel téléphonique a fait mention figure également à ce titre dans la déclaration écrite plus récente. À la fin de l'appel, on a informé la personne qui a répondu à l'appel téléphonique que l'appel provenait du Haut-Commissariat du Canada et on lui a demandé une dernière fois de confirmer que Varinder Singh Bhamra travaillait ou avait déjà travaillé pour M. Jit Singh, ce à quoi l'interlocuteur a de nouveau répondu que cette personne n'avait jamais travaillé pour M. Singh. Lors de l'appel de vérification, la personne qui a répondu à l'appel téléphonique n'a donné aucun indice permettant de penser qu'elle n'était pas en mesure de fournir des renseignements fiables sur les faits en question. Cette personne n'avait aucune raison de se faire passer pour M. Jit Singh, le propriétaire de Panesar Timber Store, ou de donner à nos bureaux des renseignements incorrects au sujet de M. Bhamra. L'auteur de l'appel de vérification s'est identifié comme employé du Haut-Commissariat du Canada à la fin de l'appel téléphonique et la personne qui a répondu à l'appel téléphonique n'a pas changé ses réponses à ce moment-là. Cette dernière personne a également été en mesure d'identifier les autres employés de l'usine tout en confirmant que M. Bhamra n'en faisait pas partie. Je suis convaincu que la personne à qui l'on a parlé au cours de l'appel de vérification était bel et bien M. Jit Singh, propriétaire de Panesar Timber Store, et que M. Bhamra n'est pas et n'a jamais été un employé de Panesar Timber Store. Je ne trouve pas crédible l'affirmation de M. Jit Singh du 30 août 2012 suivant laquelle il n'a jamais reçu notre appel téléphonique, compte tenu des renseignements obtenus au cours de la vérification téléphonique. Les documents complémentaires soumis par le demandeur n'ont pas permis de répondre aux préoccupations soulevées lors de la vérification téléphonique. À mon avis, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le demandeur a fait de fausses déclarations au sujet de l'expérience de travail qu'il avait acquise comme menuisier en soumettant un certificat d'expérience qui n'était pas authentique à l'appui de ses dires [...] Je recommande par conséquent que le demandeur soit interdit de territoire au Canada par application de l'article 40 de la Loi [...]
[12]
Le 16 octobre 2012, date de la décision, un autre fonctionnaire identifié sous le matricule « CMO2803 », et qui est vraisemblablement l'agent, a noté ce qui suit dans le SMGC:
[traduction] Évaluation des fausses déclarations: J'ai examiné les documents et les renseignements relatifs à l'emploi de M. Varinder Singh Bhamra que ce dernier a soumis à l'appui de sa demande de résidence permanente au Canada dans le cadre du programme des candidats provinciaux. En raison des préoccupations soulevées au sujet de l'authenticité de l'expérience de travail déclarée par le demandeur, une enquête téléphonique a été menée par nos bureaux le 1er août 2011. Au cours de cette vérification, d'importantes divergences concernant les antécédents professionnels de M. Bhamra ont été signalées et ont été consignées dans son dossier. Une lettre d'équité procédurale a été adressée le 14 août 2012 à M. Bhamra et une réponse, à laquelle étaient joints des documents, a été reçue au Haut-Commissariat du Canada le 6 septembre 2012. Tous les renseignements relatifs à l'emploi de M. Bhamra ont été examinés avant de rendre la présente décision. À mon avis, suivant la prépondérance des probabilités, le demandeur a fait de fausses déclarations au sujet de ses antécédents professionnels en soumettant des documents et des renseignements non authentiques en ce qui concerne l'emploi qu'il dit avoir occupé comme menuisier au Panesar Timber Store à Jagraon. Après avoir examiné les renseignements en question, j'estime raisonnable de conclure que M. Bhamra ne possède pas l'expérience qu'il prétend posséder dans sa demande. Les renseignements fournis à l'appui de la présente demande sont importants et auraient pu entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la Loi [...] Je suis par conséquent d'avis que le demandeur doit être déclaré interdit de territoire au Canada en application de l'article 40 de la Loi. La demande est rejetée.
[13]
Le demandeur affirme que les notes suivantes prises le 5 mars 2011 par un fonctionnaire portant le matricule LB00260 sont également importantes dans le cas qui nous occupe:
[traduction] Veuillez confirmer l'expérience du demandeur comme menuisier chez Panesar Timber Store. Il semble étrange qu'on ait collé sur le papier à en-tête de la lettre relative à son expérience de travail une photo couleur du demandeur?? [...]
QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[14]
Le demandeur soulève les questions suivantes:
• L'interdiction de territoire constatée par l'agent en application de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la Loi était-elle déraisonnable?
• L'agent a-t-il manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale en concluant à l'interdiction de territoire?
NORME DE CONTRÔLE
[15]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada a déclaré qu'il n'est pas toujours nécessaire de se livrer à une analyse de la norme de contrôle. Lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable à la question que la Cour doit examiner est déjà bien établie par la jurisprudence, le tribunal saisi du contrôle judiciaire peut adopter cette norme de contrôle. Ce n'est que lorsque cette démarche se révèle infructueuse ou que la jurisprudence semble devenue incompatible avec l'évolution récente du droit en matière de contrôle judiciaire que le tribunal procédera à l'examen des quatre facteurs de l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[16]
Les parties conviennent - et la Cour est du même avis - que la norme de contrôle applicable dans le cas de la première question est celle de la décision raisonnable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47), et que la norme de contrôle applicable dans le cas de la seconde question, qui soulève une question d'équité procédurale, est celle de la décision correcte (
Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[17]
Lorsque la Cour effectue le contrôle d'une décision selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, son analyse tient « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (Dunsmuir, précité, au paragraphe 47, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Autrement dit, la Cour ne devrait intervenir que si la décision est déraisonnable en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».
DISPOSITIONS LÉGISLATIVES APPLICABLES
[18]
Les dispositions suivantes de la Loi s'appliquent en l'espèce:
Fausses déclarations
40. (1) Emportent interdiction de territoire pour fausses déclarations les faits suivants:

[...]
Application
(2) Les dispositions suivantes s'appliquent au paragraphe (1):
a) l'interdiction de territoire court pour les deux ans suivant la décision la constatant en dernier ressort, si le résident permanent ou l'étranger n'est pas au pays, ou suivant l'exécution de la mesure de renvoi;

[...]
PRÉTENTIONS ET MOYENS DES PARTIES
Le demandeur
Caractère raisonnable de la décision
[19]
Le demandeur affirme que l'agent a agi de façon déraisonnable et a fait preuve d'étroitesse d'esprit en concluant que le demandeur avait fait de fausses déclarations à son sujet en se fondant exclusivement sur la conversation téléphonique avec son présumé employeur et sans tenir compte des autres éléments de preuve dont il disposait. Le demandeur souligne que l'agent a tiré cette conclusion malgré le fait qu'un fonctionnaire du Programme des candidats des provinces s'était dit convaincu de l'authenticité des antécédents professionnels du demandeur et malgré le fait que l'agent avait en mains une lettre d'emploi faite sous serment provenant d'un employeur du demandeur ainsi qu'une autre déclaration faite sous serment par l'employeur en réponse à la lettre d'équité procédurale. Le demandeur affirme que l'agent n'a pas tenu compte de ces éléments de preuve et qu'il n'a pas suffisamment expliqué les raisons pour lesquelles il mettait en doute leur authenticité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[20]
Le demandeur affirme que les renseignements obtenus lors de la conversation téléphonique contredisaient tous les autres éléments de preuve et que l'agent n'a pas expliqué pourquoi les éléments de preuve complémentaires n'étaient pas suffisants pour dissiper ses doutes au sujet de la crédibilité. Il affirme que, étant donné que l'agent n'a pas personnellement participé à cette conversation téléphonique, le fait qu'il ait préféré les éléments de preuve recueillis lors de celle-ci est particulièrement problématique. Le demandeur ajoute qu'on ne peut savoir s'il existe une transcription intégrale de cette conversation téléphonique.
[21]
Le demandeur affirme que les notes versées au SMGC révèlent que c'est la photographie du demandeur qui a été fixée au papier à en-tête de la lettre de l'employeur du 15 janvier 2009 qui a soulevé, à tort, des doutes au sujet de ses affirmations quant à son emploi. Le demandeur ajoute qu'aucune raison n'a été donnée pour expliquer pourquoi cette photo avait pu soulever des doutes, qui ne lui ont d'ailleurs jamais été signalés.
Équité procédurale
[22]
Le demandeur affirme qu'avant d'écarter la décision des fonctionnaires du PCP, l'agent avait l'obligation de vérifier la raison pour laquelle les fonctionnaires en question s'étaient dits convaincus de la crédibilité du demandeur et de son admissibilité au programme. Les guides pertinents du CIC précisent dans les termes les plus nets qu'un dialogue doit avoir lieu entre l'agent d'immigration et les fonctionnaires du PCP lorsque des doutes sont soulevés, et que le demandeur peut légitimement s'attendre à ce que de tels échanges aient lieu. Il invoque l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 26 [
Baker
] à l'appui de la proposition que « [s] i le demandeur s'attend légitimement à ce qu'une certaine procédure soit suivie, l'obligation d'équité exigera cette procédure [...] ». Bien que les guides de l'immigration n'aient aucun caractère contraignant, ils fournissent aux agents des directives sur la façon dont ils doivent s'acquitter de leurs fonctions et donnent lieu à une attente légitime en ce qui concerne la procédure à suivre (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF), aux paragraphes 8 et 9). Le demandeur cite la section 10.4 du Guide de traitement des demandes à l'étranger 18/Guide de l'exécution de la Loi (ENF 2/OP 18, Évaluation de l'interdiction d'un territoire) dont voici les extraits qui nous intéressent: [passages soulignés par le demandeur]:
Dans le cas des candidats des provinces, la fausse déclaration est une question qui doit être examinée tant par CIC que par la province. Lors de l'examen de la demande, s'il y a une preuve convaincante de fausse déclaration directe ou indirecte, ou une réticence, sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ce qui entraîne ou risque d'entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la LIPR, il faut tenir compte de ce qui suit.
Il incombe à CIC de déterminer si les demandeurs sont interdits de territoire pour fausses déclarations.
Avant de prendre une décision d'interdiction de territoire en vertu de L40, l'agent doit examiner les questions de pertinence et d'importance.
Comme ces questions pourraient être liées à la décision de sélection prise par la province, l'agent des visas doit consulter le représentant de la province afin de recueillir tous les renseignements nécessaires concernant la pertinence et l'importance. Ce processus de consultation ainsi que les preuves fournies par la province doivent être clairement expliqués et consignés au dossier au cas où cela pourrait servir de preuve aux audiences de la Cour fédérale ou de la CISR, le cas échéant.
La procédure décrite ci-dessous doit être suivie dans les cas comportant des fausses déclarations:
1. Conformément aux normes habituelles de l'équité procédurale, l'agent des visas doit aviser le demandeur de ses doutes et lui donner au moins 30 jours pour y répondre. La province doit recevoir copie de la lettre au demandeur et ce dernier doit en être avisé.
2.
Si le demandeur fournit une réponse qui dissipe les doutes de l'agent des visas, le traitement de la demande peut se poursuivre normalement, sans que la province ait à s'en occuper.
3.
S'il n'y a pas de réponse ou si la réponse ne fournit pas une explication qui réussit à dissiper les doutes au sujet de la fausse déclaration, conformément aux normes habituelles de l'équité procédurale
, l'agent des visas doit procéder de la façon suivante:
• Consulter l'autorité provinciale responsable afin que la province confirme les doutes au sujet de fausses déclarations et retire son certificat de désignation des provinces;
• Le bureau des visas doit
a) fournir à la province la documentation liée aux doutes qui se trouve au dossier;
b) aviser la province que le demandeur a eu l'occasion de répondre et l'informer de la nature de la réponse; et
c) l'informer de la conclusion de l'agent des visas selon laquelle il y a eu fausse déclaration sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent [...]
[23]
Le demandeur soutient que ces extraits du guide ENF 2/OP 18 démontrent qu'il pouvait raisonnablement s'attendre à ce que les fonctionnaires du PCP de la Saskatchewan soient consultés avant que CIC refuse sa demande de résidence permanente, ajoutant que rien ne permet de penser que de telles consultations ont effectivement eu lieu. Sans ces consultations, CIC n'avait, à son avis, aucune façon de savoir si les fonctionnaires chargés de l'application du PCP avaient communiqué avec son employeur, Jit Singh. Les fonctionnaires du PCP étaient de toute évidence convaincus de l'authenticité des antécédents professionnels du demandeur et l'agent aurait dû se renseigner sur les raisons de cette conviction avant de tirer la conclusion contraire. Le défaut de l'agent de respecter la procédure prévue dans le guide allait à l'encontre des attentes légitimes du demandeur et constituait un manquement aux principes de justice naturelle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 22).
[24]
De plus, le demandeur soutient que le fait que l'agent ait préféré les éléments de preuve recueillis lors de l'appel téléphonique de vérification aux déclarations faites sous serment par l'employeur démontre que l'agent doutait de la crédibilité tant du demandeur que de son employeur, et l'équité procédurale exigeait que l'agent cherche à obtenir des renseignements complémentaires ou reçoive le demandeur en entrevue avant de rendre sa décision sur ce fondement. Le demandeur affirme qu'il a été placé dans une situation intenable: on lui a demandé de répondre aux allégations de l'agent, mais toute dénégation concernant la conversation téléphonique était réputée manquer de crédibilité. Le fait de fournir une déclaration écrite de son employeur constituait un moyen approprié pour dissiper les doutes soulevés par l'agent au sujet de sa crédibilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Lu
]). Le demandeur se demande ce qu'il aurait pu faire de plus pour convaincre l'agent après avoir fourni cette déclaration et sans bénéficier d'une entrevue personnelle.
[25]
Le demandeur affirme que le raisonnement suivi par la Cour dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], s'applique au cas qui nous occupe. Dans cette affaire, un agent des visas avait appelé un employeur pour vérifier les antécédents professionnels de Mme Guo, avait recueilli des renseignements qui contredisaient la demande présentée par Mme Guo, et avait envoyé une lettre d'équité procédurale à cette dernière. En réponse, Mme Guo avait fourni une lettre dans laquelle son employeur expliquait que les renseignements fournis au téléphone étaient inexacts, mais le bureau des visas avait qualifié cette lettre de « rétractation » de la conversation téléphonique et ne l'avait pas jugée crédible. Le juge Harrington a conclu que le bureau des visas aurait dû faire d'autres vérifications et qu'il n'était pas justifié de retenir uniquement les éléments de preuve recueillis lors de la conversation téléphonique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, aux paragraphes 14 et 15):
[14] [...] En l'espèce, l'erreur a été commise par [le représentant de l'employeur]. Mme Guo a réagi avec bon sens et a immédiatement communiqué avec lui. Les doutes qu'entretenaient les fonctionnaires du ministère auraient dû les inciter à faire un suivi (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] A.C.F. no 1990).
[15] Bien entendu, il est possible que Mme Guo ne dise pas la vérité et que les renseignements qu'avait fournis M. Wang par téléphone soient véridiques. Il n'existe toutefois aucun élément de preuve qui permettait aux agents d'immigration de ne pas la croire. Par conséquent, il sera fait droit à la demande de contrôle judiciaire. Il n'y a pas de question grave de portée générale à certifier.
[26]
Dans le cas qui nous occupe, le demandeur affirme qu'il a fait tout en son possible pour convaincre l'agent que l'appel téléphonique n'était pas fiable. Il ajoute que l'agent n'a pas expliqué pourquoi les déclarations faites sous serment n'étaient pas fiables. Confronté à une déclaration sous serment qui contredisait directement les notes prises lors de l'appel de vérification, l'agent se devait, par souci d'équité, de faire plus que d'expliquer pourquoi les notes en question devaient être retenues. La déclaration sous serment aurait dû soulever des doutes dans l'esprit de l'agent et ces doutes « auraient dû [l] 'inciter à faire un suivi » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, aux paragraphes 5, 7, 8 et 14). L'agent aurait pu satisfaire à son obligation d'agir avec équité en faisant un second appel téléphonique à l'employeur ou en convoquant le demandeur à une entrevue (
Baker
, précité, aux paragraphes 22, 24 et 28), mais il n'en a rien fait.
[27]
La présente affaire commandait des mesures de protection procédurale accrues tant en raison des graves conséquences auxquelles est exposé le demandeur, qui doit attendre deux ans avant de pouvoir demander l'admission au Canada, qu'en raison du fait que les demandes présentées dans la catégorie « immigration économique » sont jugées en grande partie en fonction de critères objectifs (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 2000 CanLII 17143 (CAF), au paragraphe 31). Bien qu'une audience ne soit pas toujours nécessaire, l'agent devait offrir au demandeur une réelle possibilité de dissiper ses doutes et procéder à un examen exhaustif et équitable de ses réponses (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Le défendeur
[28]
Le défendeur affirme que la demande de résidence permanente du demandeur a été rejetée parce qu'il a fait de fausses déclarations au sujet de ses antécédents professionnels. La décision était raisonnable et la démarche suivie pour y parvenir était équitable.
[29]
Le défendeur soutient que, contrairement à ce que le demandeur prétend, le dossier démontre que l'agent a tenu compte tant du fait que le demandeur avait été déclaré admissible dans le cadre du PCP que du fait que son présumé patron, Jit Singh, avait fourni des déclarations faites sous serment pour confirmer ses antécédents professionnels. Le demandeur est tout simplement en désaccord avec le fait que l'agent a accordé plus de poids aux vérifications faites par téléphone.
[30]
Le défendeur estime qu'on ne saurait retenir l'argument selon lequel il est problématique que les vérifications téléphoniques n'aient pas été faites par l'agent qui a rendu la décision étant donné que le demandeur n'a fait référence à aucun précédent et n'a donné aucune raison pour expliquer en quoi cette façon de procéder posait problème ou était injuste.
[31]
Le défendeur conteste également l'argument suivant lequel on ne sait pas avec certitude la raison pour laquelle les éléments de preuve recueillis lors de l'appel téléphonique de vérification ont été préférés aux déclarations faites sous serment par le présumé employeur. Les notes versées au SMGC indiquent plusieurs raisons pour lesquelles ces éléments de preuve ont été retenus:
a) Le numéro de téléphone figurant sur le papier en-tête de l'entreprise a été utilisé pour faire l'appel téléphonique de vérification;
b) La personne qui a procédé à l'appel de vérification a confirmé avec la personne qui lui a répondu, dès le début de l'appel, qu'il s'agissait bien de M. Singh;
c) Rien n'était de nature à inciter la personne qui a répondu à cet appel à se faire passer pour M. Singh, si effectivement il s'agissait d'une autre personne;
d) La personne qui a répondu à l'appel a nié à plusieurs reprises au cours de l'appel qu'il connaissait le demandeur ou que le demandeur avait déjà travaillé pour lui;
e) La personne qui a répondu à l'appel a confirmé à deux reprises que son entreprise ne fabriquait que des portes et des dormants de porte;
f) La personne qui a répondu à l'appel a nommé ses trois employés et le demandeur n'en faisait pas partie. Deux des employés en question étaient également mentionnés comme employés dans la déclaration écrite fournie en réponse à la lettre d'équité de CIC;
g) La personne qui a répondu à l'appel n'a été informée qu'à la fin de la conversation qu'elle parlait à un représentant du Haut-Commissariat du Canada.
[32]
Le défendeur soutient que l'agent n'avait aucune obligation de recevoir le demandeur en entrevue pour apprécier sa crédibilité. L'équité exigeait que l'agent fasse part au demandeur de ses préoccupations au moyen d'une lettre d'équité procédurale envoyée à la suite de l'appel de vérification, mais l'agent n'était pas tenu d'accepter aveuglément les explications que le demandeur lui avait données en réponse à la lettre d'équité. L'agent avait plutôt l'obligation de vérifier si la réponse dissipait ses doutes et cette évaluation est assujettie à la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Ni
]).
[33]
Le défendeur affirme que la décision
Lu
, précitée, n'aide pas le demandeur, étant donné que les observations du juge Zinn dans cette affaire au sujet de l'affidavit qui aurait pu dissiper les doutes de l'agent quant à la crédibilité n'étaient que des remarques incidentes formulées après le rejet de la demande. Ces observations ne valaient que pour cette affaire et ne concernaient que les parties à la procédure.
[34]
Le défendeur affirme que l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, se distingue également de la présente espèce. Dans cette affaire, le bureau des visas ne disposait d'aucun élément de preuve lui permettant de ne pas ajouter foi à la réponse donnée par le demandeur à la lettre d'équité, alors que, dans le cas qui nous occupe, l'agent a expliqué clairement les raisons pour lesquelles il préférait les éléments recueillis lors de l'appel téléphonique de vérification et a précisé sur quels éléments il se fondait pour rejeter la demande ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 15;
Ni
, précitée, au paragraphe 18).
[35]
Le défendeur affirme que l'argument suivant lequel CIC avait l'obligation de vérifier auprès des autorités saskatchewanaises les raisons pour lesquelles le demandeur avait été désigné dans le cadre du PCP avant de rejeter sa demande a par le passé été écarté par notre Cour. Dans le jugement
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Hui
], un autre candidat provincial avait vu sa demande de résidence permanente rejetée pour fausses déclarations sur ses antécédents professionnels. Il soutenait que CIC avait commis une erreur en rejetant sa demande avant de consulter les fonctionnaires de la Saskatchewan. Le juge Barnes a répondu comme suit à cet argument:
[12] M. Hui prétend également que l'agent des visas a manqué à l'obligation d'équité en omettant de consulter les fonctionnaires de la Saskatchewan avant de rejeter sa demande. Cet argument est sans fondement. En vertu de l'article 4.10 de l'Accord Canada-Saskatchewan sur l'immigration, le Canada est tenu d'aviser la Saskatchewan des raisons du refus possible d'un candidat provincial. Cela a été fait en l'espèce lorsque le Canada a envoyé à la Saskatchewan une copie de la lettre d'équité de l'agent des visas et la Saskatchewan a préféré de pas intervenir. Le Canada a respecté ses obligations contractuelles et n'avait aucune autre obligation envers M. Hui.
[36]
Le défendeur affirme que, dans le cas qui nous occupe, les autorités de la Saskatchewan ont reçu par courriel une copie de la lettre d'équité procédurale deux jours après son envoi au demandeur.
ANALYSE
[37]
Je ne décèle dans la décision aucune erreur justifiant l'intervention de la Cour.
[38]
En tout premier lieu, la décision n'est pas déraisonnable. Il ressort du dossier que l'agent a tenu compte du fait que le demandeur avait été accepté comme candidat provincial dans le cadre du PCP de la Saskatchewan et que les lettres écrites par M. Singh étaient censées confirmer les antécédents professionnels du demandeur. L'agent a simplement évalué ces faits en fonction de l'appel téléphonique et il est arrivé à la conclusion, pour les raisons qu'il a exposées, que le demandeur avait fait de fausses déclarations.
[39]
Ainsi que le défendeur le souligne, il ressort à l'évidence des notes versées au SMGC que l'appel téléphonique de vérification l'emportait largement sur tous les autres faits, et ce, pour des raisons valables:
a) Le numéro de téléphone figurant sur le papier en-tête de l'entreprise a été utilisé pour faire l'appel téléphonique de vérification;
b) La personne qui a procédé à l'appel de vérification a confirmé avec la personne qui lui a répondu, dès le début de l'appel, qu'il s'agissait bien de M. Singh;
c) Rien n'était de nature à inciter la personne qui a répondu à cet appel à se faire passer pour M. Singh si effectivement il s'agissait d'une autre personne;
d) La personne qui a répondu à l'appel a nié à plusieurs reprises au cours de l'appel qu'il connaissait le demandeur ou que le demandeur avait déjà travaillé pour lui;
e) La personne qui a répondu à l'appel a confirmé à deux reprises que son entreprise ne fabriquait que des portes et des dormants de porte;
f) La personne qui a répondu à l'appel a nommé ses trois employés et le demandeur n'en faisait pas partie. Deux des employés en question étaient également mentionnés comme employés dans la déclaration écrite fournie en réponse à la lettre d'équité de CIC;
g) La personne qui a répondu à l'appel n'a été informée qu'à la fin de la conversation qu'elle parlait à un représentant du Haut-Commissariat du Canada.
[40]
Le fait que M. Singh a par la suite laissé entendre que l'appel téléphonique de vérification [traduction] « avait peut-être été reçu par une personne qui ne connaissait pas Varinder Singh Bhamra ou qui n'était pas en bons termes avec lui et qui se trouvait par hasard dans le bureau de [M. Singh] » est de la pure fantaisie et n'a aucune valeur de preuve. Cela n'explique rien. Si une telle personne existe, aucune explication n'a été fournie pour préciser son identité et les raisons pour lesquelles elle aurait accès au bureau de M. Singh et à son téléphone précisément au moment où l'appel de vérification a eu lieu. Si l'on fait abstraction de cette explication fantaisiste, on ne dispose tout simplement d'aucune explication quant aux raisons pour lesquelles M. Singh fournirait des renseignements aussi contradictoires. La conclusion tirée par l'agent sur cette question n'est en rien déraisonnable.
[41]
Le demandeur aurait pu déployer plus d'efforts pour répondre à la lettre d'équité et il n'a pas saisi l'occasion qui lui était offerte. Par exemple, il aurait pu soumettre des documents confirmant le poste qu'il occupait au sein de l'entreprise, ainsi que des lettres émanant d'autres employés. Il a plutôt laissé à l'agent le soin de choisir entre les notes prises au sujet de l'appel téléphonique de vérification et l'affirmation de M. Sigh selon laquelle il n'avait jamais reçu cet appel.
[42]
Aucun manquement à l'équité procédurale n'a par ailleurs été commis. Le demandeur a reçu une lettre d'équité et a eu amplement l'occasion de résoudre la question des fausses déclarations en sa faveur. Il a plutôt offert des lettres contradictoires ainsi qu'une explication invraisemblable et entièrement non corroborée au sujet de cette contradiction. Ainsi que le juge Mandamin l'a souligné dans la décision
Chen
, précitée, en s'appuyant sur les remarques du juge Zinn dans la décision
Ni
, précitée, au paragraphe 18:
Je souscris à l'avis du demandeur selon lequel une norme d'équité élevée est requise pour conclure à l'existence de fausses déclarations. C'est la raison pour laquelle l'agent a envoyé au demandeur une lettre d'équité procédurale dans laquelle il a formellement soulevé ses préoccupations et permis au demandeur de présenter une réponse. C'est la norme d'équité requise en les circonstances et l'agent s'est acquitté de son fardeau. Selon la norme d'équité, l'agent n'est pas obligé d'accepter aveuglément la réponse à la lettre d'équité sans se questionner. Il doit évaluer la réponse pour voir si elle répond à ses préoccupations et dissipe ses doutes. Comme nous l'avons vu, cette décision peut être contrôlée selon la norme de la décision raisonnable.
C'est la lettre d'équité qui, dans ce contexte, offre au demandeur une occasion véritable de répondre aux préoccupations et de faire pleinement valoir ses arguments, conformément aux principes énoncés dans l'arrêt
Baker.
Le demandeur ne m'a pas démontré qu'il n'a pas pu présenter la réponse qu'il souhaitait à la lettre d'équité.
[43]
Le demandeur s'est vu offrir la possibilité d'expliquer la contradiction relevée et de démontrer qu'aucune fausse déclaration n'avait été faite. C'est lui qui était au courant des faits. Il ne revient pas au CIC d'entreprendre des démarches pour résoudre les contradictions non expliquées. Dès lors que la lettre d'équité précise bien la nature du problème, c'est au demandeur qu'il incombe de démontrer qu'aucune fausse déclaration n'a été faite (
Ni
, précitée, au paragraphe 18;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 75;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Dans le cas qui nous occupe, le demandeur ne s'est pas acquitté de ce fardeau et il a fourni à l'agent une explication invraisemblable.
[44]
Notre Cour s'est déjà penchée sur l'argument du demandeur suivant lequel CIC avait l'obligation de vérifier auprès des autorités de la Saskatchewan la raison pour laquelle il avait été retenu comme candidat pour le PCP de la province avant de rejeter sa demande. Dans la décision
Hui
, précitée, au paragraphe 12, le juge Barnes fait observer ce qui suit:
M. Hui prétend également que l'agent des visas a manqué à l'obligation d'équité en omettant de consulter les fonctionnaires de la Saskatchewan avant de rejeter sa demande. Cet argument est sans fondement. En vertu de l'article 4.10 de l'Accord Canada-Saskatchewan sur l'immigration, le Canada est tenu d'aviser la Saskatchewan des raisons du refus possible d'un candidat provincial. Cela a été fait en l'espèce lorsque le Canada a envoyé à la Saskatchewan une copie de la lettre d'équité de l'agent des visas et la Saskatchewan a préféré [ne] pas intervenir. Le Canada a respecté ses obligations contractuelles et n'avait aucune autre obligation envers M. Hui.
[45]
Dans le cas qui nous occupe, il ressort du dossier qu'une copie de la lettre d'équité procédurale a été envoyée aux fonctionnaires de la Saskatchewan deux jours après avoir été adressée au demandeur et avant qu'une décision définitive soit prise. De plus, le demandeur n'a pas démontré en quoi les échanges que CIC et la Saskatchewan ont pu avoir ou ne pas avoir l'ont empêché de répondre pleinement à la lettre d'équité.
[46]
Le demandeur invoque à tort la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée. Dans cette décision, le juge Harrington a conclu qu' « il n'existait toutefois aucun élément de preuve qui permettait aux agents d'immigration de ne pas la croire [...] » (au paragraphe 15), ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'espèce. Mme Guo avait donné une explication plausible et fourni des détails importants pour expliquer dans cette affaire des incohérences qui justifiaient une enquête plus approfondie. Le demandeur n'a, en l'espèce, fourni aucun élément qui justifierait une enquête plus approfondie et ne m'a aucunement indiqué ce qu'une enquête plus approfondie aurait pu révéler et en quoi elle lui aurait été utile.
[47]
L'agent a bien expliqué dans la lettre d'équité ses préoccupations quant aux fausses déclarations. Or, le demandeur s'est contenté de produire une lettre de suivi contradictoire de M. Singh sans donner d'explication plausible au sujet de cette contradiction. De même devant la Cour, il n'a pas fourni d'explication plausible. Je n'ai devant moi aucun élément de preuve me permettant de penser qu'un manquement à l'équité procédurale a été commis en l'espèce.
[48]
Les parties sont d'accord pour dire qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier et la Cour est du même avis.
JUGEMENT

LA COUR

1. REJETTE la demande;
2. DÉCLARE qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier.

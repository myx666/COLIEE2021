 I.  
 Nature of the Matter  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] 
   
 Mosley, J. 
 : In this application for judicial review brought under subsection 72(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 [ 
 IRPA 
 ], Mr Chime Tretsetsang challenges the decision of the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD], which allowed the Minister's appeal of a decision rendered by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  For the reasons that follow, this application is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II.  
 Facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Mr Tretsetsang's ethnicity is Tibetan. He was born in India on October 5, 1968. His parents had fled to India when the Chinese government took control of Tibet in 1959.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  Mr Tretsetsang entered Canada with an Indian passport, which he said was fraudulent, on May 3, 2013. He made a refugee claim alleging that he was stateless and that India would deport him to China, where he would be persecuted due to his religion (Buddhism) and political opinion (support for the Dalai Lama and opposition to the Chinese government). He had not applied for Indian citizenship when he lived in India.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  On August 20, 2013, the RPD accepted his refugee claim. The panel acknowledged that the Indian  
 Citizenship Act, 1955 
  provides that a person born in India between January 26, 1950 and July 1, 1987 is an Indian citizen irrespective of the nationality of his or her parents. While he did not have a birth certificate, the applicant was in possession of an Indian travel document known as an identity certificate which stated his place of birth in India during the relevant time period. That certificate, now expired, also bore a stamp that reads "No Objection to Return to India".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The RPD referenced country condition evidence which suggests that Tibetans born within this period can have difficulty in gaining Indian citizenship documents. Relatively few Tibetans have successfully applied for Indian citizenship and they have "experience difficulties" in doing so.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  The RPD concluded, on a balance of probabilities, that the applicant is not a citizen of India and could not be required to return to India as he lacked a secure right to residence in that country. It found that there was a serious possibility that he would be persecuted in China due to his religion and political opinion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The Minister brought an appeal to the RAD. The determinative issue, the RAD explained, was whether it is within the respondent's control to acquire citizenship in India, applying  
 Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ 
 Williams 
 ]. The RAD concluded that it should review the RPD decision on the standard of reasonableness. By decision dated December 11, 2013, the RAD allowed the Minister's appeal and determined that Mr Tretsetsang is not a refugee. In doing so, the RAD rejected his argument that the matter should be returned to the RPD on the question of persecution in India. It concluded that he had not established a well-founded fear of persecution in that country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III.  
 Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  This application raises two issues.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Did the RAD err in concluding that the applicant is a citizen of India?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Did the RAD breach the duty of fairness by dismissing the applicant's claim against India without giving him the opportunity to be heard?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  The first issue is a question of mixed fact and law reviewable on the standard of reasonableness:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  The allegation of procedural unfairness warrants review on the standard of correctness:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 129;

 V.  
 Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 A. Did the RAD err in concluding that the applicant is a citizen of India?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  The parties and I agree that the appropriate test is that set out in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 19-27. In that case, the Federal Court of Appeal affirmed that an individual will not be afforded refugee protection in Canada where his acquisition of citizenship in a safe country is a matter of "mere formalities" or "within the control" of that individual.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The control test was derived by Justice Décary from the reasons for judgment of Justice Rothstein, sitting then as a member of this Court, in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 77:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 In  
 Williams 
 , Justice Décary added at paragraph 22:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The condition of not having a country of nationality must be one that is beyond the power of the applicant to control.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The true test, in my view, is the following: if it is within the control of the applicant to acquire the citizenship of a country with respect to which he has no well-founded fear of persecution, the claim for refugee status will be denied. While words such as "acquisition of citizenship in a non-discretionary manner" or "by mere formalities" have been used, the test is better phrased in terms of "power within the control of the applicant" for it encompasses all sorts of situations, it prevents the introduction of a practice of "country shopping" which is incompatible with the "surrogate" dimension of international refugee protection recognized in  
 Ward 
  and it is not restricted, contrary to what counsel for the respondent has suggested, to mere technicalities such as filing appropriate documents. This "control" test also reflects the notion which is transparent in the definition of a refugee that the "unwillingness" of an applicant to take steps required from him to gain state protection is fatal to his refugee claim unless that unwillingness results from the very fear of persecution itself. Paragraph 106 of the  
 Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status 
  emphasizes the point that whenever "available, national protection takes precedence over international protection," and the Supreme Court of Canada, in  
 Ward 
 , observed, at p. 752, that "[w] hen available, home state protection is a claimant's sole option. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [14] 
  The Court in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , observed at para 23: "Whether the citizenship of another country was obtained  
 at birth 
 , by naturalization or by State succession is of no consequence  
 provided it is within the control of an applicant to obtain it 
 " [emphasis added]. At para 27, the Court wrote that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 where citizenship in another country is  
 available 
 , an applicant is expected to make attempts to acquire it and will be denied refugee status if it is shown that it is within his power to acquire that other citizenship. [Emphasis in original]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  In this matter, there is no indication that the applicant ever made any attempt to acquire Indian citizenship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  The RAD relied on evidence of decisions rendered by the Delhi High Court and Karnataka High Court to find that: (1) Tibetans in the applicant's position are Indian citizens by birth; (2) these decisions bind the Indian government; (3) such persons do not have to apply for citizenship because they are automatically citizens; and (4) the fact that some Tibetans have had difficulty in obtaining passports does not establish that citizenship is not within their control.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  The applicant contends that none of these conclusions are defensible in light of the evidence. He argues that the reason that some Tibetans have difficulty in obtaining passports is because India does not recognize them as citizens and therefore does not grant them a passport, which is a primary document of citizenship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  Moreover, the applicant argues, the RAD erred in finding that the applicant had not put forward any evidence as to why he would be refused Indian citizenship. His burden was to show that the granting of citizenship was not within his control and there was ample evidence to that effect. The RAD should have deferred to the RPD's finding on that issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  The respondent submits that the RAD's conclusion that the RPD's decision was unreasonable was supported by evidence that shows that the applicant is an Indian citizen by birth, irrespective of the nationality of his parents, and that he does not need to apply for Indian citizenship. This was demonstrated by the two recent decisions of the High Courts of Delhi and Karnataka. The RAD's decision was therefore within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and the law. Although the applicant does not possess a birth certificate, he can establish his birth date to the Indian authorities through his other documents issued by the Indian government.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice O'Reilly accepted arguments that are similar to those of the applicant in this matter. The applicant also relies upon  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ 
 Hua Ma 
 ].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  The facts of  
 Wanchuk 
  are virtually the same as those of the matter before me. As no meaningful distinction can be drawn, the principle of judicial comity would normally require that I follow my colleague's decision in the interest of advancing certainty in the law. One exception to this principle arises when the previous decision failed to apply a binding authority that would produce a different result:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . As I will discuss below, I believe that  
 Williams 
  is binding on me in the circumstances of this case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  In  
 Khan 
 , a Tibetan woman had married a citizen of Guyana and moved there. The couple then sought refugee protection in Canada. The RPD concluded, among other things, that the wife could have become a citizen of Guyana due to her marriage. The relevant provision from the Constitution of Guyana, reproduced at para 8, establishes the right of a foreign national to obtain Guyanese citizenship upon marriage, "subject to such exceptions or qualifications as may be prescribed in the interests of national security and public policy".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  At para 21, Justice Lemieux pointed to these discretionary exceptions and explained that it was improper for the RPD to speculate that the wife would succeed if she applied for citizenship in Guyana:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The determining error the tribunal made was to trespass upon forbidden territory when, after recognizing the authorities in Guyana were not compelled on her application to grant Mrs. Khan citizenship, it (the tribunal) could opine how the Minister in Guyana might exercise the discretion conferred upon him. Such circumstances are not within her control. Mrs. Khan is not obligated to seek Guyana's protection before she seeks Canada's.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  In my view, the qualifications to the right to acquire citizenship in Guyana took the matter out of the scope of the control principle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  In  
 Hua Ma 
 , the adult applicants were born in China but moved to the Solomon Islands and acquired citizenship there, thereby losing their Chinese citizenship. The Chinese legislation did not confer a clear right to reacquire citizenship. Further, these applicants had several children, in contravention of China's one-child policy. At para 116, Justice Russell observed that there was evidence that China required ex-citizens to pay steep fees or undergo sterilization in order to reacquire citizenship. For these reasons, the Court accepted that obtaining Chinese citizenship was not within the applicants' control. Justice Russell held, at para 119, that requiring them to apply first in China would "impose an intolerable burden upon people" in their position.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  The respondent drew my attention to a recent decision by  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In  
 Dolker 
 , the determinative issue was whether the RPD's finding that the applicant was a citizen of India was reasonable. Justice Hughes upheld that finding but went on to consider, in  
 obiter, 
  whether she should have at least made an effort to become a citizen if she was not one already. Having reviewed the jurisprudence, he concluded, at para 27, that no Canadian authority states that an applicant must first seek and then be refused citizenship in a safe country where they are entitled to do so before claiming refugee status in Canada. Indeed, Justice Lemieux in  
 Khan 
  clearly stated the contrary.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Nonetheless, Justice Hughes noted, at paras 28-29, that if reasonable steps had been taken and pursued, a failure to secure citizenship in the safe country would go a long way toward bolstering a claim for refugee protection in Canada. There is nothing  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 , he observed, that suggests that a claimant need not even apply or take other reasonable steps to acquire citizenship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  Here the applicant does not dispute that he is entitled to citizenship under Indian legislation by virtue of his birth in that country. Moreover, his expired Indian identity certificate bore a "no objection to return" stamp and the RPD noted that he had travelled to England, Italy, Switzerland and Singapore prior to coming to Canada to seek protection. He argues, however, that Indian officials do not recognize the citizenship rights of Tibetans despite the legal framework. If he applies for any citizenship documents, such as a passport, he contends that his application may be refused at the discretion of those officials.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  I cannot agree with the applicant. Section 96 of the  
 IRPA 
  plainly refers to "countries of nationality", not to countries of nationality where an individual can assert all of his nationality rights without impediment. The Indian legislation is unequivocal that the applicant is a citizen by birth. Two state high courts in India have endorsed that view. The applicant cannot allege that he is not an Indian citizen because some officials might discriminate against him and deny that he is a citizen - no matter how persuasive the evidence of discrimination may be.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  If the applicant requests citizenship documents in India, such as a passport, and is denied, he can bring a court challenge similar to the ones described in the documentary evidence. In  
 Williams 
 , at para 27, the Court of Appeal held that an applicant must make attempts to acquire citizenship in any safe country where it is available to him. The same would seem to apply to the enforcement of rights to which the applicant is entitled by law, as a citizen, notwithstanding efforts at obstruction by officials. By the applicant's own admission at the RPD, he has never made any attempt to acquire or enforce rights of Indian citizenship. He merely speculates that he will not be able to succeed, despite the legislation and jurisprudence in his favour. In my view, he cannot claim protection in Canada without making any effort to avail himself of Indian nationality, to which he is entitled as a matter of law in that country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  This is where I must, with respect, decline to follow  
 Wanchuk 
 . At para 10 of that decision, Justice O'Reilly expressed the view that obtaining Indian citizenship was a "mere possibility" for a similarly situated applicant, since it might require litigation. That does not, in my view, amount to the level of the "intolerable burden" that Justice Russell found to apply  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Ma 
  in light of the one child policy and other considerations in China. Nor is it consistent with the teachings of  
 Williams 
 . Applicants are expected to take reasonable steps to acquire or enforce any citizenship rights which are available to them. A right which is enshrined in legislation and has been enforced by the courts amounts to more than a "mere possibility". There is nothing unreasonable about expecting the applicant to take legal action if his state of nationality attempts to deny his rights.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  It was open to the RAD to assign little probative weight to the affidavit of the applicant's former counsel and to conclude that the lack of a birth certificate would not negate his citizenship rights in India, given his other government-issued documents which establish his date of birth in that country. Its findings on nationality and the right to claim citizenship in India were, on the evidence, within the acceptable range of reasonableness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 B. Did the RAD breach the duty of fairness by dismissing the applicant's claim against India without giving him the opportunity to be heard?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  The applicant misconstrues the RAD's explanation for dismissing his claim against India. The RAD did not suggest that the applicant should have predicted that the Minister would appeal the RPD's finding that he is not an Indian citizen. Rather, it suggested that he should have foreseen that his citizenship would be disputed at the RPD and, therefore, that he should have disclosed any fear he might have with respect to India in his original refugee claim. The RAD also faulted the applicant for not providing any evidence or argument on India when responding to the Minister's appeal of the RPD decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  The applicant bore the onus of substantiating his claim. When he applied for protection, the applicant should have known that his citizenship would be at issue. Since he was born in India and lived there his entire life, he should have foreseen that a decision-maker, whether the RPD or the RAD, could possibly determine that he was an Indian citizen. It was his responsibility to substantiate his claim with respect to all possible countries of reference. Since he did not allege a well-founded fear of persecution in India, he cannot now complain that he was not given an opportunity to be heard on the matter.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  The Minister clearly disputed the RPD's finding that the applicant is not an Indian citizen in his memorandum submitted to the RAD. The applicant had fair notice that the RAD might overturn that finding. Yet instead of offering some evidence or argument on a well-founded fear of persecution in India, his memorandum to the RAD simply requested that the RAD return the matter to the RPD if it should find that he is an Indian citizen. He cannot now complain that he was denied an opportunity to lead evidence relating to a well-founded fear of persecution in India. Justice Zinn made a similar observation in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> which I endorse.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  The facts of this matter do not disclose any breach of the duty of fairness. The application will, therefore, be dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VI. Certified Questions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  At the close of the hearing of this matter, I reserved my decision and indicated to counsel that I would grant them an opportunity to make submissions on the certification of questions before issuing a judgment, if I should decline to follow  
 Wanchuk 
 . These reasons will therefore be provided to the parties and otherwise circulated. Counsel for the applicant will have seven days from the date of these reasons to file and serve representations regarding certification. Thereafter, if counsel for the applicant has served and filed such representations, counsel for the respondent will have seven days to serve and file responding submissions. In the event that responding submissions are served and filed, counsel for the applicant will have a further three days to serve and file reply submissions. Judgment will then be issued.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Le juge Mosley 
  [Traduction]: Dans la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la  
 Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés 
 , LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), M. Chime Tretsetsang conteste la décision de la Section d'appel des réfugiés (la SAR), qui a accueilli l'appel que le ministre avait interjeté à l'encontre de la décision rendue par la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Pour les motifs qui suivent, la présente demande sera rejetée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II.  
 Les faits  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  M. Tretsetsang est d'ethnicité tibétaine. Il est né en Inde le 5 octobre 1968. Ses parents avaient fui en Inde lorsque le gouvernement chinois avait pris le contrôle du Tibet en 1959.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  M. Tretsetsang est entré au Canada le 3 mai 2013, avec un passeport indien qui, selon lui, était frauduleux. Il a présenté une demande d'asile, dans laquelle il alléguait qu'il était apatride et que l'Inde l'expulserait en Chine, où il serait persécuté en raison de sa religion (le bouddhisme) et de ses opinions politiques (soutien au dalaï-lama et opposition au gouvernement de la Chine). Il n'avait pas demandé la citoyenneté indienne lorsqu'il vivait en Inde.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Le 20 août 2013, la SPR a accueilli sa demande d'asile. Le tribunal a reconnu que le  
 Citizenship Act, 1955 
  de l'Inde prescrivait qu'une personne née en Inde entre le 26 janvier 1950 et le 1er juillet 1987 avait la citoyenneté indienne, sans égard à la nationalité de ses parents. Le demandeur n'avait pas d'acte de naissance, mais il avait en sa possession un document de voyage indien connu comme étant un certificat d'identité qui énonçait son lieu de naissance en Inde au cours de la période pertinente. Ce certificat, maintenant expiré, portait aussi un timbre se lisant ainsi: [traduction] « Rien ne s'oppose à un retour en Inde ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  La SPR a fait référence à la preuve relative à la situation dans le pays en cause qui donnait à penser que les Tibétains nés durant cette période pouvaient avoir des difficultés à obtenir des documents de citoyenneté indienne. Relativement peu de Tibétains ont présenté avec succès une demande de citoyenneté indienne, et ils ont [traduction] « éprouvé des difficultés » en ce faisant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  La SPR a conclu, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le demandeur n'était pas un citoyen de l'Inde et qu'il ne pouvait être tenu d'y retourner, puisqu'il ne disposait pas d'un droit de résidence protégé dans ce pays. La SPR a conclu qu'il y avait une possibilité sérieuse qu'il soit persécuté en Chine en raison de sa religion et de ses opinions politiques.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  Le ministre a introduit un appel devant la SAR. La question déterminante, a expliqué la SAR, était de savoir si, dans le cas de M. Tretsetsang, il était en son pouvoir d'obtenir la citoyenneté en Inde, et elle a appliqué l'arrêt  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( 
 Williams 
 ). La SAR a conclu qu'elle devait examiner la décision de la SPR en fonction de la norme de la décision raisonnable. Dans sa décision datée du 11 décembre 2013, la SAR a accueilli l'appel du ministre et jugé que M. Tretsetsang n'était pas un réfugié. Ce faisant, la SAR a rejeté son argument selon lequel l'affaire devait être renvoyée à la SPR sur la question relative à la persécution en Inde. La SAR a conclu que M. Tretsetsang n'avait pas établi qu'il craignait avec raison d'être persécuté dans ce pays.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III.  
 Les questions en litige  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  La présente demande soulève deux questions:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. La SAR a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que le demandeur était un citoyen de l'Inde?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. La SAR a-t-elle manqué à son obligation d'équité en rejetant la prétention du demandeur à l'encontre de l'Inde, sans lui donner l'occasion de se faire entendre?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 La norme de contrôle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  La première question en litige est une question mixte de droit et de fait susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 ), au paragraphe 54.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  L'allégation d'entorse à l'équité procédurale appelle un contrôle en fonction de la norme de la décision correcte:  
 Dunsmuir 
 , précité, au paragraphe 129;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  
 Établissement de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V.  
 Analyse  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 A. 
  La SAR a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que le demandeur était un citoyen de l'Inde?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  Je conviens avec les parties que le critère approprié est énoncé dans l'arrêt  
 Williams 
 , précité, aux paragraphes 19 à 27. Dans cette affaire, la Cour d'appel fédérale a affirmé qu'un demandeur ne se verra pas accorder la qualité de personne à protéger au Canada si l'acquisition de la citoyenneté dans un pays sûr est une question de « simples formalités » ou de « contrôle » de la part de ce demandeur.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  Le critère du contrôle énoncé par le juge Décary était tiré des motifs du jugement du juge Rothstein, qui siégeait alors à la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 77:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Dans l'arrêt  
 Williams 
 , le juge Décary a ajouté au paragraphe 22:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Le fait de ne pas avoir de nationalité ne doit pas relever du contrôle d'un [demandeur].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Le véritable critère est, selon moi, le suivant: s'il est en son pouvoir d'obtenir la citoyenneté d'un pays pour lequel il n'a aucune crainte fondée d'être persécuté, la qualité de réfugié sera refusée au demandeur. Bien que des expressions comme « acquisition de la citoyenneté de plein droit » ou « par l'accomplissement de simples formalités » aient été employées, il est préférable de formuler le critère en parlant de « pouvoir, faculté ou contrôle du demandeur », car cette expression englobe divers types de situations. De plus, ce critère dissuade les demandeurs d'asile de rechercher le pays le plus accommodant, une démarche qui est incompatible avec l'aspect « subsidiaire » de la protection internationale des réfugiés reconnue dans l'arrêt  
 Ward 
  et, contrairement à ce que l'avocat de l'intimé a laissé entendre, ce critère ne se limite pas à de simples formalités comme le serait le dépôt de documents appropriés. Le critère du « contrôle » exprime aussi une idée qui ressort de la définition du réfugié, en l'occurrence le fait que l'absence de « volonté » du demandeur à accomplir les démarches nécessaires pour obtenir la protection de l'État entraîne le rejet de sa demande d'asile à moins que cette absence s'explique par la crainte même de persécution. Le paragraphe 106 du  
 Guide des procédures et critères à appliquer pour déterminer le statut de réfugié 
  précise bien que « [c] haque fois qu'elle peut être réclamée, la protection nationale l'emporte sur la protection internationale ». Dans l'arrêt  
 Ward 
 , à la page 752, la Cour suprême du Canada fait observer, à la page 752, que « [l] orsqu'il est possible de l'obtenir, la protection de l'État d'origine est la seule solution qui s'offre à un demandeur ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Dans l'arrêt  
 Williams 
 , précité, la Cour d'appel fédérale a fait remarquer, au paragraphe 23: « Il importe peu que la citoyenneté d'un autre pays ait été obtenue  
 de naissance 
 , par naturalisation ou par succession d'États,  
 pourvu que le demandeur ait la faculté de l'obtenir 
  » [non souligné dans l'original]. Au paragraphe 27, la Cour d'appel écrit que:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [...] lorsque la citoyenneté d'un autre pays  
 peut être réclamée 
 , le demandeur est censé entreprendre des démarches pour l'obtenir et [...] il se voit refuser la qualité de réfugié s'il est démontré qu'il était en son pouvoir d'acquérir cette autre citoyenneté.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [Souligné dans l'original.]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Dans la présente affaire, rien n'indique que le demandeur ait déjà tenté d'acquérir la citoyenneté indienne.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  La SAR s'est appuyée sur la preuve relative à des jugements rendus par la Haute Cour de Delhi et par la Haute Cour de Karnataka pour conclure que: (1) les Tibétains qui sont dans la position du demandeur sont des citoyens indiens de naissance; (2) ces jugements lient le gouvernement de l'Inde; (3) ces personnes n'ont pas à demander la citoyenneté, parce qu'elles la possèdent automatiquement; (4) le fait que certains Tibétains ont eu de la difficulté à obtenir un passeport n'établit pas qu'ils n'ont pas la faculté d'acquérir la citoyenneté.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Le demandeur prétend qu'aucune de ces conclusions n'est étayée par la preuve. Il fait valoir que la raison pour laquelle certains Tibétains ont eu de la difficulté à obtenir un passeport est que l'Inde ne les reconnaît pas en tant que citoyens et, par conséquent, ne leur accorde pas de passeport, ce qui constitue un document de citoyenneté fondamental.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  En outre, fait valoir le demandeur, la SAR a commis une erreur en concluant qu'il n'avait pas présenté d'éléments de preuve quant à la raison pour laquelle la citoyenneté indienne lui serait refusée. Son fardeau était de démontrer qu'il n'avait pas la faculté d'acquérir la citoyenneté, et il y avait une preuve abondante à cet effet. La SAR aurait dû s'en remettre à la conclusion de la SPR sur cette question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  Le défendeur soutient que la conclusion de la SAR selon laquelle la décision de la SPR était déraisonnable était étayée par la preuve qui démontrait que le demandeur était un citoyen indien de naissance, sans égard à la nationalité de ses parents, et qu'il n'avait pas besoin de faire une demande en vue d'obtenir la citoyenneté indienne. Cela a été démontré par les deux jugements récents des hautes cours de Delhi et de Karnataka. La décision de la SAR appartenait donc aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Bien que le demandeur ne possède pas d'acte de naissance, il peut prouver sa date de naissance aux autorités indiennes au moyen des autres documents délivrés par le gouvernement de l'Inde.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Dans la décision  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge O'Reilly a accepté des arguments qui ressemblent à ceux du demandeur en l'espèce. Le demandeur invoque également les décisions  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( 
 Khan 
 ), aux paragraphes 19 à 21, et  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( 
 Hua Ma 
 ), aux paragraphes 108 à 122.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  Les faits de l'affaire  
 Wanchuk 
  sont pratiquement les mêmes que ceux de l'affaire dont je suis saisi. Comme une distinction significative ne peut être établie, le principe de la courtoisie judiciaire exigerait normalement que je suive la décision de mon collègue dans l'intérêt de favoriser la certitude du droit. Il peut être dérogé à ce principe lorsque la décision antérieure n'a pas examiné la jurisprudence qui aurait donné lieu à un résultat différent:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 62. Comme j'en discuterai ultérieurement, je crois que je suis lié par l'arrêt  
 Williams 
  dans les circonstances de la présente affaire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  Dans l'affaire  
 Khan 
 , une femme tibétaine s'était mariée avec un citoyen du Guyana et s'était installée là-bas. Le couple avait par la suite sollicité l'asile au Canada. La SPR avait conclu, entre autres choses, que la femme aurait pu devenir citoyenne du Guyana en raison de son mariage. La disposition applicable de la Constitution du Guyana, reproduite au paragraphe 8 de la décision, établit le droit d'un étranger d'acquérir la citoyenneté guyanienne par mariage, mais ce droit [traduction] « doit être subordonné aux exceptions ou aux restrictions prévues dans l'intérêt de la sécurité nationale ou de l'ordre public ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Au paragraphe 21, le juge Lemieux a souligné ces exceptions discrétionnaires et a expliqué qu'il n'était pas approprié que la SPR avance l'hypothèse que la femme obtiendrait la citoyenneté du Guyana si elle la demandait:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 L'erreur déterminante qu'a commise le tribunal a été de faire une incursion en territoire interdit lorsque, après avoir reconnu que les autorités guyaniennes n'étaient pas tenues d'accepter la demande de citoyenneté de Mme Khan, il s'est exprimé sur la manière dont le ministre guyanien pouvait exercer le pouvoir discrétionnaire qui lui a été conféré. De telles circonstances sont hors du contrôle de la demanderesse. Mme Khan n'est pas obligée de demander la protection de la Guyana avant de demander celle du Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  À mon avis, les restrictions quant au droit d'acquérir la citoyenneté au Guyana ont mis l'affaire hors de la portée du principe de contrôle énoncé dans l'arrêt  
 Williams 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Dans l'affaire  
 Hua Ma 
 , les demandeurs adultes étaient nés en Chine, mais avaient déménagé aux Îles Salomon et acquis la citoyenneté là-bas, de sorte qu'ils avaient perdu leur citoyenneté chinoise. La législation chinoise ne confère pas un droit clair de recouvrer la citoyenneté. En outre, ces demandeurs avaient plusieurs enfants, ce qui allait à l'encontre de la politique de la Chine relative à l'enfant unique. Au paragraphe 116 de la décision, le juge Russell a fait observer qu'il y avait des éléments de preuve selon lesquels la Chine exigeait des ex-citoyens de payer des frais élevés ou de subir une stérilisation en vue de recouvrer la citoyenneté. Pour ces motifs, la Cour a accepté l'argument voulant que les demandeurs n'aient pas le pouvoir d'obtenir la citoyenneté chinoise. Le juge Russell a décidé, au paragraphe 119, que le fait d'exiger d'eux qu'il fasse d'abord une demande en Chine « aurait pour effet d'imposer un fardeau intolérable à des personnes » dans leur situation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  Le défendeur a attiré mon attention sur une décision récente du juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Dans l'affaire  
 Dolker 
 , la question déterminante consistait à savoir si la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle la demanderesse était une citoyenne de l'Inde était raisonnable. Le juge Hughes a confirmé cette conclusion, mais a continué pour examiner, dans des remarques incidentes, le point de savoir si la demanderesse aurait dû au moins faire des efforts pour obtenir la citoyenneté, si elle ne l'avait pas déjà. Après un examen de la jurisprudence, il a conclu, au paragraphe 27, qu'aucun précédent au Canada ne posait comme condition qu'un demandeur devait d'abord solliciter, puis se voir refuser, la citoyenneté dans un pays sûr où il a le droit de le faire avant de demander l'asile au Canada. De fait, dans la décision  
 Khan 
 , le juge Lemieux a clairement énoncé le contraire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Néanmoins, le juge Hughes a fait remarquer, aux paragraphes 28 et 29, que, si des mesures raisonnables avaient été prises et poursuivies, le fait de ne pas avoir obtenu la citoyenneté dans un pays sûr contribuerait dans une large mesure à soutenir une demande d'asile au Canada. Il a fait observer qu'il n'y avait rien dans l'arrêt  
 Williams 
  donnant à penser qu'un demandeur n'avait même pas à présenter une demande ou à prendre d'autres mesures raisonnables pour acquérir la citoyenneté.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  En l'espèce, le demandeur ne conteste pas le fait qu'il a droit à la citoyenneté, sous le régime de la législation indienne, en raison de sa naissance dans ce pays. De plus, son certificat d'identité indien qui est expiré porte un timbre indiquant [traduction] « Rien ne s'oppose à un retour », et la SPR a fait remarquer que le demandeur avait voyagé en Angleterre, en Italie, en Suisse et à Singapour avant de venir au Canada pour demander l'asile. Le demandeur fait cependant valoir que les fonctionnaires indiens ne reconnaissent pas les droits à la citoyenneté des Tibétains, malgré le cadre juridique en place. S'il demande des documents relatifs à la citoyenneté, tels qu'un passeport, il prétend que sa demande peut être refusée à la discrétion de ces fonctionnaires.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  Je ne peux être d'accord avec le demandeur. L'article 96 de la Loi renvoie clairement aux « pays dont elle a la nationalité », et non aux pays de nationalité où une personne peut faire valoir l'ensemble de ses droits relatifs à la nationalité sans empêchement. La législation indienne est sans équivoque et prévoit que le demandeur est un citoyen de naissance. Deux hautes cours d'état en Inde ont approuvé ce point de vue. Le demandeur ne peut pas alléguer qu'il n'est pas un citoyen indien du fait que certains fonctionnaires puissent faire usage de discrimination à son égard et nier le fait qu'il ait la citoyenneté - peu importe jusqu'à quel point la preuve relative à la discrimination peut être convaincante.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  Si le demandeur demande des documents relatifs à la citoyenneté en Inde, tels qu'un passeport, et qu'ils lui sont refusés, il peut intenter un recours judiciaire semblable à ceux décrits dans la preuve documentaire. Dans l'arrêt  
 Williams 
 , au paragraphe 27, la Cour d'appel a jugé qu'un demandeur devait tenter d'acquérir la citoyenneté dans tout pays sûr où il pouvait la réclamer. Le même principe semblerait s'appliquer à l'exercice de droits conférés par la loi au demandeur, en tant que citoyen, en dépit des efforts d'obstruction déployés par les fonctionnaires. Selon l'admission qu'a faite le demandeur à la SPR, il n'a jamais tenté d'obtenir ou d'exercer les droits relatifs à la citoyenneté indienne. Il pose simplement comme hypothèse qu'il ne sera pas en mesure de le faire, malgré la législation et la jurisprudence en sa faveur. À mon avis, il ne peut demander l'asile au Canada sans faire quelque effort que ce soit pour se réclamer de la nationalité indienne, à laquelle il a droit dans ce pays.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  C'est ici que je dois, avec égards, refuser de suivre  
 Wanchuk 
 . Au paragraphe 10 de cette décision, le juge O'Reilly a exprimé l'avis que le fait d'obtenir la citoyenneté indienne était une « simple possibilité » pour un demandeur se trouvant dans une situation similaire, puisque cela pourrait nécessiter de porter la cause devant les tribunaux. Cela, à mon avis, n'équivaut pas au niveau de « fardeau intolérable » que le juge Russell a décidé d'appliquer dans la décision  
 Hua Ma 
 , à la lumière de la politique relative à l'enfant unique en Chine et d'autres considérations. Et cela n'est pas compatible avec les enseignements de l'arrêt  
 Williams 
 . On s'attend à ce que les demandeurs prennent des mesures raisonnables pour obtenir ou exercer tout droit relatif à la citoyenneté dont ils disposent. Un droit qui est consacré dans la législation et qui a été reconnu par les tribunaux représente plus qu'une « simple possibilité ». Il n'y a rien de déraisonnable dans le fait de s'attendre à ce que le demandeur intente un recours en justice si son pays de nationalité tente de lui nier ses droits.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  Il était loisible à la SAR d'accorder peu de valeur probante à l'affidavit de l'ancien conseil du demandeur et de conclure que l'absence d'un acte de naissance ne nierait pas l'existence de ses droits de citoyen en Inde, compte tenu des autres documents en sa possession, délivrés par le gouvernement, qui établissaient sa date de naissance dans ce pays. Les conclusions de la SAR quant à la nationalité et au droit de revendiquer la citoyenneté en Inde appartenaient, selon la preuve, à l'éventail acceptable de décisions raisonnables.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 B.  
 La SAR a-t-elle manqué à son obligation d'équité en rejetant la prétention du demandeur à l'encontre de l'Inde, sans lui donner l'occasion de se faire entendre?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  Le demandeur interprète mal l'explication donnée par la SAR pour rejeter sa prétention à l'égard de l'Inde. La SAR n'a pas laissé entendre que le demandeur aurait dû prédire que le ministre interjetterait appel de la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle il n'était pas un citoyen indien. La SAR a plutôt laissé entendre qu'il aurait dû prévoir que sa citoyenneté serait débattue devant la SPR et, par conséquent, qu'il aurait dû divulguer toute crainte qu'il pouvait avoir à l'égard de l'Inde dans sa demande d'asile initiale. La SAR a aussi pris en défaut le demandeur pour ne pas avoir fourni une preuve ou un argument concernant l'Inde lorsqu'il a répondu à l'appel interjeté par le ministre à l'encontre de la décision de la SPR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  Le demandeur avait le fardeau d'étayer sa demande. Lorsqu'il a demandé l'asile, le demandeur aurait dû savoir que sa citoyenneté serait mise en cause. Puisqu'il est né en Inde et qu'il y a vécu toute sa vie, il aurait dû prévoir qu'un décideur, que ce soit à la SPR ou à la SAR, pouvait juger qu'il était un citoyen indien. Il avait la responsabilité d'étayer sa demande quant à tous les pays de référence possibles. Puisqu'il n'a pas allégué craindre avec raison d'être persécuté en Inde, il ne peut se plaindre qu'on ne lui ait pas donné l'occasion de se faire entendre sur cette question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  Dans son mémoire présenté à la SAR, le ministre a clairement contesté la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle le demandeur n'était pas un citoyen indien. Le demandeur avait ainsi reçu un avis raisonnable que la SAR pouvait infirmer cette conclusion. Pourtant, au lieu d'offrir une preuve ou un argument sur une crainte bien fondée de persécution en Inde, il a simplement demandé, dans son mémoire à la SAR, que celle-ci renvoie l'affaire à la SPR si elle devait conclure qu'il était un citoyen indien. Il ne peut maintenant se plaindre qu'on lui a refusé l'occasion de présenter une preuve quant à une crainte bien fondée de persécution en Inde. Le juge Zinn a formulé une observation semblable, que j'approuve, dans la décision  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  Aucun manquement à l'obligation d'équité ne ressort des faits de la présente affaire. La demande sera donc rejetée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VI.  
 Les questions en vue de la certification  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  À la fin de l'audience dans la présente affaire, j'ai pris ma décision en délibéré et mentionné aux avocats que je leur donnerais l'occasion d'avancer des observations quant à la certification de questions avant de rendre un jugement, dans le cas où je refuserais de suivre la décision  
 Wanchuk 
 . Les présents motifs seront par conséquent fournis aux parties et feront par ailleurs l'objet d'une diffusion. L'avocat du demandeur disposera de sept jours à compter de la date des présents motifs pour déposer et signifier des observations au sujet de la certification. Par la suite, si l'avocat du demandeur a signifié et déposé de telles observations, l'avocat du défendeur aura sept jours pour signifier et déposer des observations en réponse. Advenant que des observations en réponse soient signifiées et déposées, l'avocat du demandeur aura un délai additionnel de trois jours pour signifier et déposer des observations en réplique. Le jugement sera ensuite rendu.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

Mosley, J.
: In this application for judicial review brought under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [
IRPA
], Denbel Bekelech challenges a decision rendered by the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD], which dismissed her appeal from a decision of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] rejecting her claim for refugee protection. For the reasons that follow, this application is dismissed.
I.
Background
[2]
The applicant is a citizen of Ethiopia. Her ethnicity is part Oromo and part Gurage. The ethnicity of her husband is Oromo. According to the applicant, the Ethiopian authorities perceive her husband as a member of the Oromo Liberation Front [OLF], a group that is currently engaged in armed struggle against the government. She alleges that the authorities arrested, imprisoned and tortured her husband in January 2012. After she posted bail and secured his release in June 2012, he disappeared to hide from the authorities.
[3]
The applicant alleges that she was arrested on July 11, 2012 and held for one month because the authorities wanted to draw her husband out of hiding. She alleges that she was arrested a second time on January 3, 2013 and detained until January 5, 2013.
[4]
The applicant also alleges that she supports an opposition party named Unity for Democracy and Justice [UDJ], having voted for it and distributed pamphlets on its behalf. She attributes her persecution to her support for this party and her husband's affiliation with the OLF.
[5]
On May 28, 2013, the applicant entered Canada, where she has family, on a visa. Thereafter, she applied for refugee protection due to her political opinion.
[6]
The RPD rejected the applicant's refugee claim in a decision dated September 6, 2013. The applicant filed a notice of appeal at the RAD on December 20, 2013. She submitted an appeal record on January 6, 2014. On January 31, 2014, she brought a motion to admit new evidence to the RAD record. The RAD dismissed the applicant's appeal by decision dated April 10, 2014.
[7]
While the decision under review, properly speaking, is the RAD decision, it makes sense to begin with an overview of the RPD decision. The RPD panel declared that the determinative issue was credibility. It drew several negative inferences against Mrs Bekelech's credibility.
[8]
First, the applicant was inconsistent about the circumstances surrounding her arrest. In her basis of claim form [BOC], she stated that she had been arrested twice. After her first arrest, she had been told to report to the police station regularly, and she was arrested a second time in January 2013 while reporting. At the hearing, the applicant testified that the police had come to her home at night to arrest her the second time. She could not explain this contradiction to the panel's satisfaction. The panel considered this contradiction highly material because her second arrest was the event which allegedly motivated her to seek refuge in another country.
[9]
Second, the applicant was inconsistent about the reasons the police arrested her. In her BOC, she stated that the police arrested her in January 2013 because they believed that she had been distributing political flyers for the UDJ party. At the hearing, the applicant said that she had not distributed flyers and she did not know why the police suspected her. She could not explain why she had written that she had been arrested for distributing flyers in her BOC.
[10]
Third, the applicant did not offer credible testimony on being followed by government officials. In her BOC, she alleged that she had been followed for about two months. When asked to provide examples at the hearing, she offered very general and vague testimony. She could not describe a single specific example or incident.
[11]
Finally, the panel noted that there were inconsistencies between the applicant's knowledge of her husband's activities as expressed in her BOC and her oral testimony. In the BOC, she provided a detailed account of her husband's activities, replete with dates and background information on the OLF. However, her oral testimony was vague and ambiguous.
[12]
The RPD concluded that the applicant's allegations lacked credibility. It determined that there was no serious possibility that the applicant would be persecuted. It further determined, on the balance of probabilities, that she would not face torture or a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment in Ethiopia.
[13]
In her appeal to the RAD, the applicant provided the following pieces of new evidence:
1. An affidavit she swore;
2. An audiologist's report;
3. A letter from a friend dated August 1, 2013; and
4. An article printed from the Internet about hearing loss.
[14]
The RAD member considers the admissibility of this new evidence. He explains that he will use the test developed in the context of Pre-Removal Risk Assessment applications [PRRAs] in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Evidence is admissible if it meets four criteria: credibility, newness, relevance and materiality.
[15]
The applicant's affidavit proffers evidence that was not before the RPD. In particular, it states (1) that her hearing became impaired when she was struck on her left ear during her second term of imprisonment and (2) that her son called her a few weeks after the RPD hearing to tell her that the authorities were searching for him. The RAD does not accept the affidavit, since the applicant would have been aware of any hearing impairment at the time of the hearing and could have given that evidence to the RPD. There was no indication in the RPD record that the applicant raised the issue or required accommodation for her hearing loss. The second piece of information fails the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test because it lacks probative value. It indicates that the authorities are looking for the applicant's son, not the applicant.
[16]
The RAD employs the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test to exclude the three other pieces of evidence as well. The letter from the friend was written after the RPD decision but it did not meet the relevance test as it was vague and lacked probative value. The Internet article contained no date and was of a general nature about improving communication when there was hearing loss.
[17]
The RAD then turns to the evidence which the applicant tendered by way of motion brought under Rule 29 of the
Refugee Appeal Division Rules
, SOR/2012-257 [the Rules]: a letter from her son, Wondemu Yohannes, and Canada Post tracking results for that letter. It is dated December 15, 2013. The applicant received it on January 14, 2014. The author inquires into the applicant's health; states that her husband is alive and probably joined the OLF; and affirms that he plans to travel to South Africa himself to claim refugee protection. The writer does not allege that anyone is looking for the applicant.
[18]
According to the RAD, the letter does not provide any new evidence which would justify altering the RPD decision. Nor has the applicant provided an explanation as to why she was unable to obtain or tender this document at an earlier point in time. The letter is inadmissible under Rule 29 and so a full <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> analysis is not necessary.
[19]
The RAD member then conducts a lengthy standard of review analysis. He concludes that the standard of reasonableness governs the appeal.
[20]
The applicant alleged that the RPD erred in failing to consider documentary evidence in support of her claim, including a letter from Ali Keder, an affidavit from Konjit Mitiku and objective country conditions evidence. The RPD also took no consideration of a receipt from the UJD party corroborating a donation she had made to it.
[21]
The RAD recalls that the RPD is not required to refer to each and every piece of evidence before it. A reviewable error occurs only where the RPD omits to mention important evidence that is directly relevant to a central issue.
[22]
The RAD reviews the evidence mentioned by the applicant. The RAD is satisfied that no error occurred with respect to the letter from Ali Keder, as it refers to the arrest in 2012. By contrast, the RPD's credibility findings related only to the arrest in 2013. The letter did not speak to an issue central to the decision.
[23]
The RAD accepts that some important pieces of evidence were not mentioned in the RPD decision, specifically the affidavit where Konjit Mitiku swears to have visited the applicant while she was in prison, the receipt of the donation to the UDJ and the country conditions evidence. The RAD determines that it was unreasonable for the RPD to conduct its analysis without mentioning this evidence in its reasons.
[24]
The RAD disagrees with the applicant that the RPD erred by failing to conduct an objective risk assessment under section 97. The language used by the RPD shows that it did conduct a section 97 assessment in the RAD's view. The applicant's lack of credibility was equally fatal to her claim under section 96 and section 97. It is trite law that a negative credibility finding in relation to section 96 may obviate the need to consider section 97. Given the RPD's concerns with the applicant's credibility, the cursory nature of its section 97 analysis was reasonable.
[25]
The RAD turns to the issue of credibility. In light of the numerous concerns identified by the RPD and the deference which credibility findings deserve, the RAD concludes that these findings pass muster on the standard of reasonableness. Consequently, the RAD confirms the RPD's decision.
II.
Issues
[26]
This application raises three issues:
1. Did the RAD err in its standard of review analysis?
2. Did the RAD err in its analysis of the new evidence?
3. Did the RAD err in its analysis of credibility?
III.
Standard of Review
[27]
The standard of review which the Court ought to apply to the RAD's selection of a standard of review is the subject of differing jurisprudence in this  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Phelan selected the standard of correctness, characterizing the RAD's choice of a standard of review as a question of law of general interest to the legal system. Other members of the Court have taken a different view and preferred the standard of reasonableness, characterizing the issue as a legal question within the expertise of the decision-maker: see e.g.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[28]
I do not deem it necessary to express an opinion on this matter in this case. As an appeal has been brought against <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court of Appeal will soon have an opportunity to answer this question. In any event, nothing turns on the Court-to-RAD standard of review here, since the RAD's selection of a deferential standard of review was both correct and reasonable, as I explain below.
[29]
The standard of review for the second issue is reasonableness, as it involves the RAD's application of its home statute and regulations to the facts before it:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[30]
The RAD did not make independent credibility findings. Rather, it confirmed the credibility findings made by the RPD. Since this required the RAD to evaluate the facts before it in light of its enabling statute, the Court-to-RAD standard of review is reasonableness again.
IV.
Analysis
A.
Did the RAD err in its standard of review analysis?
[31]
The RAD committed no error in deferring to the RPD's findings on questions of fact and credibility despite the live debate in this Court on the appropriate standard of review,
[32]
The Court has sent back decisions where the RAD showed deference on different issues. For instance, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the RAD deferred to the RPD's state protection analysis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the RAD deferred to the RPD's findings on plausibility but also generalized risk - the latter was a question of mixed fact and law.
[33]
In these cases, the Court has either interpreted the RAD scheme as a hybrid procedure that is somewhat similar to a
de novo
appeal or as a true appeal analogous to those performed by appellate courts. Yet both strands in the jurisprudence accept the principle that findings of credibility must be shown deference, since the RAD does not typically hold oral hearings and is therefore at a disadvantage in comparison to the RPD.
[34]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Phelan expressed the view that the RAD scheme functions as an appeal
de novo
. Yet he recognized the need for deference when credibility is at issue (para 37). Furthermore, he stated that the standard of review for credibility is not "palpable and overriding error" (paras 54-55). On my interpretation, he implicitly endorsed the standard of reasonableness, as that is the most common deferential standard in our law.
[35]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Roy took the view that the RAD functions like an appellate court, relying on the analytical framework in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . When credibility findings are at issue, he asserted that the RAD ought to apply the standard of review of "palpable and overriding error".
[36]
This debate is largely academic because neither side would agree with the applicant that the standard of correctness applies. If the RAD erred by naming the deferential standard it chose "reasonableness" instead of "palpable and overriding error", nothing turns on it.
[37]
Shortly before the hearing, the applicant brought to my attention a recent case decided by my brother  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In comments made in
obiter
at paras 30-34, Justice Noël questioned the wisdom of allowing the RAD to defer to the RPD's findings, even on questions of credibility. I agree with Justice Noël that an appellate tribunal does not play a judicial review function and deplore any language used by the RAD which points in that direction. However, and with the greatest respect, I do not agree that the RAD should routinely conduct a fresh assessment of credibility on appeals brought before it.
[38]
It is difficult to understand how an administrative tribunal could apply the standard of correctness to findings of credibility on a paper-based appeal. The RPD has a situational advantage when compared to the RAD, as it can observe the claimant in person while the RAD does not do so except in unusual circumstances. If the RAD owed no deference to the RPD's findings on the issue which the RPD is best placed to decide, the statutory scheme would involve unnecessary duplication. The RPD would have no
raison d'être
. This recommends RAD-to-RPD deference on issues of credibility.
[39]
I am satisfied, in any event, that the RAD made its own assessment of the applicant's credibility relying on the very thorough discussion by the RPD of the inconsistencies which it had found between her BOC and testimony.
B.
Did the RAD err in its analysis of the new evidence?
[40]
The RAD was entitled to import the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> factors established for PRRAs when applying the new evidence rule in subsection 110(4).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Shore held that:
Considering the dearth of case law interpreting subsection 110(4) and given the essential similarity between the provisions in question, the Court does not find it unreasonable for the RAD to have referred to the factors set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, to analyse the admissibility of fresh evidence. This case law established a legal meaning to the general application of the words "new evidence," which, in the Court's view, is consistent with Parliament's clear intention with regard to subsection 110(4) to require that the RAD review the RPD's decision as is, unless new, credible and relevant evidence arose after the rejection,
that might have affected the outcome of the RPD hearing if that evidence had been presented to it
.
[Emphasis in original]
[41]
Moreover, the RAD relied on the express language of Rule 29(4) to exclude new evidence tendered after the appeal record was filed. That Rule explicitly lists some of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> factors.
[42]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 37, Justice Simon Noël expressed reservations about the propriety of transposing <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to the RAD context, referring to the analysis of Justice Gagné in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Once again, I respectfully disagree. As Justice Shore observed in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , subsections 110(4) and 113(a) contain virtually identical language. In light of the overall structure of these provisions, I accord no significance to the slight discrepancy in the French text ("qu'elle n'aurait pas normalement présentés" versus "qu'il n'était pas raisonnable, dans les circonstances, de s'attendre à ce qu'il les ait présentés").
[43]
When interpreting legislative intent, the Court must give priority to the written text in the absence of any lexical ambiguity. The Court's opinions on best policy cannot supplant the text of the law; nor can select passages from the Hansard. In my view, Parliament intended these two provisions to enshrine the same legal test. If Parliament had intended to establish more flexible admissibility rules in RAD appeals, it would not have replicated the restrictive language which governs PRRAs.
[44]
I am satisfied that the RAD reasonably excluded the contested evidence for the reasons it provided. The applicant focused on the RAD's exclusion of her son's letter under Rule 29(4). In my view, the RAD reasonably excluded the letter due to its low relevance and probative value. It also expressed reasonable concerns that the letter could have been available earlier.
C.
Did the RAD err in its analysis of credibility?
[45]
The RPD based its numerous negative credibility findings on significant inconsistencies and contradictions between the applicant's BOC narrative and her oral testimony. The applicant did not dispute these findings during her appeal at the RAD, nor has she done so on this judicial review application. Rather, she insists that the RPD erred by failing to consider documentary evidence which corroborates her allegations and establishes the risk she faces in Ethiopia.
[46]
The RAD lent some support to the applicant's argument, declaring that the RPD behaved unreasonably by failing to mention that evidence. Yet the RAD ultimately upheld the RPD's conclusions because its credibility findings were reasonable in light of the record. The RAD committed no reviewable error in this regard.
[47]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice de Montigny found that the RPD had erred in its state protection analysis but had still reasonably concluded that the applicants lacked credibility. He dismissed the judicial review application for the following reasons, expressed at para 45:
Although the Applicants have demonstrated an error in the assessment of state protection, it is of no consequence because they have failed to establish that they are in need of that protection. The Board member has not found their story credible and, as a result, their fear of persecution is not subjectively grounded. As a result, this application for judicial review ought to be dismissed.
[48]
The same can be said in this case. The RAD implicitly and reasonably determined that the RPD's error was immaterial due to the applicant's lack of credibility. It was reasonable for the RAD to conclude that the unmentioned evidence could not remedy the significant contradictions and inconsistencies in the applicant's testimony. Although counsel for the applicant forcefully argued at the hearing that the RAD should have given some weight to the affidavit of Konjit Mikitu, who allegedly visited the applicant while she was in prison, the failure do so does not establish a reviewable error in my view. On reasonableness review, it does not matter that the Court might have given a different weight to a particular piece of evidence, since the Court is
not
"developing, asserting and enforcing its own view of the matter":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[49]
Counsel for the applicant also reproached the RAD for summarily endorsing the RPD's credibility findings, instead of explaining in depth why they were reasonable. In my view, he seeks to impose a
pro forma
and unnecessary requirement on the RAD to restate in different words what the RPD had so convincingly explained in its decision. The RPD's statement of the inconsistencies spoke for itself.
[50]
Similarly, the RAD's endorsement of the RPD's section 97 analysis was reasonable. In its reasons, the RAD correctly cited
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> for the proposition that a negative credibility finding may obviate the need to consider section 97. I also draw attention to the Court of Appeal's instructions in
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
...where the Board makes a general finding that the claimant lacks credibility, that determination is sufficient to dispose of the claim unless there is independent and credible documentary evidence in the record capable of supporting a positive disposition of the claim. The claimant bears the onus of demonstrating there was such evidence.
[51]
In the case at bar, the applicant provided no independent and credible evidence to show that she faces risk in Ethiopia. The objective documentary evidence describes risks faced by political dissidents and their families. The RPD questioned the applicant's credibility and did not believe that either she or her husband were political dissidents. Consequently, the applicant does not have a profile that places her at risk. The RAD committed no error in confirming the RPD's analysis in this respect.
[52]
This application is dismissed. The parties did not propose questions for certification and none will be certified.
JUDGMENT
[53]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
this application is dismissed. No questions are certified.
.........................
Bekelech Denbel (alias Bekelech  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée en application du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001 c 27 (LIPR), Denbel Bekelech conteste une décision par laquelle la Section d'appel des réfugiés (SAR) a rejeté l'appel qu'elle a interjeté à l'encontre d'une décision par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) a refusé sa demande d'asile. Pour les motifs qui suivent, la demande est rejetée.
I.
Contexte
[2]
La demanderesse est une citoyenne de l'Éthiopie. Son origine ethnique est en partie oromo et en partie gurage. Selon la demanderesse, les autorités éthiopiennes considèrent que son époux est membre du Front de libération oromo (FLO), un groupe actuellement impliqué dans un conflit armé contre le gouvernement. Elle soutient que les autorités ont arrêté son époux, l'ont emprisonné et l'ont torturé en janvier 2012. Après qu'elle a versé sa caution et obtenu sa libération en juin 2012, il a disparu en vue de se cacher des autorités.
[3]
La demanderesse prétend qu'elle a été arrêtée le 11 juillet 2012 et détenue pendant un mois, car les autorités voulaient faire sortir son époux de sa cachette. Elle soutient qu'elle a été arrêtée de nouveau le 3 janvier 2013 et détenue jusqu'au 5 janvier 2013.
[4]
La demanderesse prétend aussi qu'elle appuie un parti d'opposition qui s'appelle Unité pour la démocratie et la justice (UDJ), pour qui elle a voté et distribué des brochures. Elle estime qu'elle est persécutée en raison de l'appui qu'elle manifeste à ce parti et de l'affiliation de son époux au FLO.
[5]
Le 28 mai 2013, la demanderesse est entrée au Canada, où habitent des membres de sa famille, munie d'un visa. Elle a ensuite présenté une demande d'asile fondée sur ses opinions politiques.
[6]
La SPR a rejeté la demande d'asile présentée par la demanderesse dans une décision datée du 6 septembre 2013. La demanderesse a déposé un avis d'appel à la SAR le 20 décembre 2013 ainsi qu'un dossier d'appel le 6 janvier 2014. Le 31 janvier 2014, elle a introduit une requête en vue de faire admettre de nouveaux éléments de preuve au dossier de la SAR. La SAR a rejeté l'appel de la demanderesse dans une décision datée du 10 avril 2014.
[7]
Bien que la décision faisant l'objet du contrôle soit, à proprement parler, la décision de la SAR, il est logique de passer d'abord en revue la décision de la SPR. Le tribunal de la SPR a déclaré que la question déterminante était la crédibilité. Il a tiré plusieurs inférences défavorables concernant la crédibilité de Mme Bekelech.
[8]
Premièrement, la demanderesse a fait preuve d'incohérence en ce qui concerne les circonstances entourant son arrestation. Dans son formulaire Fondement de la demande d'asile (FDA), elle a déclaré qu'elle avait été arrêtée à deux reprises. Après sa première arrestation, elle a reçu la consigne de se présenter régulièrement au poste de police, où elle a été arrêtée pour une seconde fois en janvier 2013 au cours d'une de ces visites de contrôle. À l'audience, la demanderesse a déclaré que la seconde fois, la police l'avait arrêtée chez elle pendant la nuit. Elle n'a pas été en mesure d'expliquer cette contradiction à la satisfaction du tribunal. Le tribunal a jugé que cette contradiction était très importante, car ce serait cette seconde arrestation qui aurait poussé la demanderesse à chercher refuge dans un autre pays.
[9]
Deuxièmement, la demanderesse a fait preuve d'incohérence en ce qui concerne les motifs pour lesquels la police l'a arrêtée. Dans son FDA, elle a déclaré que les forces policières l'avaient arrêtée en janvier 2013, car elles croyaient qu'elle avait distribué des brochures politiques pour le parti UDJ. À l'audience, la demanderesse a dit qu'elle n'avait jamais distribué de brochures et qu'elle ignorait pourquoi elle avait éveillé les soupçons de la police. Elle n'a pas été en mesure d'expliquer pourquoi elle avait écrit qu'elle avait été arrêtée pour avoir distribué des brochures dans son FDA.
[10]
Troisièmement, la demanderesse n'a pas livré un témoignage crédible sur la surveillance dont elle fait l'objet de la part de représentants du gouvernement. Dans son FDA, elle a prétendu qu'elle était suivie depuis environ deux mois. À l'audience, lorsqu'elle a été invitée à donner des exemples, elle a livré un témoignage très général et vague. Elle n'a pas été en mesure de donner un seul exemple ou de décrire un seul incident précis.
[11]
Enfin, le tribunal a relevé des incohérences entre le FDA de la demanderesse et le témoignage qu'elle a livré de vive voix au sujet de ses connaissances à l'égard des activités de son époux. Dans son FDA, elle a fait un compte rendu détaillé des activités de son époux comprenant plein de dates et de renseignements contextuels sur le FLO. Cependant, son témoignage de vive voix était vague et ambigu.
[12]
La SPR a conclu que les allégations de la demanderesse manquaient de crédibilité. Elle a jugé que la demanderesse ne risquait pas sérieusement d'être persécutée. Elle a ensuite conclu, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la demanderesse ne risquerait pas la torture ou qu'elle ne serait pas exposée à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités en Éthiopie.
[13]
Dans le cadre de l'appel interjeté devant la SAR, la demanderesse a fourni les nouveaux éléments de preuve suivants:
1. un affidavit qu'elle a fait sous serment;
2. un rapport préparé par un audiologiste;
3. une lettre d'un ami datée du 1er août 2013;
4. un article tiré d'Internet sur la perte auditive.
[14]
Le commissaire de la SAR a évalué l'admissibilité de ces nouveaux éléments de preuve. Il a expliqué qu'il allait utiliser les critères établis dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), dans le contexte d'un examen des risques avant renvoi (ERAR). Les éléments de preuve sont admissibles s'ils respectent quatre critères, à savoir la crédibilité, la nouveauté, la pertinence et le caractère substantiel.
[15]
L'affidavit de la demanderesse fournit des éléments de preuve qui n'avaient pas été présentés à la SPR. En particulier, cet affidavit comprend les déclarations suivantes: (1) elle a subi une perte auditive après avoir reçu un coup sur son oreille gauche pendant sa seconde période d'emprisonnement; (2) son fils l'a appelée quelques semaines après l'audience devant la SPR pour l'informer que les autorités le cherchaient. La SAR n'a pas accepté l'affidavit, car la demanderesse devait savoir qu'elle avait subi une quelconque perte auditive lorsque l'audience a eu lieu et elle aurait pu porter cet élément de preuve à la connaissance de la SPR. Rien dans le dossier de la SPR n'indique que la demanderesse a soulevé cette question ou que sa perte auditive nécessitait la prise de mesures d'adaptation. Le deuxième élément de preuve ne respecte pas les critères énoncés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , car il avait peu de valeur probante. Cet élément de preuve révèle que les autorités sont à la recherche du fils de la demanderesse, et non de la demanderesse.
[16]
La SAR s'est appuyée sur les critères énoncés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> pour exclure également les trois autres éléments de preuve. La lettre en provenance de l'ami de la demanderesse a été rédigée après la décision de la SPR, mais ne respectait pas le critère relatif à la pertinence, car elle était vague et avait peu de valeur probante. L'article provenant d'Internet, qui portait sur l'amélioration de la communication en cas de perte auditive, n'était pas daté et revêtait un caractère général.
[17]
La SAR s'est ensuite penchée sur les éléments de preuve déposés au moyen d'une requête introduite en vertu de l'article 29 des
Règles de la Section d'appel des réfugiés
, DORS/2012-257 (les Règles): une lettre de son fils, Wondemu Yohannes, et les résultats de l'outil de repérage de cette lettre de Postes Canada. La lettre est datée du 15 décembre 2013 et la demanderesse l'a reçue le 14 janvier 2014. L'auteur s'informe de l'état de santé de la demanderesse, précise que l'époux de la demanderesse est en vie et qu'il s'est probablement joint au FLO, et affirme qu'il prévoit lui-même se rendre en Afrique du Sud pour demander l'asile. L'auteur ne prétend pas que quiconque est à la recherche de la demanderesse.
[18]
Selon la SAR, cette lettre n'apporte aucune nouvelle preuve qui justifierait la modification de la décision de la SPR. La demanderesse n'a pas non plus expliqué pourquoi elle n'avait pas été en mesure d'obtenir ou de présenter ce document plus tôt. Cette lettre est inadmissible selon l'article 29 des Règles. Par conséquent, il n'est pas nécessaire d'effectuer une analyse complète s'appuyant sur l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[19]
Le commissaire de la SAR a ensuite longuement analysé la question de la norme de contrôle. Il en est venu à la conclusion que la norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique dans le cadre de l'appel.
[20]
La demanderesse soutient que la SPR a commis une erreur en omettant de tenir compte d'éléments de preuve documentaire à l'appui de sa demande, y compris une lettre d'Ali Keder, un affidavit de Konjit Mitiku et des éléments de preuve objectifs sur la situation dans le pays. La SPR n'a également pas tenu compte d'un reçu de l'UDJ prouvant qu'elle avait fait un don à ce parti.
[21]
La SAR a rappelé que la SPR n'est pas tenue de faire état de chacun des éléments de preuve qui lui ont été présentés. Une erreur est susceptible d'un contrôle uniquement si la SPR omet de mentionner un élément de preuve important qui est directement pertinent pour une question au cœur de l'affaire.
[22]
La SAR a examiné les éléments de preuve mentionnés par la demanderesse et a conclu qu'il n'y a pas eu d'erreur en ce qui concerne la lettre d'Ali Keder, car celle-ci fait référence à l'arrestation de 2012. En revanche, les conclusions de la SPR relatives à la crédibilité se rapportaient uniquement à l'arrestation de 2013. Cette lettre ne portait pas sur une question fondamentale pour la décision.
[23]
La SAR a reconnu que la décision de la SPR ne faisait pas mention de certains éléments de preuve importants, à savoir l'affidavit dans lequel Konjit Mitiku déclare sous serment avoir rendu visite à la demanderesse lorsque celle-ci était emprisonnée, le reçu du don versé à l'UDJ et les éléments de preuve sur la situation dans le pays. La SAR a conclu qu'il était déraisonnable pour la SPR d'effectuer une analyse sans mentionner ces éléments de preuve dans ses motifs.
[24]
La SAR était en désaccord avec la demanderesse lorsque celle-ci soutenait que la SPR avait commis une erreur en omettant d'effectuer une analyse objective des risques fondée sur l'article 97. Selon la SAR, les termes employés par la SPR révèlent qu'elle a effectué une analyse fondée sur l'article 97. Le manque de crédibilité de la demanderesse a également entraîné le rejet de sa demande aux termes des articles 96 et 97. Il est bien établi en droit qu'une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité écarte souvent le besoin de prendre en considération l'article 97. Compte tenu des préoccupations de la SPR quant à la crédibilité de la demanderesse, l'analyse hâtive de l'article 97 était raisonnable.
[25]
La SAR s'est ensuite penchée sur la question de la crédibilité. Compte tenu des nombreuses préoccupations soulevées par la SPR et de la retenue dont elle doit faire preuve à l'égard des conclusions relatives à la crédibilité, la SAR a conclu que ces conclusions sont acceptables en application de la norme de la décision raisonnable. Par conséquent, la SAR a confirmé la décision de la SPR.

Questions en litige
[26]
La présente demande soulève trois questions:
1. La SAR a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son analyse de la norme de contrôle?
2. La SAR a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son analyse des nouveaux éléments de preuve?
3. La SAR a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son analyse de la crédibilité?
III.
Norme de contrôle
[27]
La jurisprudence de la Cour concernant la norme de contrôle que la SAR a choisi d'appliquer est divergente. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 34, le juge Phelan a choisi la norme de la décision correcte et a précisé que le choix de la norme de contrôle fait par la SAR est une question de droit qui présente un intérêt général pour le système juridique. D'autres juges, qui ont adopté un point de vue différent, ont préféré la norme de la décision raisonnable et ont considéré qu'il s'agit d'une question juridique relevant de l'expertise du décideur: voir par exemple
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[28]
Je juge qu'il n'est pas nécessaire de me prononcer sur cette question en l'espèce. Comme la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> a été portée en appel, la Cour d'appel aura bientôt l'occasion de répondre à cette question. Quoi qu'il en soit, la norme de contrôle que doit appliquer la Cour à l'égard de décision la SAR n'est pas en cause, car la décision de la SAR d'appliquer une norme de contrôle déférente était à la fois correcte et raisonnable, comme je l'explique ci-dessous.
[29]
La norme de contrôle applicable à la deuxième question en litige est celle de la décision raisonnable, car la SAR doit appliquer sa loi constitutive et ses règlements aux faits qui lui sont présentés:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 54.
[30]
La SAR n'a pas tiré de conclusions indépendantes sur la crédibilité; elle a plutôt confirmé celles de la SPR à ce sujet. Comme la SAR devait examiner les faits à la lumière de sa loi constitutive, la norme de contrôle que doit appliquer la Cour à l'égard de la décision de SAR est encore celle de la décision raisonnable.
IV.
Analyse
A.
La SAR a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son analyse de la norme de contrôle?
[31]
La SAR n'a commis aucune erreur lorsqu'elle a fait preuve de retenue à l'égard des conclusions de la SPR sur des questions de fait et de crédibilité, malgré la controverse actuelle soulevée devant la Cour sur la norme de contrôle appropriée.
[32]
La Cour a renvoyé des décisions dans lesquelles la SAR avait fait preuve de retenue à l'égard de différentes questions. Par exemple, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la SAR a fait preuve de retenue à l'égard de l'analyse de la SPR sur la protection de l'État. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la SAR a fait preuve de retenue à l'égard des conclusions de la SPR sur la vraisemblance et sur le risque généralisé; ce dernier était une question mixte de fait et de droit.
[33]
Dans ces décisions, la Cour a interprété le régime de la SAR soit comme une procédure hybride ressemblant en quelque sorte à un appel
de novo
, soit comme un véritable appel ressemblant à ceux tranchés par les cours d'appel. Toutefois, chacun de ces courants jurisprudentiels reconnait le principe selon lequel il faut faire preuve de retenue à l'égard des conclusions relatives à la crédibilité, car la SAR ne tient généralement pas d'audience et qu'elle est par conséquent désavantagée par rapport à la SPR.
[34]
Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Phelan a affirmé qu'il estimait que le régime de la SAR fonctionnait comme un appel
de novo
. Il a tout de même reconnu la nécessité de faire preuve de retenue en ce qui a trait aux questions de crédibilité (au paragraphe 37). En outre, il a affirmé que la norme de contrôle applicable à la crédibilité n'est pas celle de l'« erreur manifeste et dominante » (aux paragraphes 54 et 55). Selon mon interprétation, il a implicitement appuyé la norme de la décision raisonnable, car il s'agit de la norme de déférence la plus fréquente en droit.
[35]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge Roy, qui s'est appuyé sur le processus analytique énoncé dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  était d'avis que la SAR fonctionne comme une cour d'appel. Il a affirmé que, lorsque des conclusions relatives à la crédibilité sont en cause, la SAR devrait appliquer la norme de contrôle de l'« erreur manifeste et dominante ».
[36]
Ce débat est largement théorique parce qu'aucune partie n'est en accord avec la demanderesse lorsque celle-ci affirme que la norme de la décision correcte s'applique. Si la SAR a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a indiqué que la norme déférente qu'elle avait choisie était celle du « caractère raisonnable », et non celle de l'« erreur manifeste et dominante », cette erreur n'est pas en cause.
[37]
Peu après l'audience, la demanderesse a porté à mon attention une décision rendue récemment par mon collègue, le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Dans ses observations incidentes formulées aux paragraphes 30 à 34, le juge Noël émettait des doutes quant à l'idée de permettre à la SAR de faire preuve de retenue à l'égard des conclusions de la SPR, même en ce qui concerne des questions relatives à la crédibilité. Je souscris à l'avis du juge Noël à savoir que le rôle des tribunaux d'appel ne consiste pas à exercer un contrôle judiciaire et je déplore toute déclaration de la SAR en ce sens. Cependant, sans vouloir aucunement lui manquer de respect, je ne crois pas que la SAR devrait systématiquement réévaluer la crédibilité dans le cadre des appels dont elle est saisie.
[38]
Il est difficile de comprendre comment un tribunal administratif pourrait appliquer la norme de la décision correcte aux conclusions relatives à la crédibilité dans le cadre d'un appel sur dossier. La SPR dispose d'un avantage par rapport à la SAR, car elle peut observer le demandeur en personne, tandis que la SAR a cette possibilité uniquement dans des circonstances inhabituelles. Si la SAR ne devait faire preuve d'aucune retenue à l'égard des conclusions de la SPR sur des questions que celle-ci est la mieux placée pour évaluer, le régime législatif comporterait des chevauchements inutiles. La SPR n'aurait aucune raison d'être. Ceci appelle la retenue de la SAR à l'égard des conclusions de la SPR sur des questions relatives à la crédibilité.
[39]
Quoi qu'il en soit, je conclus que la SAR a effectué sa propre évaluation de la crédibilité de la demanderesse en s'appuyant sur l'analyse très approfondie de la SPR quant aux incohérences que celle-ci a relevées entre le FDA et le témoignage de la demanderesse.
B.
La SAR a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son analyse des nouveaux éléments de preuve?
[40]
La SAR avait le droit d'utiliser les facteurs énoncés dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , établis pour les ERAR, lorsqu'elle a appliqué la règle régissant les nouveaux éléments de preuve énoncée au paragraphe 110(4). Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge Shore s'est exprimé en ces termes:
Considérant la pénurie de jurisprudence interprétant le paragraphe 110(4) et vu la similitude essentielle des dispositions en question, la Cour ne considère pas qu'il était déraisonnable de la SAR de référer aux facteurs énoncés dans l'affaire Raza, ci-dessus, pour analyser l'admissibilité de nouveaux éléments de preuve. Cette jurisprudence a établi un sens juridique d'application générale aux mots « preuve nouvelle », qui, à l'avis de la Cour, s'harmonise avec l'intention claire du législateur quant au paragraphe 110(4) d'obliger la SAR de réviser la décision de la SPR telle quelle, à moins que des preuves nouvelles, crédibles et pertinentes soient survenues depuis le rejet,
qui auraient pu conduire la SPR à statuer autrement si elle en avait eu connaissance
.
[Souligné dans l'original.]
[41]
De plus, la SAR s'est appuyée sur les termes exprès du paragraphe 29(4) des Règles pour exclure les nouveaux éléments de preuve présentés après le dépôt du dossier d'appel. Cette règle énumère explicitement certains facteurs de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[42]
Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 37, le juge Simon Noël exprime ses réserves quant à l'opportunité d'appliquer l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> dans le contexte de la SAR. Il se reporte à l'analyse effectuée par la juge Gagné dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 58. Là encore, sans vouloir lui manquer de respect, je suis en désaccord. Comme l'a souligné le juge Shore dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le libellé du paragraphe 110(4) et de l'alinéa 113
a
) est presque identique. Compte tenu de la structure générale de ces dispositions, je n'accorde aucune importance à la légère différence dans la version française (« qu'elle n'aurait pas normalement présentés » comparativement à « qu'il n'était pas raisonnable, dans les circonstances, de s'attendre à ce qu'il les ait présentés »).
[43]
Lorsqu'elle interprète l'intention du législateur, la Cour doit accorder la priorité au texte écrit en l'absence de toute ambiguïté lexicale. Ni les opinions de la Cour sur les meilleures politiques ni des passages tirés du hansard ne peuvent l'emporter sur le texte de la loi. À mon avis, le législateur voulait que, dans ces deux dispositions législatives, le même critère juridique soit consacré. Si le législateur avait eu l'intention d'établir des règles d'admissibilité plus souples dans le cadre des appels interjetés devant la SAR, il n'aurait pas reproduit le libellé restrictif régissant les ERAR.
[44]
Je conclus que la SAR a raisonnablement exclu les éléments de preuve en cause pour les motifs qu'elle a exposés. La demanderesse a insisté sur le fait que la SAR avait exclu la lettre de son fils en application du paragraphe 29(4) des Règles. J'estime que la SAR a raisonnablement exclu cette lettre, car elle était peu pertinente et avait peu de valeur probante. Elle a également fait part de ses préoccupations raisonnables quant à la possibilité que cette lettre ait pu être disponible plus tôt.
C.
La SAR a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son analyse de la crédibilité?
[45]
La SPR a appuyé ses nombreuses conclusions défavorables quant à la crédibilité sur des incohérences et des contradictions importantes entre l'exposé circonstancié contenu dans le formulaire FDA de la demanderesse et le témoignage de vive voix de cette dernière. La demanderesse n'a pas contesté ces conclusions au cours de son appel devant la SAR ni dans le cadre de la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire. Elle insiste plutôt sur le fait que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte d'éléments de preuve documentaire corroborant ses allégations et établissant les risques auxquels elle est exposée en Éthiopie.
[46]
La SAR a en quelque sorte étayé l'argument de la demanderesse lorsqu'elle a déclaré que la SPR avait agi déraisonnablement en omettant de mentionner ces éléments de preuve. Au final, la SAR a tout de même maintenu les conclusions de la SPR, car les conclusions de celle-ci relatives à la crédibilité étaient raisonnables compte tenu du dossier. La SAR n'a commis aucune erreur susceptible de contrôle à cet égard.
[47]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge de Montigny a conclu que la SPR avait commis une erreur dans son analyse de la protection de l'État, mais a tout de même conclu que les demandeurs manquaient de crédibilité. Il a rejeté la demande de contrôle judiciaire pour les motifs suivants, énoncés au paragraphe 45:
[...] Bien que les demandeurs aient démontré une erreur en ce qui a trait à l'évaluation de la protection de l'État, elle est sans conséquence parce qu'ils n'ont pas réussi à établir qu'ils ont besoin de cette protection. Le commissaire a conclu que leur récit n'était pas crédible et, par conséquent, que leur crainte de persécution n'était pas subjectivement fondée. Par conséquent, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être rejetée.
[48]
Il en va de même en l'espèce. La SAR a implicitement et raisonnablement conclu que l'erreur de la SPR ne revêtait pas d'importance compte tenu du manque de crédibilité de la demanderesse. Il était raisonnable pour la SAR de conclure que les éléments de preuve non mentionnés n'auraient pas permis de corriger les incohérences et les contradictions importantes relevées dans le témoignage de la demanderesse. Bien que l'avocat de la demanderesse ait soutenu avec vigueur à l'audience que la SAR aurait dû attribuer un certain poids à l'affidavit de Konjit Mikitu, qui aurait rendu visite à la demanderesse lorsque celle-ci était emprisonnée, j'estime que le défaut d'accorder du poids à cet élément de preuve n'entraîne pas une erreur susceptible d'un contrôle judiciaire. En ce qui concerne l'examen du caractère raisonnable, il n'importe pas de savoir si la Cour aurait accordé un poids différent à un élément de preuve précis, car le rôle de la Cour
ne
consiste
pas
à [traduction] « se forger son propre point de vue, à l'affirmer et à l'appliquer »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[49]
L'avocat de la demanderesse a également reproché à la SAR d'avoir souscrit sommairement aux conclusions de la SPR quant à la crédibilité au lieu d'expliquer en profondeur les motifs pour lesquels elles étaient raisonnables. À mon avis, il tente d'imposer une exigence
pro forma
inutile à la SAR afin que celle-ci répète en termes différents ce que la SPR a expliqué avec beaucoup de conviction dans sa décision. La déclaration de la SPR quant aux incohérences est éloquente.
[50]
De même, il était raisonnable que la SAR appuie l'analyse de l'article 97 effectuée par la SPR. Dans ses motifs, la SAR a correctement cité la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à l'appui de la proposition selon laquelle une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité peut rendre inutile l'examen de l'article 97. Je souhaite également souligner les directives fournies par la Cour d'appel dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[...] Lorsque la Commission tire une conclusion générale selon laquelle le demandeur manque de crédibilité, cette conclusion suffit pour rejeter la demande, à moins que le dossier ne comporte une preuve documentaire indépendante et crédible permettant d'étayer une décision favorable au demandeur. C'est au demandeur qu'il incombe de démontrer que cette preuve existe.
[51]
En l'espèce, la demanderesse n'a pas fourni d'élément de preuve crédible et indépendant prouvant qu'elle est confrontée à un risque en Éthiopie. Les éléments de preuve documentaire objectifs décrivent les risques auxquels sont exposés les dissidents politiques et leur famille. La SPR a mis en doute la crédibilité de la demanderesse et n'a pas cru que son époux ou elle étaient des dissidents politiques. Par conséquent, la demanderesse n'est pas exposée à un risque en raison de son profil. La SAR n'a pas commis d'erreur en confirmant l'analyse de la SPR à cet égard.
[52]
La demande est rejetée. Les parties n'ont proposé aucune question aux fins de certification et aucune question ne sera certifiée.

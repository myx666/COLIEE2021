 Summary: 
 
 This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2014] F.T.R. TBEd. JA.030.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] 
   
 Roy, J. 
  [Translation]: The Crown is appealing the decision of Prothonotary Morneau of December 11, who accepted the production of a supplementary affidavit in an application for judicial review of a decision of a law enforcement officer refusing an administrative stay of a removal order.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  This stems from an application for a so-called [translation] "administrative" stay of a removal order that was to take place on September 22, under the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 (the Act). The state of the applicant's health and the best interests of the child were raised. The removal is to St-Vincent and the Grenadines.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The application for a stay was dismissed on September 10. A new application was presented on September 17. This application added the fear of violence in support of the requested stay. The administrative stay was no further granted on September 19.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  The story is complicated because of the fact that the respondent had approached this Court on September 13 to obtain the judicial review of the first rejection of the administrative stay on September 10. The judicial stay was to be heard on September 20. The respondent appropriately warned this Court's judge of the second rejection of the administrative stay on September 18.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Satisfied that the test in this matter was met, that there was a serious question regarding the administrative refusal, that the balance of convenience was in favour of the respondent and that the respondent would suffer irreparable harm ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), a judge of this Court granted the judicial stay.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The judge also ordered [translation] "that the applicant must introduce a motion to amend her application for leave so that she may refer to the decision made on September 18, 2013, rather than the decision made on September 10, 2013", which was done. On October 28, the judge allowed the motion and granted two days to file the application for leave and for judicial review of the rejection of the administrative stay of September 13, 2013. His order was amended on October 30 to correct a minor error.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Under the  
 Federal Courts Rules 
 , SOR/98-106, the applicant's record had to be completed on November 29. However, on November 26, the applicant brought a motion to allow the filing of new evidence. The new evidence consisted in a letter from a doctor; clearly, this new evidence regarding the applicant's medical situation was subsequent to the decision for which the judicial review is requested. The applicant also sought a suspension of deadlines to complete the record until the decision on her motion for leave of new evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The respondent opposed the motion, claiming that it was frivolous, vexatious and dilatory. To the great frustration of the respondent, the Prothonotary allowed the motion. The affidavit presenting the doctor's note and the motion had to be filed at the latest on December 18. As to the deadlines for subsequent events, it was ordered that they would [translation] "commence on December 12, 2013".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  This is the Prothonotary's decision that the respondent is appealing under section 51. It complains that new evidence is allowed and that the new facts are presented by letter instead of by affidavit, relying on paragraph 10(2)( 
 d 
 ) of the  
 Federal Court Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules 
 , SOR/93-22.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  This matter may be disposed of by deciding the issue of new evidence. The issue before this Court is to determine whether the Prothonotary was right to allow evidence subsequent to the decision of which the applicant is seeking judicial review. The test to be applied is well established.  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , reads as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 94 I also agree with the Chief Justice in part as to the standard of review to be applied by a motions judge to a discretionary decision [page463] of a prothonotary. Following in particular Lord Wright in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (H.L.) at page 484, and Lacourcière J.A. in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Div. Ct.), discretionary orders of prothonotaries ought not to be disturbed on appeal to a judge unless:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) they are clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion by the prothonotary was based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts, or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) they raise questions vital to the final issue of the case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (see also  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  As to the issue of using affidavits, I have nothing to add to the Prothonotary's decision; it allows for the filing of an affidavit with an exhibit. If the new evidence is otherwise admissible, it has not been demonstrated that the decision was clearly incorrect, based upon a wrong principle and certainly does not relate to a question that is vital to the determination of this matter, the test in question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  As regards the admission into evidence of a letter from a doctor prepared over two months after the decision for which the application for judicial review is being made, the Prothonotary's decision was made in a cursory manner. The applicant argues essentially that this evidence is necessary because of the progressive nature of this medical situation. It is not clear how the applicant claims to be able to use this letter and how it relates to the progression of the medical situation. At the hearing, the question was asked directly and counsel was not able to justify this claim. Further, the applicant made statements that were not always consistent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The applicant first stated that she [translation] "never alleged that she was unable to travel" (para 40 of the applicant's record). She then responded to the respondent's argument claiming that the new evidence adds a new element that was not present in the decision of September 18. But in the same paragraph, the applicant stated the opposite. What is more, in subsection 41, the applicant said succinctly that [translation] "the inability to travel is at the heart of this application and it is therefore not a new argument, but a result of the applicant's medical condition".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  The applicant said at paragraph 25 of her memorandum that she [translation] "alleged that the failure to produce the progression of her medical condition could result in a jurisdictional error relating to a decision on the administrative stay of the applicant's removal on the basis of her past, present or future medical condition, which is at the heart of this case". However, the letter that the applicant wanted to file does not deal with the progression of the illness. Besides this sentence being difficult to understand and without any authority to support it, the applicant states at paragraph 34, that she does not want to [translation] "ask the Court to weigh new evidence, but rather to conduct the judicial review of the removal decision while informing this honourable Court of the applicant's medical condition".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  This confusion is unfortunate and it was not resolved in the hearing. It seems to be based on a flawed understanding of what a judicial review consists of.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  The applicant seems to want this Court to evaluate the applicant's medical situation. However, the judicial review is of the decision to refuse a stay on September 18. This decision, by definition, is only concerned with the evidence on which the decision to refuse the stay was based. Therefore, different and new evidence may not be useful to the assessment of a judicial review of an administrative decision except when the assessment relates to procedural fairness. For example, if an allegation of fraud had been made, evidence by affidavit would be allowed to establish it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Judicial review is not a remedy that allows a superior court to follow the progress of a file. Exactly the opposite is at issue. The Court reviewed the decision as rendered based on the evidence before the decision-maker at that time. It then applied the appropriate standard of review, which is more often than not the standard of reasonableness ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , on questions of fact where legal and factual issues cannot be easily separated).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  It seems difficult to imagine how a superior court could review the legality of a decision based on a standard of review while taking into account new facts that were not before the decision-maker; this transforms the judicial review into a  
 de novo 
  review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  The applicant was never able to clearly say how, during judicial review, evidence subsequent to the decision that is the subject of review could have some relevance to the subject of the matter, which is the review of a decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  If there are instances where new evidence could be accepted and they are as I noted earlier, the applicant did not demonstrate it in this case (see, among others  
 Judicial Review of Administrative Actions in Canada 
 , Brown and Evans, loose-leaf, chapter 6 and, in particular, numbers 6: 5300 et seq, with the abundance of case law cited). This is a simple case where the law enforcement officer exercised his otherwise very narrow discretion (section 48 of the Act) by dismissing an application for a stay of removal on the basis of the evidence presented at that time. Because the applicant met the tripartite test described in paragraph 5 of these reasons, the refusal to grant her the stay was suspended so that the judicial review of the refusal of the administrative stay could be heard. That is where we are. It only remains to review the legality of the refusal of the administrative stay of September 18, 2013, and not to seek whether the applicant might receive an administrative stay if the facts were different. This Court does not have the jurisdiction to decide whether an administrative stay should be granted. The Act confers this discretion on someone else, i.e. on the Minister, the respondent. This Court can only review the legality of the decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  I have read the letter that the applicant would like to file into evidence on judicial review. In my view, as I noted, the letter does not deal with the progression of the applicant's illness but is rather a description of its severity. The letter concludes "... I believe that deportation poses a serious danger to both her short and long term health". The letter does not provide any explanation for this conclusion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  The rather succinct decision of the Prothonotary seems to have been influenced by the written submissions of the applicant. I have read them. I did not detect in them the reasons allowing to override the principle that judicial review does not give rise to receiving new evidence. The very nature of the action simply does not allow for it. Indeed, the Prothonotary referred in particular to certain paragraphs of the submissions made by the applicant. Further, the letter was being discussed as describing the progression of the illness. That is not the case. In my view, there are two possibilities. Either the applicant seeks to add evidence and, thus, is breaching a fundamental rule, or she seeks to reach another goal and therefore the relevance of this evidence must be established, which was not done.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  In my view, it is a clear case of an  
 ex post facto 
  addition to the record. This passage from  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  shows very well the attempt made by the applicant and why it must be rejected:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 13 The principle of so-called "granularity" is not a recognised basis to add to a record even if the additional material does only amplify, inform, clarify or explain the evidence before a tribunal. The record is the record. Additional material changes the record. Admitting additional material compromises the process of judicial review. To admit additional material in this case would be to prevent a proper judicial review of the decisions of the Tribunal. That review should be a review of the decisions of the Tribunal based on the evidence before it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  Finally, I add that the probative value of this letter, when read closely, is very weak and I doubt that it would have had any impact whatsoever. The applicant argued at the hearing that she wanted to use this letter to show that this doctor follows this patient, which presumably would increase her credibility. Medical opinions are part of the judicial review record and they speak for themselves. Thus, we can understand why the Prothonotary would have left it in the record since its relative weight is weak. Further, the principle is clear and it deserves to be respected. It is for that sole reason that the appeal is allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  The result is that the appeal must be granted. The letter of November 26, 2013, will not be put on record. The usual deadline to complete the record before this Court (service and filing of the applicant's record) will commence on January 15, 2014.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Le juge Roy 
 : La Couronne porte en appel la décision de monsieur le protonotaire, Me Morneau, du 11 décembre dernier qui a accepté la production d'un affidavit supplémentaire dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire d'une décision d'un agent d'exécution de la loi qui a refusé un sursis administratif à une mesure de renvoi.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Le tout procède d'une demande de sursis dit « administratif » d'un renvoi qui devait avoir lieu le 22 septembre dernier, le tout en vertu de la  
 Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés 
 , LC 2001, ch 27 (la Loi). Étaient invoqués la situation de santé de la défenderesse et l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant. Le renvoi est vers St-Vincent et les Grenadines.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  La demande de sursis a été rejetée le 10 septembre. Une nouvelle demande était présentée le 17 septembre. Cette demande ajoutait la crainte de violence à l'appui du sursis demandé. Le sursis administratif n'était pas davantage accordé le 19 septembre.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  Le narratif est compliqué du fait que le défendeur s'était adressé à cette Cour dès le 13 septembre pour obtenir le contrôle judiciaire du premier refus de sursis administratif, le 10 septembre. Le sursis judiciaire devait être entendu le 20 septembre. La défenderesse a, comme il se doit, prévenu le juge de cette Cour du deuxième refus de sursis administratif du 18 septembre.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Satisfait que le test en cette matière était rencontré, à savoir qu'une question sérieuse se posait quant au refus administratif, que la balance des inconvénients favorisait la défenderesse et que la défenderesse en subirait un préjudice irréparable ( 
 RJR-Macdonald inc. c Canada (Procureur général) 
 , [1994] 1 RCS 311), un juge de cette Cour accordait le sursis judiciaire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  Le juge de cette Cour ordonnait aussi « que la partie demanderesse devra introduire une requête pour modifier sa demande d'autorisation afin de faire référence à la décision rendue le 18 septembre 2013, plutôt qu'à la décision rendue le 10 septembre 2013 ». Ce qui fut fait. Le 28 octobre, le juge de la Cour faisait droit à la requête et accordait un délai de 2 jours pour déposer la demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire du refus de sursis administratif du 13 septembre 2013. Son ordonnance était amendée le 30 octobre pour corriger une erreur mineure.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Aux termes des  
 Règles des Cours fédérales 
 , DORS/98-106, le dossier du demandeur devait être complété le 29 novembre. Cependant, le 26 novembre, la demanderesse présentait une requête pour permettre le dépôt d'une nouvelle preuve. La nouvelle preuve consistait en une lettre provenant d'un médecin; de toute évidence, cette nouvelle preuve au sujet de la situation médicale de la demanderesse était postérieure à la décision dont le contrôle judiciaire est demandé. La demanderesse cherchait aussi à obtenir la suspension des délais pour parfaire le dossier jusqu'à la décision sur sa requête pour l'autorisation d'une nouvelle preuve.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  Le défendeur s'est opposé à la requête, prétendant qu'elle était frivole, vexatoire et dilatoire. Au grand dam du défendeur, le Protonotaire a fait droit à la requête. L'affidavit présentant la lettre du médecin et celle-ci devaient être déposés au plus tard le 18 décembre. Quant aux délais pour la suite des choses, il était ordonné qu'ils « commenceront à courir à compter du 12 décembre 2013 ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  C'est de cette décision du Protonotaire dont le défendeur appelle en vertu de la règle 51. Il se plaint qu'une nouvelle preuve soit permise et que des faits nouveaux soient présentés par lettre plutôt que par affidavit, invoquant l'alinéa 10(2) 
 d) 
  des  
 Règles des Cours fédérales 
   
 en matière d'immigration et de protection des réfugiés 
 , DORS/93-22.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  On peut disposer de cette affaire en décidant de la question de la preuve nouvelle. La question devant cette Cour est de déterminer si le Protonotaire a eu raison de permettre une preuve postérieure à la décision dont contrôle judiciaire a été demandé. Le test à appliquer est bien connu.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , on lit:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 94 Je souscris aussi en partie à l'avis du juge en chef au sujet de la norme de révision à appliquer par le juge des requêtes à l'égard des décisions discrétionnaires [page463] de protonotaire. Selon en particulier la conclusion tirée par lord  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (H.L.) à la page 484, et par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C. div.), le juge saisi de l'appel contre l'ordonnance discrétionnaire d'un protonotaire ne doit pas intervenir sauf dans les deux cas suivants:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 a) l'ordonnance est entachée d'erreur flagrante, en ce sens que le protonotaire a exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire en vertu d'un mauvais principe ou d'une mauvaise appréciation des faits,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 b) l'ordonnance porte sur des questions ayant une influence déterminante sur l'issue du principal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (voir aussi  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  Quant à la question de l'utilisation d'affidavits, je n'ai rien à ajouter à la décision du Protonotaire; elle permet le dépôt d'un affidavit avec une pièce. Si la nouvelle preuve est par ailleurs admissible, il n'a pas été démontré que la décision était clairement erronée en vertu d'un mauvais principe et elle ne porte certes pas sur une question vitale à la disposition de cette affaire, le test dont il est question en la matière.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  En ce qui concerne l'admission en preuve d'une lettre d'un médecin préparée plus de deux mois après la décision dont on demande le contrôle judiciaire, la décision du Protonotaire est lapidaire. La demanderesse argumente essentiellement que cette preuve est nécessaire à cause de la nature évolutive de cette situation médicale. Il n'est pas clair quel usage la demanderesse prétend pouvoir faire de cette lettre et en quoi elle porterait sur la nature évolutive de la maladie. À l'audience, la question a été posée directement et l'avocat n'a pu justifier cette prétention. D'ailleurs, la demanderesse fait des affirmations pas toujours concordantes.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  Ainsi, la demanderesse déclare d'abord n'avoir « jamais allégué l'incapacité à voyager » (para 40 du mémoire de la demanderesse). Elle répond alors à l'argument de la défenderesse qui prétend que la nouvelle preuve ajoute un nouvel élément non présent à la décision du 18 septembre. Mais dans le même paragraphe, la demanderesse déclare le contraire. Qui plus est, au paragraphe 41, la demanderesse dit de façon plutôt elliptique que « l'incapacité de voyager est au coeur de la présente demande et il ne s'agit donc pas d'un nouvel argument mais d'une conséquence de la condition médicale de la partie demanderesse ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  La demanderesse dit au paragraphe 25 de son mémoire avoir « allégué que le défaut de produire l'évolution médicale pourrait donner lieu à une erreur juridictionnelle portant sur une décision rendue sur le sursis administratif du renvoi de la demanderesse sur la base de sa condition médicale passée, présente ou future, ce qui est au cœur du présent litige ». Quoi qu'il en soit, la lettre que la demanderesse voulait déposer ne traite pas de l'évolution de la maladie. Outre que cette phrase soit difficile à comprendre et sans autre autorité à son soutien, la demanderesse dit vouloir, au paragraphe 34, ne pas vouloir « inviter la Cour à soupeser de nouveaux éléments de preuve, mais plutôt d'effectuer le contrôle judiciaire de la décision de renvoi, tout en informant cette honorable Cour de l'état médical de la demanderesse; ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Cette confusion est malheureuse et elle ne s'est pas résolue à l'audience. Elle me semble procéder de la compréhension défectueuse de ce en quoi consiste le contrôle judiciaire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  La demanderesse semble souhaiter que cette Cour évalue la situation médicale de la demanderesse. Pourtant, le contrôle judiciaire l'est de la décision de refuser un sursis le 18 septembre dernier. Cette décision, par définition, n'est concernée que par la preuve à partir de laquelle la décision de refuser le sursis a été prise. Une preuve différente, nouvelle, ne peut donc pas être utile à l'examen par contrôle judiciaire d'une décision administrative sauf si l'examen portait sur l'équité procédurale. Par exemple, si fraude avait été alléguée, preuve par affidavit serait permise pour l'établir.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Le contrôle judiciaire n'est pas un recours qui permet à une cour supérieure de suivre l'évolution d'un dossier. C'est exactement l'inverse dont il est question. La Cour examine la décision telle que rendue en fonction de la preuve qui était devant le décideur à ce temps. Elle y applique alors la norme de contrôle appropriée, plus souvent qu'autrement la norme de la raisonnabilité ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  sur les questions de fait où les questions de faits et de droit ne peuvent aisément être dissociées).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  Il me semble difficile de concevoir comment une cour supérieure pourrait contrôler la légalité d'une décision sur la base d'une norme de contrôle tout en prenant en compte des faits nouveaux qui n'étaient pas devant le décideur; cela transforme le contrôle judiciaire en un examen de novo.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  La demanderesse n'a jamais été en mesure de dire clairement en quoi, lors d'un contrôle judiciaire, une preuve postérieure à la décision dont contrôle est demandé pourrait avoir quelle que pertinence face à l'objet du recours qui est le contrôle d'une décision prise.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  S'il est des cas où une nouvelle preuve pourrait être admise, et il en est tel que je l'ai souligné, la demanderesse n'en a aucunement fait la démonstration en l'espèce (voir, entre autres, « Judicial Review of Administrative Actions in Canada », Brown et Evans, feuilles mobiles, chapitre 6 et en particulier les numéros 6:5300 et suivants, avec l'abondante jurisprudence citée). Il s'agit d'un cas simple où l'agent d'exécution de la loi a exercé sa discrétion par ailleurs très étroite (article 48 de la Loi) en refusant une demande de sursis de renvoi sur la base de la preuve alors présentée. Parce que la demanderesse a satisfait au test en trois parties décrit au paragraphe 5 des présents motifs, le refus d'accorder le sursis a lui-même été suspendu pour que le contrôle judiciaire du refus de sursis administratif puisse être entendu. Nous en sommes là. Il ne reste plus qu'à contrôler la légalité du refus de sursis administratif du 18 septembre 2013, et non de chercher à voir si la demanderesse pourrait recevoir un sursis administratif si les faits étaient différents. Cette Cour n'a pas la juridiction de décider si un sursis administratif devrait être accordé. La Loi donne cette discrétion à quelqu'un d'autre, c'est-à-dire au Ministre, le défendeur. Cette Cour ne peut que contrôler la légalité de la décision prise.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  J'ai pris connaissance de la lettre que la demanderesse souhaiterait produire en preuve au stade du contrôle judiciaire. À mon avis, comme je l'ai noté, la lettre ne traite pas de l'évolution de la maladie de la demanderesse mais est plutôt une description de sa sévérité. La lettre conclut que « ... I believe that deportation poses a serious danger to both her short and long term health ». La lettre ne fournit aucune explication pour cette conclusion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  La décision plutôt lapidaire du Protonotaire semble avoir été influencée par les représentations écrites de la demanderesse. Je les ai consultées. Je n'ai pas y déceler les raisons permettant de passer outre au principe voulant que le contrôle judiciaire ne donne pas ouverture à la réception de preuve nouvelle. La nature même du recours ne s'y prête tout simplement pas. De fait, le Protonotaire a référé en particulier à certains paragraphes des représentations faites par la demanderesse. Or, on y parlait alors de la lettre comme traitant de l'évolution de la maladie. Tel n'est pas le cas. C'est, à mon avis, de deux choses l'une. Ou bien la demanderesse cherche à ajouter de la preuve, et alors on contrevient à une règle fondamentale, ou bien elle cherche à atteindre un autre but et alors la pertinence de cette preuve doit être établie, ce qui n'a pas été fait.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Il s'agit là, à mon avis, d'un cas clair d'ajout ex post facto au dossier. Ce passage tiré de  
 Canwood International inc c Bork 
 , 2012 BCSC 578, illustre très bien la tentative faite par la demanderesse et pourquoi elle doit être rejetée:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 13 The principle of so-called "granularity" is not a recognised basis to add to a record even if the additional material does only amplify, inform, clarify or explain the evidence before a tribunal. The record is the record. Additional material changes the record. Admitting additional material compromises the process of judicial review. To admit additional material in this case would be to prevent a proper judicial review of the decisions of the Tribunal. That review should be a review of the decisions of the Tribunal based on the evidence before it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  J'ajoute enfin que la valeur probante de cette lettre, lorsqu'elle est lue attentivement, est très faible et que je doute qu'elle aurait eu quelque impact que ce soit. La demanderesse a plaidé à l'audience vouloir utiliser cette lettre pour démontrer que ce médecin suit cette patiente ce qui, présumément, améliorait sa crédibilité. Les opinions médicales font partie du dossier en contrôle judiciaire et elles parlent d'elles-mêmes. On peut ainsi comprendre pourquoi le Protonotaire l'aurait laissée au dossier puisque son poids relatif est faible. Par ailleurs, le principe est clair et il mérite qu'il soit respecté. C'est pour cette seule raison que l'appel est accordé.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Il en résulte que l'appel doit être accordé. La lettre du 26 novembre 2013 ne sera pas versée au dossier. Le délai normal pour parfaire le dossier devant cette Cour (signification et dépôt du dossier de la demanderesse) commencera à compter du 15 janvier 2014.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

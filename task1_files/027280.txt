Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Campbell, J.
: The Applicant, a citizen of Afghanistan, claims refugee protection in Canada because of subjective and objective fear that, should he be required to return to Afghanistan, he will suffer more than a mere possibility of persecution under s. 96 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the
IRPA
], or probable risk under s. 97 at the hands of the Taliban.
[2]
The present Application concerns the rejection of the Applicant's claim by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (RPD) on the core issue of the Applicant's credibility with respect to his evidence of the reason for claiming protection.
[3]
The RPD's cardinal conclusion that dominates the rejection of the Applicant's claim is that it has no basis in truth because the Applicant is a liar (Decision, paragraph 81). This conclusion is primarily based on the RPD's finding that there is a purported difference between the Applicant's statements at the Port of Entry (POE) and his statements in his Basis of Claim (BOC) completed two weeks after arrival. For the reasons provided below, I find that the RPD's conclusion was reached in disregard of the law on the making of credibility findings.
[4]
However, first, a determination is required as to whether the hearing before the RPD was unfairly conducted.
I. Hearing Conducted in Breach of the Duty of Fairness
[5]
At the opening of the hearing before the RPD, a serious complication arose on the issue of the interpretation of the Applicant's evidence. The Applicant is a Dari speaking individual from Afghanistan. In his BOC, the Applicant explained interpretation problems he experienced at the POE because he was given a Farsi speaking interpreter from Iran. As a result, for the hearing of his Application, the Applicant specifically requested an interpreter who speaks the Afghani dialect of Dari (see BOC, p. 9).
[6]
However, for the hearing the Applicant was provided with an interpreter from Iran, not Afghanistan, and, thus, Counsel for the Applicant made a formal objection to proceeding without the requested interpreter.
[7]
As a prelude to making the objection, Counsel for the Applicant referred to the communication problems the Applicant experienced during the POE interview:
COUNSEL: Right. And as specified in the Basis of Claim form, Mr. Mujadidi did request a Dari interpreter, specifically with Afghan, specifically from Afghanistan. At the border he had some problems understanding and being understood by the interpreter who was from Iran, was Farsi speaking. This is not questioning the competence of the interpreter we have today. It is not a question of that but there are different words that are used in Farsi and Dan and in my client's ---
(Tribunal Record, p. 389)
In addition, the Applicant explained that the accents between a Dari speaker from Afghanistan and a Dari speaker from Iran are different:
CLAIMANT: Some of the words from your side and my side could be different. That's why I just don't want to have any mistakes here.
PRESIDING MEMBER: But do you know they are different?
CLAIMANT: Yes, the accents from Afghanistan and Iran are different.
(Tribunal Record, p. 389)
[8]
Nevertheless, the RPD chose to proceed as follows:
PRESIDING MEMBER: So are you having any difficulty understanding [the interpreter]?
CLAIMANT: Not at the moment but the more we go ahead the problems may arise.
PRESIDING MEMBER: Okay. So, Mr. Interpreter, are you having any difficulty understand him?
INTERPRETER: No I don't.
PRESIDING MEMBER: Okay. So I would propose that we continue and if he has any difficulty he can say so right away.
COUNSEL: If we notice.
PRESIDING MEMBER: I wouldn't notice, I don't speak Dari.
COUNSEL: Nor do I.
PRESIDING MEMBER:
But the claimant wouldn't be able to understand something then he could say I don't understand. So far he seems to be okay. We just have to make sure the microphones are turned around.
[Emphasis added]
COUNSEL:
I just want to note for the record my objection to proceeding however I will give my client some instructions
.
PRESIDING MEMBER: Okay.
COUNSEL: Okay. If there is anything you don't understand please let us know as soon as you can, okay?
PRESIDING MEMBER: Now I know you know some English because you have responded before translation and have proceeded to respond in English. So it's important to wait for the translation because I want to make sure you fully understood what's being asked of you. And it's also important, it's in your interest to communicate in your Dari language because although you may feel inclined to respond in English you may not communicate or say something that you intend to say.
(Tribunal Record, pp. 389-390)
[9]
Thus, rather than acceding to Counsel for the Applicant's objection, the RPD chose to disregard it and to proceed by placing responsibility on the Applicant for the translation itself. In my opinion, this was manifestly unfair.
[10]
The record discloses that, as a result of the RPD's approach to the interpretation issue, there certainly were serious problems with the interpretation of the Applicant's evidence at the hearing, which resulted in highly contested findings of negative credibility made by the RPD. In the result, I find that the RPD's conduct of the hearing was in breach of the duty of fairness owed to the Applicant.
II. Law on Making Credibility Findings Disregarded
[11]
The Applicant entered Canada from the United States at Fort Erie. At the POE, the Applicant was interviewed to determine his eligibility to claim protection. In the decision rendered, the RPD sets out the questions asked and the answers given and continues to describe a purported difference between the Applicant's statements at the POE and his statements in his BOC as follows:
In the course of that interview at Fort Erie, the claimant declared to the CBSA that he did not want to return to Afghanistan because of the general situation in his country. That exchange went as follows:
Q: What was your purpose for travelling to the USA?
A: I came for a visit, because the situation in Afghanistan is not very good and the opportunity arised for me to come to Canada since I don't have anyone in the USA.
Q: Did you know you were going to come to Canada before you left Afghanistan?
A: No, I didn't have the intention to come to but then they told me the situation in Afghanistan is really bad and that's when I decided to come to Canada.
Q: What is the situation you are referring to?
A: There are bombings, there are kidnappings.
Q: Ok, but it has been like that all along, what changed once you arrived in the USA?
A: Before I left Afghanistan there was always stress going from the house to the office, but once I was in the USA there was an incident that broke a lot of glass in the offices, and I was informed I shouldn't come back, and there is a lot of talk about NATO going out of Afghanistan 2014 and if that happens things will get a lot worse with the Taliban. And for that reason from the youngest to the oldest there is a lot of fear for what is going to happen to Afghanistan.
The panel noted to the claimant that his BOC allegations are different; namely that he has been threatened by the Taliban and is being pursued by them. The panel gave the claimant the opportunity to clarify his inconsistent evidence. He stated:
Because when I was in Vive la Casa I started contacting the counsel. There was a counsel there. Her name was Alex. I talked to her and asked her if it is ok if I give all the information when I get to the border.
She mentioned that in my opinion don't give all the information there. She advised me that the more you talk about your case the more they question you
. [Emphasis added]
The panel asked him if there was anything else. He stated:
And the second point is that I was unable to sleep that night until the next morning because there is the car to transfer us to the borderline and so that I don't miss the interview, the car was supposed to be there on time to transfer me from the Viva la Casa to the borderline. And then I thought to myself if cannot tell them the whole thing in details then they are going to ask me for documents and I was not sure how long I was going to stay if they ask me for documentation and I thought to myself if I stay there, my family will be stressed out back home in Afghanistan and my aunt here in Canada. All together these were the reasons that I mentioned that story.
(Decision, paras. 16 - 18)
[12]
The Applicant's BOC narrative gives extensive detail on threats made against the Applicant by the Taliban in Afghanistan. The POE statements are not mentioned in the BOC (see Tribunal Record, pp. 26 - 31).
[13]
The conclusion reached by the RPD with respect to the difference between the Applicant's statements at the POE and his statements in his BOC is as follows:
A claimant is expected to pursue his claim diligently. Part and parcel of this diligence is making reasonable efforts to provide all information relevant to his claim. Indeed, he had every opportunity to do so. The reason why a claimant left his country is the very reason why a claimant seeks refugee protection, and
it is reasonable to expect this reason to be consistent throughout all the stages of the application process
. This applies even if this would somehow inconvenience the claimant by having him answer more questions or providing more information. The panel also notes that in this case the claimant's reasons for seeking Canada's protection in his POE notes are not contained in his BOC. Therefore, this is not a matter of him having failed to mention details,
but rather a matter of him failing to mention the very core of his claim, and him having mentioned allegations that he subsequently failed to
.
The claimant's inconsistent evidence as to the very basis of his refugee claim undermines his credibility
. His credibility is further diminished by the shifting explanations he provided for the inconsistent evidence. [Emphasis added] (Decision, paras. 30 and 31)
[14]
Thus, the RPD essentially found that that if the Applicant was telling the truth he would have given the same story at the POE and in the BOC. Put another way, it is implausible that the Applicant was telling the truth at the POE and in his BOC, because the statements in each are different.
[15]
The law with respect to credibility findings is well settled in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
With respect to making negative credibility findings in general, and implausibility findings in particular, Justice Muldoon in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
(C.A.) at 305, that when a refugee claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, a presumption is created that those allegations are true unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. But the tribunal does not apply the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> principle to this applicant, and repeatedly disregards his testimony, holding that much of it appears to it to be implausible. Additionally, the tribunal often substitutes its own version of events without evidence to support its conclusions.
7. A tribunal may make adverse findings of credibility based on the implausibility of an applicant's story provided the inferences drawn can be reasonably said to exist.
However, plausibility findings should be made only in the clearest of cases, i.e., if the facts as presented are outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected, or where the documentary evidence demonstrates that the events could not have happened in the manner asserted by the claimant
. A tribunal must be careful when rendering a decision based on a lack of plausibility because refugee claimants come from diverse cultures, and actions which appear implausible when judged from Canadian standards might be plausible when considered from within the claimant's milieu. [see L. Waldman, Immigration Law and Practice (Markham, ON: Butterworths, 1992) at 8.22]
[Emphasis added]
It is not difficult to understand that, to be fair to a person who swears to tell the truth, concrete reasons supported by cogent evidence must exist before the person is disbelieved. Let us be clear. To say that someone is not credible is to say that they are lying. Therefore, to be fair, a decision-maker must be able to articulate why he or she is suspicious of the sworn testimony, and, unless this can be done, suspicion cannot be applied in reaching a conclusion. The benefit of any unsupported doubt must go to the person giving the evidence.
[16]
To believe that a truthful person would tell the same story when questioned is also to believe that a person who is lying would tell different stories. However, the corollary beliefs might also be true: a lying person would tell the same story when questioned because it is necessary to appear to be completely consistent, while a truthful person might tell different stories when questioned because that is the way the situation at hand unfolded. Without verifiable evidence to bring certainty to the beliefs, each belief is sheer speculation.
[17]
Because there is no evidence on the record to support the RPD's speculative implausibility conclusion, I find that it is made in reviewable error.
[18]
Furthermore, the Applicant's sworn testimony of his reasons for not giving a full description of the basis of his claim at the POE, and for not including what he said at the POE in his BOC was effectively disregarded by the RPD in the decision rendered. Because the RPD was required to accept the Applicant's sworn testimony, unless supportable reasons to doubt its truthfulness were clearly stated, and this requirement was not met, I find that the decision under review was made in further reviewable error.
ORDER
[19]
THIS COURT ORDERS that
the decision under review is set aside and the matter is sent back for redetermination before a differently constituted panel.
[20]
There is no question to certify.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur, un citoyen afghan, sollicite l'asile au Canada, car il affirme avoir une crainte subjective et objective d'être exposé, dans le cas où il serait obligé de retourner en Afghanistan, à plus qu'une simple possibilité de persécution sous le régime de l'article 96 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR], ou à un risque probable, sous le régime de l'article 97 de la part des talibans.
[2]
La présente demande vise la décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié qui a rejeté la demande du demandeur en raison de la question principale du manque de crédibilité de celui-ci quant au témoignage qu'il a présenté pour étayer le bien-fondé de sa demande d'asile.
[3]
La conclusion fondamentale de la SPR qui gouverne le rejet de la demande du demandeur est que cette dernière n'a pas de fondement véridique, parce que le demandeur est un menteur (décision, au paragraphe 81). Cette décision est principalement fondée sur la conclusion de la SPR qu'il y a une prétendue différence entre les déclarations du demandeur au Point d'entrée (PDE) et ses déclarations dans le formulaire Fondement de la demande d'asile (formulaire FDA) rempli deux semaines après son arrivée. Pour les motifs énoncés ci-dessous, la Cour conclut que la décision de la SPR a été rendue en contravention au droit régissant les conclusions tirées relativement à la crédibilité.
[4]
Toutefois, il faut d'abord trancher la question de savoir si l'audience à la SPR a été menée en violation de l'équité.
I.
Audience menée en violation de l'obligation d'équité
[5]
Au début de l'audience à la SPR, un grand obstacle a été soulevé relativement à la question de l'interprétation du témoignage du demandeur. Le demandeur parle la langue dari de l'Afghanistan. Dans son formulaire FDA, le demandeur a décrit les problèmes d'interprétation qu'il a subis au PDE, parce qu'on lui avait assigné un interprète de l'Iran parlant la langue farsi. Par conséquent, pour l'audition de sa demande, le demandeur a expressément exigé un interprète qui parle le dialecte dari de l'Afghanistan (voir le formulaire FDA, à la page 9).
[6]
Toutefois, à l'audience, on a donné au demandeur un interprète de l'Iran, et non pas de l'Afghanistan et ainsi, la conseil du demandeur a présenté une opposition en bonne et due forme à la poursuite de l'audience sans l'interprète demandé.
[7]
En guise d'avant-propos à l'opposition, la conseil du demandeur a fait référence aux difficultés de communication que le demandeur a subies lors de son entrevue au PDE:
[traduction]
CONSEIL: Bien. Comme cela ressort du formulaire Fondement de la demande d'asile, M. Mujadidi a demandé à avoir un interprète qui parle la langue dari, et en particulier qu'il soit originaire de l'Afghanistan. À la frontière, il a eu des difficultés à comprendre l'interprète et à se faire comprendre de celui-ci, car ce dernier était originaire de l'Iran et parlait la langue farsi. Cela ne remet pas en cause la compétence de l'interprète que nous avons aujourd'hui. Telle n'est pas la question, mais il y a différents termes qui sont utilisés en farsi et dans la langue de mon client ---
(Dossier du tribunal, à la page 389)
De plus, le demandeur a expliqué que les accents sont différents entre une personne originaire de l'Afghanistan qui parle le dari et une personne originaire de l'Iran qui parle le dari:
[traduction]
DEMANDEUR: Certains des termes de votre côté peuvent être différents de ceux de mon côté. C'est la raison pour laquelle je veux simplement éviter qu'il y ait des erreurs ici.
COMMISSAIRE: Mais, savez-vous qu'ils sont différents?
DEMANDEUR: Oui, les accents de l'Afghanistan et de l'Iran sont différents.
(Dossier du tribunal, à la page 389)
[8]
Néanmoins, la SPR a décidé de poursuivre ainsi:
[traduction]
COMMISSAIRE: Alors avez-vous quelque difficulté que ce soit à comprendre [l'interprète] ?
DEMANDEUR: Pas en ce moment, mais plus nous avancerons plus les difficultés pourraient survenir.
COMMISSAIRE: D'accord. Alors M. l'interprète avez-vous quelque difficulté que ce soit à le comprendre?
Interprète: Non, je n'en ai pas.
COMMISSAIRE: D'accord. Alors, je proposerai que nous continuions et s'il a quelque difficulté que ce soit, il peut le dire immédiatement.
CONSEIL: Si nous le constatons.
COMMISSAIRE: Je ne pourrais pas le constater, je ne parle pas la langue dari.
CONSEIL: Moi non plus.
COMMISSAIRE:
Cependant, si le demandeur n'était pas en mesure de comprendre quelque chose, alors il pourrait dire qu'il ne comprend pas. Jusqu'à présent, il semble bien aller. Nous devons simplement nous assurer que les microphones sont retournés.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
CONSEIL:
Je veux simplement relever mon opposition à poursuivre pour qu'elle figure au dossier; je donnerai toutefois à mon client certaines directives
.
COMMISSAIRE: D'accord.
CONSEIL: D'accord. S'il y a quoi que ce soit que vous ne comprenez pas, s'il vous plaît veuillez nous en faire part dès que possible, d'accord?
COMMISSAIRE: Maintenant, je sais que vous avez des connaissances en anglais parce que vous avez répondu avant la traduction et que vous avez continué à répondre en anglais. Ainsi, il est important d'attendre la traduction parce que je veux m'assurer que vous avez entièrement compris ce qu'on vous a demandé. Et c'est aussi important, c'est dans votre intérêt de communiquer dans votre langue dari, parce que même si vous voulez répondre en anglais, vous pouvez ne pas communiquer ou vous pouvez dire quelque chose que vous n'aviez pas l'intention de dire.
(Dossier du tribunal, aux pages 389 et 390)
[9]
Ainsi, plutôt que de faire droit à l'opposition de la conseil du demandeur, la SPR a choisi de ne pas en tenir compte, de poursuivre et de faire peser la responsabilité de la traduction sur le demandeur. Selon la Cour, un tel procédé était manifestement injuste.
[10]
Il ressort du dossier qu'en raison de l'approche de la SPR relativement à la question de l'interprétation, il y avait certainement de sérieux problèmes d'interprétation du témoignage du demandeur à l'audience, lesquels ont donné lieu à des conclusions défavorables, vivement contestées, tirées par la SPR et portant sur la crédibilité. Par conséquent, la Cour conclut que la conduite de la SPR à l'audience constituait un manquement à l'obligation d'équité due au demandeur.
II.
Manquement au droit relatif aux conclusions portant sur la crédibilité
[11]
Le demandeur est entré au Canada à partir des États-Unis, à Fort Erie. Au PDE, le demandeur a été interrogé afin qu'on détermine son admissibilité à présenter une demande d'asile. Dans la décision rendue, la SPR énonce les questions posées et les réponses données et elle poursuit par la description d'une prétendue différence entre les déclarations du demandeur au PDE et ses déclarations dans son formulaire FDA de la façon suivante:
Pendant l'entrevue à Fort Erie, le demandeur d'asile a déclaré à l'agent de l'ASFC qu'il ne voulait pas retourner en Afghanistan en raison de la situation générale qui y sévit. L'échange s'est déroulé de la façon qui suit:
[traduction]
Q: Quel était le but de votre voyage aux États-Unis?
R: Je suis venu en visite, parce que la situation en Afghanistan n'est pas très bonne et que l'occasion s'est présentée pour moi de venir au Canada, comme je n'ai personne aux États-Unis.
Q: Saviez-vous que vous alliez venir au Canada avant de quitter l'Afghanistan?
R: Non, je n'avais pas l'intention de venir ici, mais ils m'ont dit que la situation en Afghanistan était vraiment mauvaise, et c'est à ce moment que j'ai décidé de venir au Canada.
Q: À quelle situation faites-vous référence?
R: Il y a des bombardements, des enlèvements ...
Q: D'accord, mais c'est comme ça depuis longtemps. Qu'est-ce qui a changé depuis que vous êtes arrivé aux États-Unis?
R: Avant que je quitte l'Afghanistan, j'étais toujours stressé de partir de chez moi pour me rendre au travail, mais lorsque j'étais aux États-Unis, il y a eu un incident qui a fracassé beaucoup de vitres dans les bureaux. J'ai été informé que je ne devrais pas revenir. Il y a aussi beaucoup de discussions quant au fait que l'OTAN [Organisation sur Traité de l'Atlantique Nord] quittera l'Afghanistan en 2014. Si cela se produit, la situation se détériorera beaucoup avec les talibans. Pour cette raison, tant les plus jeunes que les plus vieux craignent ce qui les attend en Afghanistan.
Le tribunal a souligné au demandeur d'asile que les allégations se trouvant dans son formulaire FDA sont différentes, c'est-à-dire qu'il dit avoir été menacé par les talibans et être pourchassé par ceux-ci. Il a donné au demandeur d'asile l'occasion de clarifier ces éléments de preuve incohérents. Il a déclaré ce qui suit:
[traduction]
C'est parce que lorsque j'étais à Vive la Casa, j'ai commencé par communiquer avec une conseil. Il y avait une conseil à cet endroit. Elle s'appelait Alex. Je lui ai parlé et lui ai demandé s'il était correct pour moi de donner tous les renseignements dont je dispose lorsque j'arriverai à la frontière.
Elle m'a dit que, à son avis, je ne devrais pas tout dévoiler là-bas. Elle m'a dit que plus je parlerais de mon cas, plus je me ferais poser des questions
. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
Le tribunal lui a demandé s'il y avait autre chose. Le demandeur d'asile a déclaré:
[traduction]
Et le second point est que je n'ai pas réussi à trouver le sommeil cette nuit-là, et ce, jusqu'au matin suivant, car j'étais à bord de la voiture qui nous a amené jusqu'à la frontière pour que je ne manque pas l'entrevue. La voiture devait arriver à l'heure pour m'amener de Viva la Casa jusqu'à la frontière. Puis je me suis dit que, si je ne leur racontais pas mon récit en détail, ils me demanderaient des documents, et je n'étais pas certain du temps que j'y passerais s'ils me demandaient des documents. Je me suis dit que, si je restais là, les membres de ma famille en Afghanistan et ma tante au Canada seraient très anxieux. Voilà pourquoi j'ai raconté ce récit.
(Décision, aux paragraphes 16 à 18)
[12]
L'exposé circonstancié du demandeur dans le formulaire FDA donne beaucoup de précisions sur les menaces que les talibans lui ont faites en Afghanistan. Les déclarations au PDE ne sont pas mentionnées dans le formulaire FDA (voir le dossier du tribunal, aux pages 26 à 31).
[13]
La conclusion tirée par la SPR relativement à la différence entre les déclarations du demandeur au PDE et ses déclarations dans le formulaire FDA est la suivante:
Il est raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'un demandeur d'asile donne suite à sa demande d'asile avec diligence. Faire des efforts raisonnables pour fournir tous les renseignements pertinents dans le cadre d'une demande d'asile fait partie intégrante de la diligence. En fait, le demandeur d'asile a eu toutes les occasions de le faire. Le motif pour lequel un demandeur d'asile quitte son pays est le motif même pour lequel un demandeur d'asile présente une demande d'asile,
et il est raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que ce motif soit le même à toutes les étapes de la procédure de demande d'asile
. Cette logique s'applique même si elle pourrait avoir pour inconvénient d'obliger le demandeur d'asile à répondre à plus de questions ou de fournir davantage de renseignements. Le tribunal souligne également que, en l'espèce, les motifs invoqués par le demandeur d'asile pour demander l'asile au Canada dans les notes prises au point d'entrée ne sont pas contenus dans son formulaire FDA. Par conséquent, il n'est pas question ici de l'omission de détails,
mais plutôt de l'omission du motif principal de la demande d'asile et de la mention d'allégations qui ont par la suite été omises
.
Les éléments de preuve incohérents du demandeur d'asile quant au motif principal de sa demande d'asile mettent en doute sa crédibilité
. La crédibilité du demandeur d'asile est également mise en doute par les explications changeantes qu'il a fournies pour expliquer l'incohérence de la preuve. [Non souligné dans l'original.] (Décision, aux paragraphes 30 et 31)
[14]
Ainsi, pour l'essentiel, la SPR a conclu que si le demandeur disait la vérité, il aurait raconté le même récit au PDE et dans le formulaire FDA. Autrement dit, il est invraisemblable que le demandeur dise la vérité au PDE et dans son formulaire FDA, parce que les déclarations dans chacun de ces documents sont différentes.
[15]
Le droit relatif aux conclusions portant sur la crédibilité est bien établi aux paragraphes 10 et 11 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
En ce qui a trait aux conclusions défavorables sur la crédibilité en général et les conclusions d'invraisemblance en particulier, le juge Muldoon a énoncé, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), à la page 305, suivant lequel lorsqu'un revendicateur du statut de réfugié affirme la véracité de certaines allégations, ces allégations sont présumées véridiques sauf s'il existe des raisons de douter de leur véracité. Le tribunal n'a cependant pas appliqué le principe dégagé dans l'arrêt Maldonado au demandeur et a écarté son témoignage à plusieurs reprises en répétant qu'il lui apparaissait en grande partie invraisemblable. Qui plus est, le tribunal a substitué à plusieurs reprises sa propre version des faits à celle du demandeur sans invoquer d'éléments de preuve pour justifier ses conclusions.
7. Un tribunal administratif peut tirer des conclusions défavorables au sujet de la vraisemblance de la version des faits relatée par le revendicateur, à condition que les inférences qu'il tire soient raisonnables.
Le tribunal administratif ne peut cependant conclure à l'invraisemblance que dans les cas les plus évidents, c'est-à-dire que si les faits articulés débordent le cadre de ce à quoi on peut logiquement s'attendre ou si la preuve documentaire démontre que les événements ne pouvaient pas se produire comme le revendicateur le prétend
. Le tribunal doit être prudent lorsqu'il fonde sa décision sur le manque de vraisemblance, car les revendicateurs proviennent de cultures diverses et que des actes qui semblent peu plausibles lorsqu'on les juge en fonction des normes canadiennes peuvent être plausibles lorsqu'on les considère en fonction du milieu dont provient le revendicateur. [voir L. Waldman,
Immigration Law and Practice
(Markham, ON, Butterworths, 1992) à la page 8.22]
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
Il n'est pas difficile de comprendre que, en toute justice pour la personne qui jure de dire toute la vérité, des motifs concrets s'appuyant sur une preuve forte doivent exister pour qu'on refuse de croire cette personne. Soyons clairs. Dire qu'une personne n'est pas crédible, c'est dire qu'elle ment. Donc, pour être juste, le décideur doit pouvoir exprimer les raisons qui le font douter du témoignage sous serment, à défaut de quoi le doute ne peut servir à tirer des conclusions. La personne qui rend témoignage doit bénéficier de tout doute non étayé.
[16]
Le fait de croire qu'une personne honnête raconterait le même récit lorsqu'elle est interrogée consiste aussi à croire qu'une personne qui ment raconterait différents récits. Toutefois, des croyances corollaires peuvent aussi être vraies: une personne qui ment raconterait le même récit lorsqu'elle est interrogée parce qu'il est nécessaire qu'elle paraisse totalement cohérente, tandis qu'une personne honnête peut raconter différents récits lorsqu'elle est interrogée, parce que c'est ainsi que la situation en cause s'est déroulée. Sans preuve vérifiable qui apporte une certitude sur les croyances, toute croyance est une pure conjecture.
[17]
En raison du fait qu'il n'y a pas de preuve dans le dossier à l'appui de la conclusion conjecturale d'invraisemblance tirée par la SPR, la Cour juge que cette conclusion est entachée d'une erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[18]
En outre, selon le témoignage assermenté du demandeur, les raisons pour lesquelles il n'a pas donné une entière description du bien-fondé de sa demande au PDE, et les raisons pour lesquelles il n'a pas inclus ce qu'il a dit au PDE dans son formulaire FDA ont été omises de la décision rendue par la SPR. En raison du fait que la SPR devait accepter le témoignage assermenté du demandeur, à moins que des motifs corroborants de douter de sa véracité ne soient clairement énoncés, et cette exigence n'a pas été remplie, la Cour conclut que la décision soumise au contrôle est entachée d'une autre erreur susceptible de contrôle.
ORDONNANCE
[19]
LA COUR ORDONNE:
la décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle est annulée et l'affaire est renvoyée à un tribunal différemment constitué pour qu'il statue à nouveau sur celle-ci.
[20]
Il n'y a pas de question à certifier.

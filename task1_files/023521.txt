I.
Introduction
[1]
Noël, J.
: This is an application for leave to commence an application for judicial review pursuant to section 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] of a decision of Stephen J. Gallagher of the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, dated March 19, 2014, which upheld the decision of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] determining that the Applicant was neither a Convention Refugee nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of IRPA.
II.
Facts
[2]
The Applicant is a 57 year old citizen of Cambodia.
[3]
She is at risk of persecution because of her husband's political activities.
[4]
The Applicant's husband was beaten by thugs on June 2, 2012 after his decision to stand for elected office for the Cambodian National Rescue Party [CNRP].
[5]
Following the accusations from the police that he was holding illegal political meetings at his home, he was forced into retirement from his public service job at the Ministry of Finance and Economy.
[6]
The Applicant's husband received a number of high ranking members of the CNRP at his residence in March 2013. Four policemen came and threatened to charge him with the crime of holding an illegal political meeting.
[7]
The Applicant and her husband fled Cambodia and arrived on May 22, 2013 in Canada, where their three children live. They claimed refugee protection soon after. The Applicant's husband passed away on June 20, 2013.
III.
RPD Decision
[8]
In its decision dated August 15, 2013, the RPD denied the Applicant's refugee claim because it did not find the Applicant's allegations of persecution of her husband, and by extension to herself, credible.
[9]
The Applicant filed an appeal of this decision to the RAD on December 9, 2013.
[10]
The RAD rendered a negative decision on March 26, 2014.
IV.
Contested Decision
[11]
The Applicant did not present new evidence nor did she request an oral hearing.
[12]
The RAD first discusses the applicable standard of review to the RPD decision. According to the RAD, its assessment of the RPD determination of the Applicant's credibility attracts the reasonableness standard, as applied by the Federal Court in evaluating RPD decisions related to credibility. The RAD objective is therefore to "review the RPD decision for the "existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law". This understanding flows from
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ".
[13]
The RAD frames the core issue of its review as follows: did the RPD reach a conclusion on the credibility of the claimant, which is "unreasonable"? In answering this question, the RAD listed the different credibility findings the RPD made. The RAD is of the opinion that the RPD reasonably concluded that the Applicant had not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that her or her husband had been targeted by the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] and that the Applicant and her husband's travel are inconsistent with what would be expected if they were in fact at risk of persecution or persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of IRPA.
[14]
The RAD subsequently analyses the background documentation of the political situation in Cambodia and finds that the "general thrust of the background documentation is that there is significant corruption and cronyism in Cambodia, but little targeting of opponents [...] which is inconsistent with the Applicant's allegations" (RAD decision at para 6).
[15]
The RAD finally concludes that the RPD analysis of the Applicant's testimony and corroborative evidence reasonable. The RPD decision therefore "falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law" (RAD decision at para 24).
V.
Parties' Submissions
[16]
The Applicant first submits that the applicable standard of review to be applied by the RAD is that of correctness and not of reasonableness. The Applicant grounds its position on the decision of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where the Court of Appeal stated that "the Board, itself an administrative tribunal under a statutory regime, does not immerse itself in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's standard of review analysis that governs a court's judicial review. The Board should do what the statute tells it to do". The Applicant then states that based on sections 110, 111, 111.1, 171 of IRPA, section 159.91 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 and section 24 of the
Refugee Appeal Division Rules
, SOR/2012-257 [RAD Rules], the legislator intended for the RAD to apply a correctness standard, particularly because section 111 of IRPA states that the tribunal will refer a case back to the RPD for re-determination, only when it finds that the decision is wrong in fact or in mixed law and fact. Therefore, a right to an appeal and not a right to a judicial review was created. Therefore, because the RAD applied the wrong standard of review, the intervention of this Court is warranted.
[17]
The Respondent argues, however, that the RAD applied the correct standard of review, namely reasonableness, because, as per sections 110 and 111 of IRPA, the RAD may allow an appeal if it is satisfied that there is an error of law, error of fact or error of mixed fact and law with the RPD decision. It can only substitute its opinion or return the matter for re-determination when such an error is made. The Respondent adds that an appeal to the RAD is a ""true appeal" in the sense that the appellate body is bound by the findings of fact and of mixed fact and law of a lower tribunal absent a demonstrable error" (Respondent's memorandum at para 31). An appeal to the RAD is therefore not a hearing
de novo
.
[18]
The Applicant further submits that the RAD erred when it went beyond the content of the RPD decision and looked at the documentation pertaining to the political situation in Cambodia as this was not addressed in the RPD decision. The Applicant also argues that the RAD erred by not providing the Applicant with a hearing to address its concerns about the political context in Cambodia.
[19]
The Respondent replies by saying that the RAD did not err by referring to the country documentation included in evidence before the RPD. He is of the opinion that the Applicant did not demonstrate any reviewable error. Further, the RAD did not exceed its jurisdiction when it referred itself to the documentary evidence, as it was part of the RPD record.
VI.
Defendant's Further Memorandum
[20]
The Respondent begins by reiterating the same arguments as in their original submissions. A few new arguments are also added.
[21]
In terms of new arguments, the Respondent first states that in the event that the RAD applied the wrong standard of review with respect to the credibility of the Applicant under appeal, it has no bearing on the results, which in turn means that it would be useless to send the matter back to be re-examined.
[22]
The Respondent adds that Justice Shore's decisions
in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] suggesting that the RAD must conduct its own independent analysis of the totality of the evidence that was before the RPD and come to its own conclusions contradict the wording of section 110 of IRPA, since this section created a right of appeal for certain refugee claimants, where the appellant before the RAD has the burden to raise specific questions of fact, of law or of mixed law and fact.
[23]
The Respondent further submits that:
"it should be noted that the subsection 110(1) indicated that the appeal must be in accordance with the RAD Rules of practice. RAD Rule 3(3)(g)(i) requires the appellant to outline the errors made by the RPD which form the grounds of the appeal. In addition, RAD Rule 3(3)(g)(ii) imposes the onus on the appellant of identifying the specific location of the error within the RPD record. Rule 9(2)(f) imposes a similar obligation on the Minister when he brings and appeal of an RPD decision to the RAD" (Respondent's further memorandum at para 42).
[24]
The Respondent also adds that because the RPD is the trier of fact at first instance, it has the benefit of seeing the claimant and witnesses, whereas an appeal to the RAD is, by contrast, a paper process. The RPD is therefore in a better position than the RAD to assess testimonial, factual and evidentiary issues with perhaps the exception where the RAD holds a hearing.
[25]
With regards of the role of the RAD on appeal of a RPD decision, the Respondent states that the RAD decision to apply the reasonableness standard in reviewing the RPD decision is a question closely tied to its function and process. This issue is not a question of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, it is not a "true jurisdictional issue" and is instead a question connected to the RAD home statute; as such the correctness standard should not apply. The RAD has the necessary degree of expertise to determine the appropriate standard of review to apply on appeal of a RPD decision.
[26]
The Respondent further states that IRPA contains a privative clause at section 162, which gives each division of the Board, including the RAD, exclusive jurisdiction over questions of law, fact and jurisdiction. This militates in favour of deference to the RAD on a question such as to the appropriate standard of review.
[27]
In the case at bar, the Respondent argues that because the RPD decision related to an issue of credibility, which is a question of fact, the reasonableness standard applies.
[28]
The Respondent also submits that based on recent jurisprudence of this Court, even though the wrong standard of review has been applied by the RAD, deference is owed by the RAD to the RPD when it comes to questions of credibility. The RAD decision should thus stand, even if the wrong standard was applied.
[29]
Finally, the Respondent states that the RAD did not have to give notice to the Applicant that it might examine other documents than those referred to by the RPD in its decision, namely the US Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Cambodia for 2012, which was part of the record.
VII.
Issues
[30]
The parties address two main issues in their submissions, namely the applicable standard of review the RAD should apply to the RPD decision on appeal and whether or not the RAD properly assessed the credibility findings of the Applicant.
[31]
Having reviewed the submissions, the RPD and the RAD decisions, I find that it will be necessary to deal only with the credibility findings as assessed by the RAD in light of the RPD analysis on these matters. It will be seen that this issue is wholly determinative of the application for judicial review. Therefore, the question to be answered is as follows:
1. Did the RAD do a thorough analysis of the Applicant's claim in light of the credibility findings made by the RPD?
VIII.
Standard of Review
[32]
Several judges of this Court have issued an opinion as to which standard of review this Court should apply to the scope of the review by the RAD on an appeal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], Justice Martineau explains that many judges are of the opinion that the correctness standard applies (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Garcia Alvarez
];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 34 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 9 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Other decisions state, however, the opposite, namely that this Court should perhaps apply the reasonableness standard when reviewing the standard of intervention chosen by the RAD in its review of a RPD decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at paras 16 to 26; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
at para 18).
[33]
As such, the standard of review this Court should apply when reviewing the standard of intervention chosen by the RAD in its review of a RPD decision is undecided. As noted, this question is not determinative with regards to the case at bar. I therefore adhere to Justice Martineau's approach in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
at para 37, that until this question is resolved by the Federal Court of Appeal, a pragmatic approach should be used for the determination of the present judicial review.
[34]
In the present appeal, the RAD is being asked to deal only with the credibility findings made by the RPD, as the appeal shows. As it is well recognized, in such cases, the standard of review applicable is that of reasonableness.
IX.
Analysis
A.
Did the RAD do a thorough analysis of the Applicant's appeal in light of the credibility findings made by the RPD?
[35]
In our case, the central issue raised by the appeal is the credibility of the Applicant. There is currently an ongoing trend in the jurisprudence from this Court with regards to the level of deference the RAD should give to RPD decisions when credibility is the heart of the matter.
[36]
There are, at the moment, and to my knowledge, four decisions from this Court that maintain the RAD decisions confirming the RPD conclusions when the central issue was that of the credibility of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the RPD concluded that the Applicant lacked credibility based on her testimony. Justice Locke states that, in this case, it was right for the RAD to show deference to the RPD credibility finding (at para 19). Justice Locke further adds that the RAD seems to have conducted its own credibility analysis of the Applicant in its decision (at para 20). He therefore rejects the application for judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Gagné states that she is of the opinion that "deference is only owed by the RAD to the RPD credibility findings and where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching its conclusion" (at para 39). Justice Gagné goes on to say that the RAD reviewed and assessed the evidence presented before the RPD and gave proper deference to the RPD credibility findings (at paras 46-48). She also notes that the RAD made its own assessment of the evidence and provided a more detailed analysis than the RPD with regards to the subjective fear of the Applicant of returning to his home country (at para 49). She therefore dismisses the application for judicial review (at para 50).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Shore arrives at a similar conclusion, where he concludes that because the RPD decision was "solely founded on credibility, the RAD applied the appropriate level of deference towards the RPD determinations of the Applicant's credibility" (at para 20). Justice Shore concludes, again, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that the RAD validly exercised deference to the RPD credibility conclusions (at para 26). However, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
, Justice Martineau states that he will not judicially impose on the RAD any degree of deference whatsoever to be applied to RPD decisions (at para 91). Being prudent, Justice Martineau also does not speculate nor gives a definitive opinion as to the scope of the examination of a RPD decision on appeal to the RAD (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[37]
In the case at bar, in its decision, the RAD reiterates the RPD credibility conclusions and concludes that the RPD findings were reasonable. A reading of the RAD decision shows that it read the transcript of the RPD hearing, the documentation filed and that it reassessed the credibility findings of the RPD. It even went further than the RPD in its analysis of the political context in Cambodia by comparing the Applicant's allegations to the US Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Cambodia for 2012. The RAD notes that the Applicant's allegations contradict this documentary evidence. It is also based on this last evaluation that the RAD confirmed the RPD conclusions. The RAD assessment therefore goes further than simply confirming the RPD decision. The RAD conducted its own examination of the record before the RPD in making its decision. This situation is therefore very similar to the four cases identified above, where this Court confirmed the RAD decision and rejected the application for judicial review. Whatever the deference to be given by the RAD to RPD credibility findings, the RAD in this case looked at the evidence, dealt with the credibility issues raised by the appeal and concluded that the RPD credibility findings were sound, as its own assessment reveals. I, therefore, conclude that the RAD, by doing its review and own assessment of the evidence, did assume fully its role as an appellate tribunal and did show the required deference to the credibility findings made by the RPD.
[38]
The Applicant makes the argument that the RAD went beyond the decision of the RPD and found additional non-credibility reasons to maintain the RPD decision when it examined documentary evidence on Cambodia as they relate to the political context. The Applicant submits that this is a reviewable error because the RAD exceeded its jurisdiction. She also argues that when she filed her appeal she did not know that she had to address matters not discussed in the RPD decision. She further submits that the RAD erred because it did not provide the Applicant with a hearing to address its concerns about the political context in Cambodia. I disagree with the Applicant for the reasons below.
[39]
First, subsection 110(3) states that "Subject to subsections (3.1), (4) and (6), the Refugee Appeal Division must proceed without a hearing, on the basis of the record of the proceedings of the Refugee Protection Division [...]". The documentation regarding the political context in Cambodia was part of the record before the RPD. The RAD could therefore refer to it in making its decision. Is it not the role of an appellate tribunal to look at the record and assess the evidence in light of the arguments made? Obviously, the answer is affirmative. The Applicant is also wrong in arguing that the RAD erred by not providing the Applicant with a hearing to address its concerns about the political context in Cambodia. As Justice Shore explains in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
, a hearing can only be held before the RAD when an Applicant raises new documentary evidence as referred to in subsection 110(4) of IRPA. In the case at bar, just as in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , no new evidence was presented before the RAD to justify holding a hearing under subsection 110(6). I also add that consulting the documentation was directly related to the arguments made on appeal. They are based on the Cambodia political climate which is not supported by some of the background documentation. The RAD found that: "the general thrust of the background documentation is that there is significant corruption and cronyism in Cambodia, but little targeting of opponents" which was inconsistent with the applicant's allegations. The RAD, thus, committed no error by referring itself to the documentary evidence as part of the record of the RPD and not holding a hearing.
X.
Conclusion
[40]
The application for judicial review is dismissed. I find reasonable the RAD assessment of the RPD credibility findings on appeal and I therefore conclude that the RAD has shown proper deference of the RPD credibility findings.
[41]
The parties were invited to submit questions for certification and counsel for the Respondent did suggest the following:
1. What is the scope of the Refugee Appeal Division's review when considering an appeal of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division?
[42]
For the reasons mentioned above, it will not be necessary to deal with it.
JUDGMENT
[43]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that:
1. The application for judicial review of the decision of Stephen J. Gallagher, dated March 19, 2014, is dismissed.
2. No question of general importance will be certified.

[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire, présentée sur le fondement du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [LIPR], à l'encontre de la décision datée du 19 mars 2014 par laquelle Stephen J. Gallagher, de la Section d'appel des réfugiés [SAR] de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié, a confirmé la décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR], qui avait conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger aux termes des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR.
II.
Faits
[2]
La demanderesse est une citoyenne du Cambodge âgée de 57 ans.
[3]
Elle risque d'être persécutée en raison des activités politiques de son mari.
[4]
Le mari de la demanderesse a été battu par des voyous le 2 juin 2012 après avoir décidé de se porter candidat aux élections pour le parti de sauvetage national du Cambodge [CNRP].
[5]
Après avoir été accusé par la police de tenir des rassemblements politiques illégaux dans sa maison, il a été contraint d'abandonner son poste de fonctionnaire au ministère des Finances et de l'Économie.
[6]
Le mari de la demanderesse avait reçu certains membres haut placés du CNRP à sa résidence en mars 2013. Quatre policiers sont arrivés et ont menacé de l'accuser du crime d'avoir tenu un rassemblement politique illégal.
[7]
La demanderesse et son mari ont fui le Cambodge et, le 22 mai 2013, ils sont arrivés au Canada, où vivent leurs trois enfants. Ils ont demandé l'asile peu après. Le mari de la demanderesse est décédé le 20 juin 2013.
III.
Décision de la SPR
[8]
Dans sa décision datée du 15 août 2013, la SPR a rejeté la demande d'asile de la demanderesse, ayant jugé non crédibles les allégations de la demanderesse concernant la persécution subie par son mari et, par extension, par elle-même.
[9]
La demanderesse a interjeté appel de cette décision devant la SAR le 9 décembre 2013.
[10]
La SAR a rendu une décision défavorable le 26 mars 2014.
IV.
Décision contestée
[11]
La demanderesse n'a pas présenté de nouveaux éléments de preuve ni demandé la tenue d'une audience.
[12]
La SAR analyse d'abord la norme de contrôle applicable à la décision de la SPR. Elle estime que la détermination de la crédibilité de la demanderesse par la SPR commande la norme du caractère raisonnable, que la Cour fédérale applique quand elle évalue les décisions de la SPR concernant la crédibilité. La SAR a donc pour objectif « d'examiner la décision de la SPR pour en vérifier le caractère raisonnable, lequel "tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit". Cette interprétation est tirée de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . »
[13]
La SAR énonce comme suit la question centrale qu'elle doit trancher: La conclusion tirée par la SPR quant à la crédibilité de la demandeure d'asile est-elle [traduction] « déraisonnable »? En répondant à cette question, la SAR énumère les différentes conclusions sur la crédibilité tirées par la SPR. Selon la SAR, la SPR a conclu de manière raisonnable que la demanderesse n'avait pas établi, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que son mari ou elle avaient été pris pour cibles par le parti populaire cambodgien [CCP] et que les voyages faits par la demanderesse et son mari ne correspondaient pas au comportement attendu de personnes réellement exposées à un risque de persécution ou de personnes à protéger au sens des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR.
[14]
La SAR analyse ensuite les documents d'information sur la situation politique au Cambodge et constate que « l'idée générale qui y est véhiculée est que la corruption et le copinage sont à grande échelle au Cambodge, mais que le ciblage d'opposants politiques n'est pas répandu [...] ce qui ne cadre pas avec les allégations de l'appelante » (décision de la SAR, au paragraphe 6).
[15]
La SAR conclut enfin que la SPR a fait une analyse raisonnable du témoignage de la demanderesse et des éléments de preuve corroborants, et que, par conséquent, la décision de la SPR « appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (décision de la SAR, au paragraphe 24).
V.
Observations des parties
[16]
La demanderesse soutient d'abord que la norme de contrôle que doit appliquer la SAR est celle de la décision correcte et non celle du caractère raisonnable. La demanderesse fonde cette thèse sur l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dans lequel la Cour d'appel a statué que [traduction] « [l] e Conseil de révision, lui-même un tribunal administratif relevant d'un régime établi par la loi, ne se plonge pas dans l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle exposée dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , qui régit le contrôle judiciaire par une cour. Le Conseil de révision doit tout simplement faire ce que la loi lui prescrit de faire ». La demanderesse affirme ensuite que, d'après les articles 110, 111, 111.1, 171 de la LIPR, l'article 159.91 du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227, et l'article 24 des
Règles de la Section d'appel des réfugiés
, DORS/2012-257 [Règles de la SAR], l'intention du législateur était que la SAR applique la norme de la décision correcte, plus particulièrement parce que l'article 111 de la LIPR dispose que le tribunal renverra l'affaire à la SPR pour nouvel examen uniquement si elle estime que la décision est erronée en fait ou en droit et en fait. Ainsi, un droit d'appel, et non un droit de contrôle judiciaire, a été créé. Par conséquent, la Cour doit intervenir, parce que la SAR a appliqué la mauvaise norme de contrôle.
[17]
Toutefois, selon le défendeur, la SAR a appliqué la bonne norme de contrôle, c'est-à-dire la norme du caractère raisonnable, parce que, conformément aux articles 110 et 111 de la LIPR, la SAR peut accueillir un appel si elle conclut que la décision de la SPR contient une erreur de droit, une erreur de fait, ou une erreur mixte de fait et de droit. Le cas échéant, elle peut alors y substituer la décision qui aurait dû être rendue ou renvoyer l'affaire pour nouvel examen. Le défendeur ajoute qu'un appel interjeté devant la SAR est [traduction] « un "véritable appel", en ce sens que l'organe d'appel est lié par les conclusions de fait et les conclusions mixtes de fait et de droit tirées par un tribunal inférieur en l'absence d'erreur démontrable » (mémoire du défendeur, au paragraphe 31). Par conséquent, un appel devant la SAR ne constitue pas une audience
de novo
.
[18]
La demanderesse soutient en outre que la SAR a commis une erreur en ne se limitant pas au contenu de la décision de la SPR et en examinant la documentation sur la situation politique au Cambodge, que la SPR n'avait pas mentionnée dans sa décision. La demanderesse ajoute que la SAR a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas d'audience lui permettant de dissiper les doutes de la SAR sur le contexte politique au Cambodge.
[19]
Le défendeur réplique en affirmant que la SAR n'a pas commis d'erreur en se reportant à la documentation sur le pays contenue dans les éléments de preuve présentés à la SPR. À son avis, la demanderesse n'a pas établi l'existence d'une erreur susceptible de contrôle. De plus, la SAR n'a pas outrepassé sa compétence en se reportant à la preuve documentaire, car cette preuve faisait partie du dossier de la SPR.
VI.
Mémoire supplémentaire du défendeur
[20]
Le défendeur commence par réitérer les arguments présentés dans ses observations initiales. Il ajoute aussi quelques nouveaux arguments.
[21]
Pour ce qui est des nouveaux arguments, le défendeur déclare d'abord qu'une possible application par la SAR de la mauvaise norme de contrôle à la question de la crédibilité de la demanderesse visée par l'appel n'aurait aucune incidence sur l'issue de l'affaire, ce qui signifie en retour qu'il serait inutile de renvoyer l'affaire pour nouvel examen.
[22]
Le défendeur ajoute que les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] rendues par le juge Shore, selon lesquelles la SAR doit procéder à sa propre analyse indépendante de la totalité des éléments de preuve présentés à la SPR et parvenir à ses propres conclusions, contredisent le libellé de l'article 110 de la LIPR, puisque cet article crée un droit d'appel pour certains demandeurs d'asile, l'appelant devant la SAR ayant le fardeau de soulever des questions de fait, de droit, ou mixtes de fait et de droit bien précises.
[23]
Le défendeur soutient également ce qui suit:
[traduction] [i]l convient de souligner que, selon le paragraphe 110(1), l'appel doit être interjeté conformément aux règles de procédure de la SAR. Aux termes du sous-alinéa 3(3)
g
)(i) des Règles de la SAR, l'appelant doit mentionner les erreurs commises par la SPR qui constituent les motifs d'appel. En outre, le sous-alinéa 3(3)
g
)(ii) des Règles de la SAR impose à l'appelant le fardeau d'indiquer l'endroit précis où se trouvent ces erreurs dans le dossier de la SPR. L'alinéa 9(2)
f
) impose une obligation similaire au ministre quand il porte en appel une décision de la SPR devant la SAR. (Mémoire supplémentaire du défendeur, au paragraphe 42.)
[24]
Parce que la SPR est le juge des faits de première instance, ajoute également le défendeur, elle a l'avantage de voir le demandeur d'asile et les témoins, tandis qu'un appel devant la SAR est, par contraste, un processus fondé sur le papier. La SPR est donc mieux placée que la SAR pour évaluer les témoignages, les faits et les éléments de preuve, sauf peut-être quand la SAR tient une audience.
[25]
En ce qui concerne le rôle de la SAR lorsqu'elle siège en appel d'une décision rendue par la SPR, le défendeur déclare que la décision prise par la SAR d'appliquer la norme du caractère raisonnable dans l'examen de la décision de la SPR est une question étroitement liée à sa fonction et à son processus. Il ne s'agit pas d'une question de droit revêtant une importance capitale pour le système juridique dans son ensemble; ce n'est pas une question « touchant véritablement à la compétence », mais plutôt une question liée à la loi constitutive de la SAR, de sorte que la norme de la décision correcte ne doit pas s'appliquer. La SAR a le degré d'expertise nécessaire pour déterminer la norme de contrôle à appliquer lorsqu'elle siège en appel d'une décision rendue par la SPR.
[26]
Le défendeur déclare aussi que la LIPR contient une disposition d'inattaquabilité à l'article 162, qui confère à chaque section de la Commission, y compris à la SAR, compétence exclusive pour connaître des questions de droit, de fait et de compétence. Cette disposition milite donc en faveur de la retenue envers la SAR à l'égard de questions comme celle de la norme de contrôle appropriée.
[27]
En l'espèce, soutient le défendeur, parce que la décision de la SPR porte sur une question de crédibilité, ce qui constitue une question de fait, la norme du caractère raisonnable s'applique.
[28]
Le défendeur soutient aussi que, selon la jurisprudence récente de la Cour, même si la SAR avait appliqué la mauvaise norme de contrôle, elle devait quand même faire preuve de retenue envers la SPR pour les questions de crédibilité. La décision de la SAR doit donc être maintenue, même si la mauvaise norme a été appliquée.
[29]
Enfin, le défendeur affirme que la SAR n'avait pas à aviser la demanderesse du fait qu'elle pouvait examiner d'autres documents que ceux que la SPR avait mentionnés dans sa décision, à savoir les
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012
sur le Cambodge publiés par les États-Unis, lesquels faisaient partie du dossier.
VII.
Questions en litige
[30]
Les parties soulèvent deux principales questions dans leurs observations, c'est-à-dire la norme de contrôle que la SAR doit appliquer lorsqu'elle siège en appel d'une décision rendue par la SPR, et la question de savoir si la SAR a fait une évaluation appropriée des conclusions sur la crédibilité de la demanderesse.
[31]
Après avoir examiné les observations et les décisions rendues par la SPR et la SAR, je conclus qu'il sera nécessaire d'examiner seulement l'évaluation faite par la SAR des conclusions sur la crédibilité à la lumière de l'analyse effectuée par la SPR à cet égard. Nous verrons que cette question suffit à trancher la demande de contrôle judiciaire. Par conséquent, la question à laquelle la Cour doit répondre est la suivante:
1. La SAR a-t-elle procédé à une analyse approfondie de l'appel de la demanderesse eu égard aux conclusions sur la crédibilité tirées par la SPR?
VIII.
Norme de contrôle
[32]
Plusieurs juges de la Cour se sont prononcés sur la norme de contrôle que la Cour doit appliquer à la question de la portée de l'examen fait par la SAR lorsqu'elle siège en appel. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], le juge Martineau explique que, selon de nombreux juges, la norme de la décision correcte s'applique (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Garcia Alvarez
];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 34 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 9 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). D'autres décisions, toutefois, sont à l'effet du contraire, à savoir que la Cour doit peut-être appliquer la norme du caractère raisonnable quand elle revoit la norme d'intervention choisie par la SAR lors de l'examen d'une décision de la SPR (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], aux paragraphes 16 à 26; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 18).
[33]
Ainsi, la norme de contrôle que la Cour doit appliquer quand elle revoit la norme d'intervention choisie par la SAR lors de l'examen d'une décision de la SPR n'est pas arrêtée. Comme il a été mentionné, cette question n'est pas déterminante en l'espèce. Je souscrirai donc à la démarche mise de l'avant par le juge Martineau dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 37: tant que la question n'est pas résolue par la Cour d'appel fédérale, une approche pragmatique doit être adoptée pour trancher la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire.
[34]
En l'espèce, la SAR doit seulement examiner les conclusions sur la crédibilité tirées par la SPR, comme le montre l'appel. Et comme il est bien établi, la norme de contrôle applicable dans de tels cas est celle du caractère raisonnable.

Analyse
A.
La SAR a-t-elle procédé à une analyse approfondie de l'appel de la demanderesse eu égard aux conclusions sur la crédibilité tirées par la SPR?
[35]
Dans le cas qui nous occupe, la question centrale soulevée par l'appel est celle de la crédibilité de la demanderesse. À l'heure actuelle, une tendance est observée dans la jurisprudence de la Cour relativement au degré de retenue dont la SAR doit faire preuve à l'égard des décisions de la SPR quand la crédibilité est au cœur de l'affaire.
[36]
Il y a, en ce moment et à ma connaissance, quatre décisions où la Cour a confirmé les décisions par lesquelles la SAR maintenait les conclusions de la SPR quand la question centrale était celle de la crédibilité du demandeur. Dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la SPR avait conclu que la demanderesse manquait de crédibilité sur le fondement de son témoignage. Le juge Locke estime que, dans cette affaire-là, la SAR avait eu raison de faire preuve de déférence à l'endroit de la conclusion de la SPR concernant la crédibilité de la demanderesse (au paragraphe 19). Le juge Locke ajoute que la SAR semblait avoir fait sa propre analyse de la crédibilité de la demanderesse dans sa décision (au paragraphe 20). Il rejette donc la demande de contrôle judiciaire. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la juge Gagné exprime l'avis que « la SAR doit faire preuve de retenue uniquement à l'égard des conclusions de la SPR concernant la crédibilité, et lorsque celle-ci jouit d'un avantage particulier pour tirer une conclusion » (au paragraphe 39). La juge Gagné déclare ensuite que la SAR avait examiné et évalué la preuve présentée à la SPR et accordé un degré de retenue approprié aux conclusions de la SPR concernant la crédibilité (aux paragraphes 46 à 48). Elle ajoute que la SAR avait effectué sa propre évaluation de la preuve et fourni une analyse plus détaillée que ne l'avait fait la SPR relativement à la crainte subjective du demandeur de retourner dans son pays (au paragraphe 49). Elle rejette donc la demande de contrôle judiciaire (au paragraphe 50). Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Shore conclut de façon similaire que, « étant donné que la décision de la SPR est uniquement fondée sur des conclusions de crédibilité, la SAR a fait preuve du degré de retenue adéquat relativement aux conclusions de la SPR portant sur la crédibilité du demandeur » (au paragraphe 20). Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Shore conclut, une fois encore, que la SAR avait validement fait preuve de déférence envers les conclusions de crédibilité de la SPR (au paragraphe 26). Toutefois, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, le juge Martineau déclare qu'il n'imposera pas judiciairement à la SAR quelque norme de déférence que ce soit à l'égard des décisions de la SPR (au paragraphe 91). Guidé par la prudence, le juge Martineau ne veut pas spéculer ni exprimer une opinion définitive sur la portée de l'examen d'une décision de la SPR fait en appel par la SAR (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 52).
[37]
En l'espèce, dans sa décision, la SAR réitère les conclusions sur la crédibilité tirées par la SPR et conclut qu'elles sont raisonnables. La lecture de la décision de la SAR montre que la SAR a lu la transcription de l'audience devant la SPR et les documents produits, et qu'elle a réévalué les conclusions sur la crédibilité tirées par la SPR. Elle a même poussé plus loin l'analyse du contexte politique au Cambodge que ne l'avait fait la SPR en comparant les allégations de la demanderesse aux
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012
sur le Cambodge publiés par les États-Unis. La SAR souligne que les allégations de la demanderesse ne cadrent pas avec cette preuve documentaire. C'est également en se fondant sur cette dernière évaluation que la SAR a confirmé les conclusions de la SPR. L'évaluation effectuée par la SAR ne se limite pas à une simple confirmation de la décision de la SPR. La SAR a procédé à son propre examen du dossier présenté à la SPR afin de rendre sa décision. Cette situation est donc très similaire aux quatre affaires mentionnées ci-dessus, dans lesquelles la Cour a confirmé la décision de la SAR et rejeté la demande de contrôle judiciaire. Quel que soit le degré de retenue dont la SAR devait faire preuve à l'égard des conclusions sur la crédibilité tirées par la SPR, la SAR a, en l'espèce, examiné la preuve et les questions de crédibilité en appel, et a conclu que les conclusions sur la crédibilité de la SPR étaient sensées, comme sa propre évaluation le révélait. Par conséquent, je conclus que la SAR, en procédant à l'examen et à sa propre évaluation de la preuve, a joué pleinement son rôle de tribunal d'appel et a fait preuve de la retenue requise à l'égard des conclusions sur la crédibilité tirées par la SPR.
[38]
La demanderesse avance que la SAR est allée au-delà de la décision de la SPR et a trouvé d'autres motifs liés à l'absence de crédibilité pour confirmer la décision de la SPR quand elle a examiné la preuve documentaire sur le Cambodge concernant le contexte politique. Selon la demanderesse, il s'agit d'une erreur susceptible de contrôle, parce que la SAR a outrepassé sa compétence. La demanderesse affirme également que, lorsqu'elle a interjeté appel, elle ne savait pas qu'elle devait traiter de questions non abordées dans la décision de la SPR. La demanderesse ajoute que la SAR a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas d'audience lui permettant de dissiper les doutes de la SAR sur le contexte politique au Cambodge. Je ne suis pas d'accord avec la demanderesse pour les motifs suivants.
[39]
D'abord, le paragraphe 110(3) dispose que « [s] ous réserve des paragraphes (3.1), (4) et (6), la section procède sans tenir d'audience en se fondant sur le dossier de la Section de la protection des réfugiés [...] ». La documentation sur le contexte politique au Cambodge faisait partie du dossier qui avait été présenté à la SPR. La SAR pouvait donc s'y reporter afin de rendre sa décision. Le tribunal d'appel n'a-t-il pas pour rôle d'examiner le dossier et d'évaluer les éléments de preuve à la lumière des arguments présentés? De toute évidence, c'est bien son rôle. La demanderesse a également tort d'affirmer que la SAR a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas d'audience pour lui permettre de dissiper les doutes de la SAR concernant le contexte politique au Cambodge. Comme l'a expliqué le juge Shore dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, la SAR peut tenir une audience seulement lorsque le demandeur présente de nouveaux éléments de preuve documentaire, comme le précise le paragraphe 110(4) de la LIPR. En l'espèce, tout comme dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aucun nouvel élément de preuve n'avait été présenté à la SAR pour justifier la tenue d'une audience au titre du paragraphe 110(6). J'ajouterais également que le fait de consulter la documentation était directement lié aux arguments présentés en appel, qui étaient fondés sur le climat politique au Cambodge, que certains des documents ne corroboraient pas. La SAR a conclu que « l'idée générale qui [...] est véhiculée [dans la documentation sur la situation dans le pays] est que la corruption et le copinage sont à grande échelle au Cambodge, mais que le ciblage d'opposants politiques n'est pas répandu », idée qui ne cadrait pas avec les allégations de la demanderesse. Donc, la SAR n'a pas commis d'erreur en consultant elle-même la preuve documentaire contenue dans le dossier de la SPR et en ne tenant pas d'audience.
X.
Conclusion
[40]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. J'estime que la SAR a fait une évaluation raisonnable des conclusions sur la crédibilité de la SPR en appel, et je conclus donc que la SAR a fait preuve de la retenue qui convenait à l'égard des conclusions sur la crédibilité de la SPR.
[41]
Les parties ont été invitées à proposer des questions aux fins de certification, et l'avocat du défendeur a proposé celle-ci:
1. Quelle est la portée de l'examen de la Section d'appel des réfugiés lors d'un appel d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés?
[42]
Pour les motifs énoncés ci-dessus, il ne sera pas nécessaire d'aborder cette question.

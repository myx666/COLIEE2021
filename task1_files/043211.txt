 Lutfy, J. 
 : This case is about a visa officer's refusal to issue student authorizations to young students wishing to attend primary and secondary schooling in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) has published  
 Processing Student Authorizations 
  [see footnote 1] ("the  
 Guideline 
 ") for the use of officers in assessing applications for student visas. Guidelines, of course, must be used with care. They can serve as "'general policy' or 'rough rules of thumb'" to structure the discretion conferred upon the visa officer. [see footnote 2] Guidelines, however, should not fetter the visa officer's exercise of discretion by crystallizing into binding and conclusive rules. [see footnote 3] It is of interest, in this application for judicial review, to note the extent to which the  
 Guideline 
  reflects the spirit of s. 3(e) of the  
 Immigration Act 
  [see footnote 4] in highlighting the benefits foreign students bring to Canada. Section 3.5.1 of the  
 Guideline 
  sets out factors underlying the assessment of student bona fides:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "There are two major factors underlying the assessment of student bona fides.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "First, foreign students have not represented a control or enforcement problem for Canada. Second, there is a new and growing realization in Canada that foreign students yield significant benefits for our economy.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In administering its foreign student program, CIC must support the policies of other federal government departments, provinces and educational institutions who are anxious to capitalize on the potential which foreign academic talent represents.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In establishing whether a foreign student is a bona fide visitor, officers should be guided by the knowledge that foreign students educated in Canada provide needed links for trade and investment, and that they are an excellent source of future skilled immigrants. It is not uncommon for highly qualified students, particularly those at the graduate level, to work for a year after completing their course of studies and apply for permanent residence status through visa offices in the USA. CIC views this development as a positive outcome.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Foreign students have the burden of proving to the satisfaction of officers that they are bona fide visitors.  
 However, in these cases, the general question of bona fides is not so much whether the applicant is a prospective immigrant, but whether the applicant is a prospective illegal immigrant. 
 " (Emphasis added)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Background And The Visa 
 
 Officer's Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The applicants, brothers who are now 14 and 12, are citizens of India and live in New Delhi with their parents. In March 1997, they applied for temporary entry in Canada as students for the 1997-98 academic year. In May 1997, a visa officer in the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi denied their applications.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  The visa officer decided that the applicants did not have sufficient funds for their tuition fees, their maintenance while in Canada and their transportation costs as required by s. 15(1)(b) of the  
 Immigration Regulations 
 . [see footnote 5] She also concluded that the applicants had insufficient "income and/or assets to justify a trip of this nature" and that they did not provide credible reasons for attending school in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  In her affidavit filed in response to these applications for judicial review, the visa officer explained her determination that the applicants are not genuine visitors and her view that they were not seeking to enter Canada for a temporary purpose:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "First of all, despite their claims to considerable affluence, the applicant's parents' income tax returns disclosed that the applicant's parents had very low incomes, of less than $5,000 per year in Canadian funds. There was no other evidence which satisfied me that the Mittals were of greater means. I did not believe that persons of such apparently limited income would incur the expense of sending their children to Canada simply to attend elementary school. Secondly, the reason given for sending the applicant to Canada was stated to be the quality of education and the crowded classrooms in India. The applicant could, however, receive an excellent education at a private school in India, and avoid crowded classrooms, at considerably less expense and inconvenience. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 The visa officer's two reasons concerning the parents' insufficient income and the availability of less expensive private schooling in India will be considered in turn.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Visa Officer's Finding 
 
 Concerning Insufficient Funds  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The applicants' material concerning the financing of their one-year academic stay in Canada was straightforward. Letters of acceptance for courses in grades 5 and 8 from their private school in Toronto establish partial payment of the $7,500 tuition fee for each student. A Canadian chartered bank confirmed that it held $10,000 in mutual fund investments for each child. The applicants' uncle and aunt who reside in Scarborough, Ontario undertook to provide all material support during their stay in Canada. The applicants have previously visited these relatives in Canada and would live with them while attending school here. The same chartered bank confirmed that it employed the uncle as an Account Manager-Commercial Banking at an annual salary of $43,300, not including bonuses. (The uncle deposed that the applicants also had term deposits with the chartered bank but the record discloses that these funds are in Indian rupees, not Canadian dollars.)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Section 2.7.3 of the  
 Guideline 
  provides that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Section R15(1)(b)(i) clearly states only that the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that he/she has sufficient financial resources available to him/her for payment of tuition fees once in Canada. Tuition fees vary between jurisdictions, and may be as high as $10,000. Student authorizations may not, therefore, be refused to minors who do not present proof of payment of tuition fees. A student authorization may not, however, be issued unless the applicant provides a letter of acceptance from the appropriate educational authorities. The onus, therefore, is on the provinces, and not on CIC officers, to ensure their school boards and divisions include provisions for the payment of fees as a pre-condition to the issuance of acceptance letters. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 Section 4.11.1 of the  
 Guideline 
  suggests that student authorizations for primary and secondary schooling usually be issued on a year-to-year basis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  This visa officer received other information concerning the business and land investments of the applicants' father to establish the family's roots in India. On the basis of her review of the parents' financial information, the visa officer indicated in her CAIPS notes that this data was not "indicative of a family who can afford to send two sons to a school" in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  In my view, the family's net worth, even if the visa officer were correct in concluding that it was substantially less than that asserted by the parents, was not relevant to her assessment of the applicants' ability to meet the criteria of s. 15(1)(b) of the  
 Immigration Regulations 
 . The record clearly establishes that the applicants had the "sufficient financial resources" for the one-year period for which the student authorizations were sought. The visa officer's contrary conclusion constitutes a reviewable erroneous finding of fact in that it was made without regard to the material before her.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Visa Officer's Finding 
 
 Concerning No Credible Reasons 
 
 For Studying In Canada  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Section 9(1.2) of the  
 Immigration Act 
  [see footnote 6] provides that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "A person who makes an application for a visitor's visa shall satisfy a visa officer that the person is not an immigrant. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
                                                                                                       <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "La personne qui demande un visa de visiteur doit convaincre l'agent des visas qu'elle n'est pas un immigrant. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 This provision requires that the visa officer be satisfied that the applicants were genuine students seeking to enter Canada for a temporary purpose. She found otherwise.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  After reviewing the material, the visa officer concluded that the parents' expressed desire to afford the applicants quality education without crowded classrooms could be realized with "an excellent education in a private school in India ... at considerably less expense and inconvenience". Her finding of there being no credible reasons for the applicants studying in Canada is, in the words of the respondent's counsel, rationally connected to s. 9(1.2) of the  
 Act 
 . She adds further that the applicants have the burden of establishing that their stay in Canada would be temporary.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  There are at least two serious concerns with the visa officer's finding concerning the absence of credible reasons for studying in Canada. Firstly, the record discloses no information concerning the availability and the quality of private schooling in India. Secondly, even if the visa officer had access to such information and she were correct with respect to India's private school system, she should have provided the applicants' family with an opportunity to address her concerns which are based on information not proffered by the applicants. Such a course of action is suggested in the  
 Guideline 
  in s. 2.7.4 dealing with the bona fides of minor students:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "If officers wish to take into account outside information, particularly where that information leads to concerns/doubts about the applicant's bona fides, they must be able to show that the applicant was made aware of the information taken into account and/or the concerns and was given an opportunity to address those concerns. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 This directive properly, in my view, assigns to the visa officer the same duty of fairness in the assessment of student authorizations which the Court of Appeal imposed in reviewing applications for permanent residence. [see footnote 7] In this case, the visa officer chose to dispose of the applications without communicating with the applicants' family through an interview or otherwise concerning the information she obtained with respect to the quality and cost of private schooling in India.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The reasons of my colleague Gibson, J., in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the conclusion I have reached concerning the visa officer's finding that the applicants have no credible reasons for studying in Canada. While a question was certified in  
 Wong 
  and the matter is now pending before the Court of Appeal, Justice Gibson's views concerning the temporary purpose inherent in a student's visa issued for one year are worthy of repetition:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Such an application is for permission for a clearly 'temporary purpose'. It is in the nature of student visas that they are issued for limited periods of time. If the minor applicant, together with his family, concluded in the future that he wished to continue to pursue his studies in Canada, a renewal of his visa or a new visa would be required. It would be open to the respondent to examine the totality of the circumstances each time that the minor applicant applied for renewal or a new visa. If, at any stage during the course of the minor applicant's education it became apparent that the minor applicant's ties to Hong Kong had so deteriorated as to demonstrate that they were insufficient to ensure his return there, then refusal of the request for renewal or for a new visa would clearly be justified." [see footnote 9]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 This approach is consistent with the statute and its regulations. It also reinforces the directive to visa officers that in applying s. 9(1.2) of the  
 Act 
  [see footnote 10] "... the general question of bona fides is not so much whether the applicant is a prospective immigrant, but whether the applicant is a prospective illegal immigrant". [see footnote 11]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  For these reasons, these applications for judicial review will be granted and the matters referred for redetermination by another visa officer. I assume that every effort will be made to deal with these cases expeditiously. Neither party requested the certification of a serious question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Applications allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

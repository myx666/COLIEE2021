[1]
Tremblay-Lamer, J.
: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to section 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act] of a decision of Immigration Counsellor A. Luhowy [the counsellor] made on December 23, 2010, where he determined that the applicants are inadmissible pursuant to section 40(1)(a) of the Act, due to misrepresentation of a material fact in their application for permanent residence.
BACKGROUND FACTS
[2]
The applicants, Marzieh Goudarzi, Hamidreza Dinrvand, Asal Dinrvand, and Arshia Dinrvand, are citizens of Iran. Ms. Marzieh Goudarzi [the principal applicant] applied as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker class and her husband, daughter, and son applied as accompanying family members. She is an accountant.
[3]
In 2005, the principal applicant hired an immigration consultant, Arash Rahmatian, to assist her in the preparation of her family's application to immigrate to Canada. The consultant was not an authorized immigration consultant or lawyer. He prepared the application and translated it into English. The CAIPS notes indicate that the application was received on or before August 29, 2005 by the Canadian Embassy in Damascus.
[4]
The principal applicant states that, unbeknownst to her, Mr. Rahmatian included an International English Language Testing System [IELTS] test result that turned out to be fraudulent [the False Document]. She claims to have specifically asked Mr. Rahmatian about the requirement to take an IELTS test as part of her application, but was told that she could write the test at some point in the future, as the processing of her application could take six years.
[5]
She alleges that she was never given a copy of the forms that were submitted by Mr. Rahmatian.
[6]
The application did not progress for several years until the applicants were notified in a letter sent by email on January 14, 2009 that the consultant they had retained was not an authorized representative.
[7]
On April 28, 2010, the application was transferred to the Canadian Embassy in Warsaw as part of backlog reduction. On July 21, 2010, Canadian officials contacted the applicants to request updated information, as the processing of their application was set to begin. The applicants responded with updated submissions on October 18, 2010, including 2010 IELTS results for the principal applicant.
[8]
On October 22, 2010, Immigration Officer M. Maryszczak [the officer] sent the principal applicant a letter detailing his concerns with her application [the Fairness Letter]. The Fairness Letter notified her that the officer had been unable to verify the authenticity of the False Document, and as a result, he was considering a finding that she was inadmissible for misrepresentation pursuant to subsection 40(1)(a) of the Act. Another consultant the applicants had retained by that time responded on December 20, 2010, stating that the principal applicant was unaware of the False Document and had been the victim of a fraudulent immigration consultant, and asked that she not be penalized for Mr. Rahmatian's actions.
[9]
The officer rejected the explanation that the principal applicant was not aware of the False Document as not credible since the application clearly indicated that an English language test was required to be submitted with the application. On December 23, 2010, the counsellor accepted the recommendation that the principal applicant be found to be inadmissible for misrepresentation under subsection 40(1)(a) of the Act.
APPLICABLE LAW
[10]
Section 40(1)(a) of the Act states:
40. (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible for misrepresentation
(a) for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration of this Act;
40. (1) Emportent interdiction de territoire pour fausses déclarations les faits suivants:
a) directement ou indirectement, faire une présentation erronée sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou une réticence sur ce fait, ce qui entraîne ou risque d'entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la présente loi;
PRELIMINARY QUESTION
Can the Court consider the evidence submitted by the applicants that was not before the decision-maker?
[11]
The respondent submits that the applicants have filed evidence that was not before the counsellor in his decision. The respondent submits that the applicants are not entitled to adduce fresh evidence upon judicial review, except to resolve issues of procedural fairness or jurisdiction:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The respondent submits that these exceptions do not apply in this case, and therefore the evidence should be struck from the application record. I agree and thus the Court will not rely on this additional evidence.
ISSUES
[12]
The issues in this application are:
1) Was it reasonable for the counsellor to conclude that there was a misrepresentation?
2) If so, was it reasonable for the counsellor to conclude that this misrepresentation was material?
3) Does section 40(1)(a) require the applicants' knowledge of the misrepresentation?
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[13]
Misrepresentation is an issue of mixed fact and law and is therefore reviewable on the reasonableness standard:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 96 at paragraph 14.
[14]
The questions of whether section 40(1)(a) includes a knowledge component is a question of law related to the interpretation of the officer's home statute and will thus also be reviewed on a reasonableness standard:
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[46] At para. 22 of Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), LeBel and Cromwell JJ. state:
On the other hand, our Court has reaffirmed that general questions of law that are
both
of central importance to the legal system as a whole and outside the adjudicator's specialized area of expertise, must still be reviewed on a standard of correctness, in order to safeguard a basic consistency in the fundamental legal order of our country. [Emphasis added.]
In other words, since Dunsmuir, for the correctness standard to apply, the question has to not only be one of central importance to the legal system but also outside the adjudicator's specialized area of expertise.
[...]
[48] The Commissioner's interpretation of s. 50(5) PIPA relates to the interpretation of his own statute, is within his expertise and does not raise issues of general legal importance or true jurisdiction. His decision that an inquiry does not automatically terminate as a result of his extending the 90-day period only after the expiry of that period is
therefore reviewable on the reasonableness standard
. (Emphasis added.)
ANALYSIS
Issue No. 1
Was it reasonable for the counsellor to conclude that there was a misrepresentation?
[15]
The applicants submit that there was no misrepresentation, because the False Document was clearly not a test result. While the document mimics the appearance of an IELTS Test Report, it states that it is "just a domestic document". Thus, no reasonable person could conclude that it was an IELTS Test Report, and there is no misrepresentation.
[16]
The respondent submits that the False Document was clearly designed to mislead the immigration authorities to believe it was an IELTS Test Report. Thus, the respondent submits there clearly was a misrepresentation.
[17]
The Court agrees with the respondent that the False Document constitutes a misrepresentation: an examination of its physical appearance reveals that it is clearly designed to imitate the appearance of an IELTS Test Report. There is no other plausible purpose behind the submission of the False Document other than to mislead the immigration authorities into thinking that the file was complete and that the principal applicant had satisfied the language requirements. An official doing an initial completeness review of the file would not necessarily notice that it was fraudulent. I do not accept that any reasonable person would say that the purpose of this document was anything other than to mislead. It was thus wholly reasonable for the counsellor to conclude that it was intended to mislead the authorities to believe it to be an authentic test result.
Issue No. 2
Was it reasonable for the counsellor to conclude that the misrepresentation was material?
[18]
The applicants submit in the alternative that if there was a misrepresentation, it was not material. The applicants rely on the CIC Enforcement Manual ENF 2,
Evaluating Inadmissibility
, which states that a misrepresentation should only be considered material if it affects the process. Since only the most recent language test results are to be considered, the False Document could not have affected the process.
[19]
The applicants rely on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in which the applicant committed a misrepresentation by submitting a fraudulent document, but the Court found the misrepresentation to be immaterial.
[20]
The applicants submit that this case is similar to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA): in those cases, the visa officer misinformed the applicants regarding the basis for the concerns about misrepresentation. The applicants assert that the officer misled them in the Fairness Letter, stating that they had submitted an unverifiable IELTS Test Report-since the False Document was clearly not a test result, this was inaccurate information.
[21]
The applicants also submit that the officer erred by finding their response to the Fairness Letter implausible-since their consultant was so unscrupulous as to falsify a language test result, it was unreasonable to conclude that the consultant would not also falsify the form on which the applicants are purported to have acknowledged submitting those results.
[22]
The respondent submits that the applicants' submissions on materiality are contrary to the wording of section 40(1)(a) of the Act-when the False Document was submitted, it was the only evidence of the principal applicant's language proficiency. Had it not been submitted, the application would have been deemed incomplete and returned. Thus, the misrepresentation affected the process, and was material:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . I agree for the following reasons.
[23]
In determining whether a misrepresentation is material, regard must be had for the wording of the provision, and its underlying purpose.
[24]
Section 40(1)(a) is to be given a broad interpretation in order to promote its underlying purpose:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The objective of this provision is to deter misrepresentation and maintain the integrity of the immigration process- to accomplish this objective the onus is placed on the applicant to ensure the completeness and accuracy of his or her application. Section 40(1)(a) is broadly worded to encompass misrepresentations even if made by another party, without the knowledge of the applicant:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The applicant cannot misrepresent or withhold any material facts that could induce an error in the administration of the Act.
[25]
In this case, the misrepresented fact was whether the principal applicant had passed an IELTS language test. There is no doubt this fact was material to her application-federal skilled worker applicants must demonstrate language proficiency to be accepted. As soon as the False Document was submitted, it could have induced an error in the administration of the Act, because a decision-maker could have relied upon it to conclude that the principal applicant had demonstrated language proficiency.
[26]
I agree with the respondent that to be material, a misrepresentation need not be decisive or determinative. It will be material if it is important enough to affect the process. The False Document was thus clearly material because the application could not have been processed without it.
[27]
The fact that the misrepresentation was caught before the final assessment of the application does not assist the applicants. The materiality analysis is not limited to a particular point in time in the processing of the application-the fact that the principal applicant had submitted more recent language test results does not render the earlier misrepresentation immaterial. Such a result would reflect a narrow understanding of materiality that is contrary to the wording and purpose of section 40(1)(a) of the Act. The False Document was submitted and it was material.
[28]
This case is distinguishable from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above: there, the fraudulent document was irrelevant to the determination of the application. Here, language test results are clearly relevant to the application at issue. The decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is also distinguishable: the officer in that case was mistakenly informed that a letter confirming the applicant's degree was forged-further evidence proved that the degree itself was authentic. Here, the 'test' for which the False Document purports to provide results never occurred, and thus the reasoning from that case does not apply.
[29]
Therefore, I find that the visa officer was reasonable to conclude that the False Document constituted a material misrepresentation pursuant to section 40(1)(a) of the Act.
Issue No. 3
Does section 40(1)(a) require the applicants' knowledge of the misrepresentation?
[30]
The applicants suggest that in order to be found inadmissible pursuant to section 40(1)(a) of the Act, a party must have acted with subjective intent, i.e. knowledge of the misrepresentation.
[31]
The applicants cite the recent decision of Justice Hughes, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), which considered this question. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant was found inadmissible under section 40(1)(a) by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) because she had listed her husband as the father of her two children, when in fact he was only the biological child of one. The couple had briefly separately almost 30 years prior, and during that separation the applicant had had a one-time affair with another man. The couple then reconciled and neither suspected that the husband was not the father of the child in question. This fact only came to light when an official at CIC ordered DNA testing. Despite the lack of knowledge on the part of the applicant, she was declared inadmissible for misrepresentation pursuant to section 40(1)(a).
[32]
In conducting the judicial review of this decision, Justice Hughes surveyed cases in which a misrepresentation finding was upheld, and noted that they all contained an element of
mens rea
, or subjective intent. He concluded that, because the applicants in the decision under review had no reason to believe they were misrepresenting a material fact, it was unreasonable to find them inadmissible for misrepresentation. He certified a question on the issue, but the respondent did not pursue an appeal.
[33]
I find that the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is not of assistance to the applicants in this case. That decision was dependent on a highly unusual set of facts, and cannot be relied upon for the general proposition that a misrepresentation must always require subjective knowledge. Rather, the general rule is that a misrepresentation can occur without the applicant's knowledge, as noted by Justice Russell in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 35:
[35] With respect to inadmissibility based on misrepresentation, this Court has already given section 40 a broad and robust interpretation. In
Khan
, above, Justice O'Keefe held that the wording of the Act must be respected and section 40 should be given the broad interpretation that its wording demands. He went on to hold that section 40 applies where an applicant adopts a misrepresentation but then clarifies it prior to a decision.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  this Court held that section 40 applies to an applicant where the misrepresentation was made by another party to the application and the applicant had no knowledge of it.
The Court stated that an initial reading of section 40 would not support this interpretation but that the section should be interpreted in this manner to prevent an absurd result. (Emphasis added.)
A few cases have carved out a narrow exception to this rule, but this will only apply for
truly exceptional circumstances
, where the applicant honestly and
reasonably
believed they were not misrepresenting a material fact.
[34]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Hughes cites the decision of Justice Harrington in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, the applicant was found inadmissible for misrepresentation because he had failed to disclose the existence of a child that the Board found he reasonably should have suspected was his own. (Notably, like the applicants in the case before me, this applicant was found to not be credible.) Justice Harrington considered certifying a question similar to that in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, but concluded that the decision was unreasonable on other grounds.
[35]
The passage of
Singh
referred to by Justice Hughes contains an oft-cited portion of Justice O'Reilly's judgment in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[15] Under s. 40(1)(
a
) of IRPA, a person is inadmissible to Canada if he or she "withholds material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration" of the Act. In general terms, an applicant for permanent residence has a "duty of candour" which requires disclosure of material facts. This duty extends to variations in his or her personal circumstances, including a change of marital status:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) (QL). Even an innocent failure to provide material information can result in a finding of inadmissibility; for example, an applicant who fails to include all of her children in her application may be inadmissible:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) (QL).
An exception arises where applicants can show that they honestly and reasonably believed that they were not withholding material information
:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) (QL). (Emphasis added.)
[36]
Despite being frequently cited, the "exception" referred to in this passage has received limited application. Its originating case, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, involved an unusual set of facts: the applicant was being sponsored by her husband, but unbeknownst to her the husband withdrew his sponsorship. Canadian officials then misled the applicant by asking her to return the visa because they claimed it contained an error. They implied it would be returned to her, corrected. The applicant had English-speaking relatives inspect the visa and, after they assured her that nothing was wrong with it, she used it to enter Canada. The Immigration Appeal Board found her to be a person described in section 27(1)(e) of the former
Immigration Act
, 1976, SC 1976-77, c 52 [now RSC 1985, c I-2)], i.e. that she had been "granted landing ... by reason of any fraudulent or improper means". This finding was set aside by the Federal Court of Appeal because the applicant had "reasonably believed" that she was not withholding information relevant to her admission.
[37]
When considered within its factual context, therefore, the exception in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is relatively narrow. As Justice MacKay noted while distinguishing the case before him in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
41 The present circumstances may also be distinguished from those  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  on the basis that the information which the applicant failed to disclose was not information regarding which he was truly subjectively unaware. The applicant in the present case was not unaware that he was married.
Nor was it information, as  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the knowledge of which was beyond his control.
This was not information which had been concealed from him or about which he had been misled by Embassy officials. The applicant's alleged ignorance regarding the requirement to report such a material change in his marital status and his inability to communicate this information to an immigration officer upon arrival does not, in my opinion, constitute "subjective unawareness" of the material information as contemplated  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . (Emphasis added)
Furthermore, I emphasize that a determinative factor in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case was that the applicant had
reasonably believed
that she was not withholding information from Canadian authorities. In contrast, in the case before this Court the applicants did not act reasonably-the principal applicant failed to review her application to ensure its accuracy.
[38]
It must be kept in mind that foreign nationals seeking to enter Canada have a duty of candour:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Section 16(1) of the Act reads that "[a] person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must produce a visa and all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires."
[39]
As noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (at paragraph 44):
...The purpose of section 40(1)(
a
) of the Act is to ensure that applicants provide complete, honest and truthful information in every manner when applying for entry into  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) and the present facts went well beyond mere silence.
[40]
In keeping with this duty of candour, there is, in my opinion, a duty for an applicant to make sure that when making an application, the documents are complete and accurate. It is too easy to later claim innocence and blame a third party when, as in the present case, the application form
clearly
stated that language results were to be attached, and the form was signed by the applicants. It is only in exceptional cases where an applicant can demonstrate that they honestly and
reasonably
believed that they were not withholding material information, where "the knowledge of which was beyond their control", that an applicant may be able to take advantage of an exception to the application of section 40(1)(a). This is not such a case.
[41]
The applicants allege that they had no knowledge of the misrepresentation and wish to exonerate themselves by blaming their immigration consultant. Indeed, they claim to have not even seen the submitted copy of their application forms. As a result, they submit that the fraudulence of their immigration consultant should serve as a defence to the application of section 40(1)(a).
[42]
In response to this submission, I find the comments of Justice Mosley in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to be instructive:
[16] The applicant was in Bangladesh at the time the updated application was submitted. He admitted during the phone conversation on May 26th that he "could have signed the blank form for the consultant". The new form had further discrepancies. The applicant apparently chose to rely on the consultant to submit the required information without personally verifying that it was accurate.
The applicants in this case chose to rely on their consultant. The principal applicant claims that she was not given the opportunity to review her application. It would be contrary to the applicant's duty of candour to permit the applicant to rely now on her failure to review her own application. It was her responsibility to ensure her application was truthful and complete-she was negligent in performing this duty.
[43]
Furthermore, in order for the applicants to rely on a 'defence' to the finding of misrepresentation, that defence must be grounded either in statute or common law. In my view, there is no such defence under the Act: the wording of section 40(1)(a) is broad enough to encompass misrepresentations made by another party, of which the applicant was unaware:
Wang
, above at paragraphs 55-56. Furthermore, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court held that the fact that an immigration consultant was to blame for the misrepresentation was no defence. As already discussed, the applicants cannot avail themselves of the exception for an innocent mistake.
[44]
I additionally do not find that there is any relevant defence under the common law. The applicants were entitled to procedural fairness, but that entitlement was minimal and it was satisfied in this case: the applicants received the Fairness Letter advising them of the officer's concerns about the False Document, and giving them 30 days to respond. The applicants' response to the Fairness Letter was a brief email from their new consultant, stating they were duped by their earlier consultant, and asking that they not be punished for his actions.
[45]
As demonstrated by the CAIPS notes, the officer considered this response, but found it not credible since the application form clearly stated that language results were attached and that form was signed by the applicants. The Court finds that it was reasonably open to the officer to reach this conclusion, faced with no more than the bald assertion by the applicants that they were duped. The applicants provided no supporting evidence of their claim to have been innocent in the misrepresentation, and the officer is not required to make further inquiries if the applicants' response to the Fairness Letter was deficient:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . As stated by Justice Crampton (as he then was), "To impose such an obligation on a visa officer would be akin to requiring a visa officer to give advance notice of a negative decision, an obligation that has been expressly rejected. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL);
Sharma
, above)" (ibid at paragraph 28). There is no further entitlement to now try again to prove that they were defrauded and therefore should not be found inadmissible.
[46]
The applicants seek to rely on the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> for the proposition that the negligence of counsel (or in this case, fraudulence of a consultant) should not cause an applicant who has acted with care to suffer. However, as already discussed, the applicants in this case did not act with care-they failed to take responsibility for the contents of their application, and review it before it was submitted. It is not sufficient to not exercise diligence and then plead ignorance when caught. Therefore, the applicants cannot rely on the reasoning from this case to claim a defence to the finding of misrepresentation.
[47]
Furthermore, it seems to me that when a consultant, like in the present case, provides information that does not coincide with the instructions provided with an application, an applicant should be alerted to the possibility that the consultant's advice may not be accurate and should inquire with officials to make sure that what the consultant said was accurate.
[48]
The applicants submit that the visa officer had failed meet the duty of care required in the situation. They suggest that the False Document should have been immediately returned when it was received, because it was clearly a copy and not an original. The applicants' argument seems to be an attempt to separate the fraudulent aspect of the False Document from its other deficiencies-i.e. that the visa officer should have first realized the False Document was a copy and not an original, and then, rather than inspect it any further, immediately return it to the applicants and ask for an original instead.
[49]
The concept of a duty of care does not apply in this context-the
applicants
were subject to a duty of candour, which they did not satisfy. The initial screening officer was simply tasked with undertaking a "completeness" check of the application file. He owed no "duty of care" to the applicants.
[50]
The requirements of procedural fairness-which did exist-were in fact satisfied. When the visa officer later examined the False Document, he noted several problems with it (likely including the fact that it was evidently a copy), which led him to conclude it was fraudulent. The visa officer's obligation at that point was to advise the applicants that they were potentially inadmissible for misrepresentation. He discharged this obligation by sending the Fairness Letter and thus satisfied the requirements of procedural fairness.
[51]
The Court acknowledges that the problem of fraudulent immigration consultants is a serious one. However, this problem does not amount to a
defence
against the operation of section 40(1)(a). Furthermore, subject to the narrow exception discussed above, this Court has consistently found that an applicant can be inadmissible under section 40(1)(a) for misrepresentations made by another without the applicant's knowledge. There can thus clearly be no subjective intent or knowledge requirement to section 40: this would be contrary to the broad interpretation that the wording and purpose of the provision requires.
[52]
The application must therefore be dismissed.
Certified Question
[53]
The applicant has submitted the following question for the Court's certification:
Is a foreign national inadmissible for misrepresenting a material fact if at the time of filing his/her application for permanent residence or at the time of granting permanent residence he/she had no knowledge of the material fact that constituted such misrepresentation?
[54]
The respondent submits that no question should be certified in this case as too many factual conclusions would have to be presumed in the applicants' favour. However, if the Court disagrees with its submissions on this point, the respondent submits that the following question should be certified:
Where supporting documentation is submitted with a signed application form for permanent residence in Canada, but the applicant later states that he or she had no knowledge of the documentation submitted or part thereof, is the applicant still responsible for the veracity of all the supporting documentation for the purposes of the application of paragraph 40(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27, as amended?
[55]
In order for a question to be certified, it must arise from the case before the Court and raise a question of law of general importance that has not already been determined by the Federal Court:
Hyunh v R
, [1995] 1 FC 633, 88 FTR 60. Based on my reasoning above, I find that the answer to this question is already well-settled in this Court's jurisprudence and thus decline to certify the question.
JUDGMENT
[56]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. This application for judicial review is dismissed; and
2. No question of general importance is certified.

Marzieh Goudarzi, Hamidreza Dinrvand,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Tremblay-Lamer
[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), à l'encontre de la décision datée du 23 décembre 2010, par laquelle le conseiller en immigration A. Luhowy (le conseiller) a conclu que les demandeurs étaient interdits de territoire au sens de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la Loi, parce qu'ils avaient fait, dans leur demande de résidence permanente, une présentation erronée sur un fait important.
LE CONTEXTE FACTUEL
[2]
Les demandeurs, Marzieh Goudarzi, Hamidreza Dinrvand, Asal Dinrvand et Arshia Dinrvand sont citoyens de l'Iran. Mme Marzieh Goudarzi (la demanderesse principale) a présenté sa demande dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral), et son époux, sa fille et son fils l'ont fait en tant que membres de la famille l'accompagnant. Mme Goudarzi est comptable
[3]
En 2005, la demanderesse principale a retenu les services d'un consultant en immigration, M. Arash Rahmatian, pour l'aider à préparer la demande d'immigration de sa famille au Canada. Cet homme n'était pas un consultant en immigration autorisé ni un avocat. Il a préparé la demande et l'a traduite en anglais. Selon les notes inscrites dans le Système de traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration (les notes du STIDI), l'ambassade du Canada à Damas a reçu la demande le ou avant le 29 août 2005.
[4]
La demanderesse principale affirme que M. Rahmatian a inclus, à son insu, le résultat d'un test IELTS (Système international de tests de la langue anglaise) qui s'est révélé frauduleux (le faux document). Elle soutient avoir expressément posé des questions à M. Rahmatian sur l'obligation de passer un test IELTS dans le cadre de sa demande, mais celui-ci lui a dit qu'elle pouvait passer le test à une date ultérieure, car il était possible que le traitement de sa demande dure six ans.
[5]
Elle allègue n'avoir jamais reçu de copie des formulaires que M. Rahmatian a transmis.
[6]
Il ne s'est rien passé d'autre avant plusieurs années, jusqu'à ce qu'on avise les demandeurs par courriel, le 14 janvier 2009, que le consultant dont ils avaient retenu les services n'était pas un représentant autorisé.
[7]
Le 28 avril 2010, la demande a été transférée à l'ambassade du Canada à Varsovie dans le cadre d'un programme de réduction de l'arriéré. Le 21 juillet 2010, des fonctionnaires canadiens ont communiqué avec les demandeurs pour obtenir des renseignements à jour, car le traitement de leur demande allait commencer. Ils ont transmis des observations mises à jour le 18 octobre 2010, y compris le résultat du test IELTS de 2010 passé par la demanderesse principale.
[8]
Le 22 octobre 2010, l'agent d'immigration M. Maryszczak (l'agent) a envoyé à la demanderesse principale une lettre faisant état de ses doutes à propos de sa demande (la lettre d'équité). Cette lettre l'avisait que l'agent n'avait pas pu vérifier l'authenticité du faux document et que, de ce fait, il envisageait de conclure que la demanderesse principale était interdite de territoire pour fausses déclarations au sens de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la Loi. Un autre consultant dont les demandeurs avaient retenu à ce moment les services a répondu le 20 décembre 2010, disant que la demanderesse principale n'était pas au courant du faux document et avait été victime d'un consultant en immigration frauduleux et demandant qu'elle ne soit pas pénalisée pour les gestes que ce consultant avait posés.
[9]
L'agent a rejeté l'explication selon laquelle la demanderesse principale n'était pas au courant de l'existence du faux document; cette explication n'était pas crédible, a-t-il dit, parce que la demande indiquait clairement qu'elle devait être accompagnée des résultats d'un test d'anglais. Le 23 décembre 2010, le conseiller a souscrit à la recommandation de déclarer la demanderesse principale interdite de territoire pour fausses déclarations au sens de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la Loi.
LE DROIT APPLICABLE
[10]
L'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la Loi prescrit ce qui suit:
40. (1) Emportent interdiction de territoire pour fausses déclarations les faits suivants:
a
) directement ou indirectement, faire une présentation erronée sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou une réticence sur ce fait, ce qui entraîne ou risque d'entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la présente loi;
40. (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible for misrepresentation
(
a
) for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration of this Act;
QUESTION PRÉLIMINAIRE
La Cour peut-elle prendre en considération les éléments de preuve que les demandeurs ont produits et qui n'ont pas été soumis au décideur?
[11]
Le défendeur soutient que les demandeurs ont produit des éléments de preuve que le conseiller n'avait pas en main au moment où il a rendu sa décision. Les demandeurs, ajoute-t-il, ne sont pas autorisés à produire de nouveaux éléments de preuve dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire, si ce n'est pour régler des questions d'équité procédurale ou de compétence:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 38;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Il soutient que ces exceptions ne s'appliquent pas en l'espèce et qu'il convient donc de radier les éléments de preuve en question du dossier de demande. Je suis d'accord et, de ce fait, la Cour ne se fondera pas sur ces éléments de preuve additionnels.
LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[12]
Les questions en litige dans la présente demande sont les suivantes:
1) Était-il raisonnable pour le conseiller de conclure à une fausse déclaration?
2) Dans l'affirmative, était-il raisonnable pour le conseiller de conclure que cette fausse déclaration portait sur un fait important?
3) L'alinéa 40(1)
a
) exige-t-il que les demandeurs soient au courant de la fausse déclaration?
LA NORME DE CONTRÔLE APPLICABLE
[13]
L'existence d'une fausse déclaration est une question mixte de fait et de droit, et elle est donc susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la raisonnabilité:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 96, au paragraphe 14.
[14]
Le fait de savoir si l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) comporte un élément de connaissance est une question de droit liée à l'interprétation de la loi habilitante de l'agent et il est donc susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la raisonnabilité:
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 48:
[46] Voici ce qu'affirment les juges LeBel et Cromwell au par. 22 des motifs dans
Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne)
:
D'autre part, la Cour réaffirme que les questions de droit générales qui revêtent une importance capitale pour le système juridique dans son ensemble
et
qui sont étrangères au domaine d'expertise de l'organisme juridictionnel demeurent assujetties à la norme de la décision correcte, et ce, dans un souci de cohérence de l'ordre juridique fondamental du pays. [Je souligne.]
En d'autres termes, depuis
Dunsmuir
, pour que s'applique la norme de la décision correcte, la question doit non seulement revêtir une
importance capitale pour le système juridique
, mais elle doit aussi être étrangère au
domaine d'expertise du décideur
.
[...]
[48] Pour le commissaire, interpréter le par. 50(5) de la
PIPA
revient à interpréter sa loi constitutive, relève de son expertise et ne soulève pas de questions de droit générales, ni de questions touchant véritablement à la compétence. Le contrôle de sa décision portant que la prorogation du délai après les 90 jours impartis ne met pas automatiquement fin à l'enquête
doit donc s'effectuer selon la norme de la raisonnabilité
. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
ANALYSE
Première question
Était-il raisonnable pour le conseiller de conclure à une fausse déclaration?
[15]
Les demandeurs font valoir qu'il n'y a pas eu de fausse déclaration, car le faux document n'était manifestement pas le résultat d'un test. Ce document ressemble à un compte rendu de test IELTS, mais il y est dit qu'il est [traduction] « simplement un document interne ». Une personne raisonnable ne pourrait donc pas conclure qu'il s'agit d'un compte rendu de test IELTS, de sorte qu'il n'y a eu aucune fausse déclaration.
[16]
Le défendeur fait valoir que le faux document a été clairement conçu pour amener les autorités de l'immigration à croire faussement qu'il s'agissait d'un compte rendu de test IELTS. Il y a donc manifestement eu fausse déclaration.
[17]
La Cour convient avec le défendeur que le faux document constitue une fausse déclaration: un examen de l'aspect physique de ce document révèle qu'il est clairement conçu pour imiter l'aspect d'un compte rendu de test IELTS. Il n'y a pas de raison plausible pour laquelle le faux document a été produit, si ce n'est que pour amener les autorités de l'Immigration à croire faussement que le dossier est complet et que la demanderesse principale répond aux exigences linguistiques. Un agent vérifiant initialement l'intégralité du dossier ne constaterait pas forcément que ce document est faux. Je ne crois pas qu'une personne raisonnable pourrait dire que ce document visait une fin autre que celle d'induire en erreur. Il était donc parfaitement raisonnable pour le conseiller de conclure que ce document visait à amener les autorités à croire faussement qu'il s'agissait d'un résultat de test authentique.
Deuxième question
Dans l'affirmative, était-il raisonnable pour le conseiller de conclure que cette fausse déclaration portait sur un fait important?
[18]
Les demandeurs font valoir subsidiairement que, s'il y a eu fausse déclaration, celle-ci ne portait pas sur un fait important. Ils invoquent le Guide d'exécution de la loi de CIC, le Guide ENF 2, intitulé
Évaluation de l'interdiction de territoire
, où il est indiqué qu'une fausse déclaration ne doit être considérée comme importante que si elle a une incidence sur le processus amorcé. Étant donné que seuls doivent être pris en compte les résultats du test linguistique le plus récent, le faux document n'aurait pas pu avoir une incidence sur ce processus.
[19]
Les demandeurs se fondent sur la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  une affaire dans laquelle le demandeur avait fait une fausse déclaration en produisant un faux document, mais où la Cour a conclu que cette fausse déclaration ne se rapportait pas à un fait important.
[20]
Les demandeurs sont d'avis que la présente affaire est semblable aux affaires
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA): dans ces deux affaires, l'agent des visas avait mal renseigné les demandeurs sur le motif des doutes concernant la fausse déclaration. En l'espèce, les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agent les a induits en erreur dans la lettre d'équité, en disant qu'ils avaient produit un compte rendu de test IELTS non vérifiable - comme le faux document n'était manifestement pas un résultat de test, il s'agissait d'une information inexacte.
[21]
Les demandeurs soutiennent par ailleurs que l'agent a commis une erreur en concluant que leur réponse à la lettre d'équité était invraisemblable - comme leur consultant avait été dénué à ce point de scrupule qu'il avait falsifié le résultat d'un test linguistique, il était déraisonnable de conclure qu'il ne falsifierait pas également le formulaire dans lequel les demandeurs reconnaissaient censément avoir présenté ces résultats.
[22]
Le défendeur soutient que les observations des demandeurs sur l'importance du fait sont contraires au libellé de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la Loi - à l'époque où le faux document a été produit, il s'agissait de la seule preuve des compétences linguistiques de la demanderesse principale. Si ce document n'avait pas été produit, la demande aurait été considérée comme incomplète et renvoyée. C'est donc dire que la fausse déclaration a eu une incidence sur le processus amorcé, et elle portait sur un fait important:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Je suis d'accord, et ce, pour les motifs qui suivent.
[23]
Pour décider si une fausse déclaration est importante, il est nécessaire de tenir compte du libellé de la disposition ainsi que de l'objet qui la sous-tend.
[24]
Il convient d'interpréter l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de manière large afin de faire ressortir l'objet qui le sous-tend:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Cette disposition a pour objectif de dissuader de faire une fausse déclaration et de préserver l'intégrité du processus d'immigration -pour atteindre cet objectif, il incombe au demandeur de vérifier l'intégralité et l'exactitude de sa demande. L'alinéa 40(1)
a
) est libellé de manière large en vue d'englober les présentations erronées, même si elles ont été faites par une tierce partie, à l'insu du demandeur:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 56. Le demandeur ne peut pas faire une présentation erronée sur un fait important ni une réticence sur ce fait si cela risque d'entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la Loi.
[25]
Dans la présente affaire, le fait auquel se rapporte la fausse déclaration avait trait à la question de savoir si la demanderesse principale avait passé un test d'anglais IELTS. Il est indubitable que ce fait était important pour sa demande - dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral), les demandeurs doivent faire la preuve de leurs compétences linguistiques pour être admis. Aussitôt qu'il a été produit, le faux document aurait pu entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la Loi, parce qu'un décideur aurait pu s'y fier pour conclure que la demanderesse principale avait fait la preuve de ses compétences linguistiques.
[26]
Je conviens avec le défendeur que, pour se rapport à un fait important, une fausse déclaration n'a pas à être décisive ou déterminante. Il suffit qu'elle ait une incidence sur le processus amorcé. Le faux document était donc manifestement important, car, sans lui, la demande n'aurait pas pu être traitée.
[27]
Le fait que l'on ait découvert la fausse déclaration avant l'appréciation définitive de la demande n'aide pas la cause des demandeurs. L'analyse de l'importance ne se limite pas à un moment particulier au cours du traitement de la demande - le fait que la demanderesse principale a produit des résultats de test plus récents n'amoindrit pas l'importance de la fausse déclaration antérieure. Un tel résultat refléterait une compréhension restreinte de l'importance du fait qui va à l'encontre du libellé et de l'objet de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la Loi. Le faux document a été produit, et il avait trait à un fait important.
[28]
Il y a lieu de faire une distinction entre la présente affaire et la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée: dans cette dernière, le faux document n'était pas pertinent pour trancher la demande. En l'espèce, les résultats du test de langue sont manifestement pertinents pour la demande en litige. La décision rendue dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> peut être distinguée elle aussi de la présente l'espèce: dans cette affaire, l'agent avait été informé par erreur qu'une lettre confirmant le diplôme du demandeur avait été falsifiée - des éléments de preuve additionnels ont prouvé que le diplôme lui-même était authentique. Dans le cas présent, le « test » dont le faux document indique censément les résultats n'a jamais eu lieu et, de ce fait, le raisonnement énoncé dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ne s'applique pas.
[29]
Je suis donc d'avis que l'agent des visas a conclu de manière raisonnable que le faux document constituait une présentation erronée sur un fait important au sens de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la Loi.
Troisième question
L'alinéa 40(1)
a
) exige-t-il que les demandeurs soient au courant de la fausse déclaration?
[30]
Selon les demandeurs, pour être déclarée interdite de territoire au sens de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la Loi, une partie doit avoir été animée d'une intention subjective, c'est-à-dire qu'elle doit avoir eu connaissance de la fausse déclaration.
[31]
Les demandeurs citent la décision récente du juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), où cette question a été analysée. Dans cette affaire, la demanderesse avait été déclarée interdite de territoire par Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (CIC) en application de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
), parce qu'elle avait inscrit son époux en tant que père de ses deux enfants, alors qu'en fait celui-ci était le père biologique de l'un des deux seulement. Le couple s'était séparé brièvement près de trente ans plus tôt et, durant cette séparation, la demanderesse avait eu une aventure unique avec un autre homme. Le couple s'était ensuite réconcilié et ni l'un ni l'autre n'avait soupçonné que l'époux n'était pas le père de l'enfant en question. Ce fait n'avait été mis en lumière que lorsqu'un agent de CIC avait ordonné un test d'ADN. Malgré l'absence de connaissance de la demanderesse, cette dernière avait été déclarée interdite de territoire pour fausses déclarations en vertu de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
).
[32]
En procédant au contrôle judiciaire de cette décision, le juge Hughes a passé en revue une série d'affaires confirmant une conclusion de fausse déclaration et il a fait remarquer que celles-ci contenaient toutes un élément de
mens rea
, ou d'intention subjective. Il a conclu qu'étant donné que les demandeurs, dans la décision dont il était saisi, n'avaient aucune raison de croire qu'ils faisaient une présentation erronée sur un fait important, il était déraisonnable de les déclarer interdits de territoire pour ce motif. Il a certifié une question sur ce point, mais le défendeur n'a pas porté l'affaire en appel.
[33]
Je conclus que la décision rendue dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> n'est d'aucune utilité pour les demandeurs en l'espèce. Cette décision était subordonnée à un ensemble fort inusité de faits et on ne peut l'invoquer à l'appui de la thèse générale selon laquelle une fausse déclaration exige dans tous les cas un élément de connaissance subjective. La règle générale est plutôt la suivante: une fausse déclaration peut être faite à l'insu du demandeur, ainsi que l'a fait remarquer le juge Russell dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 35:
[35] En ce qui concerne l'interdiction de territoire pour fausses déclarations, la Cour a déjà donné une interprétation libérale et solide de l'article 40. Dans
Khan
, précitée, le juge O'Keefe a statué que le libellé de la Loi doit être respecté et qu'il faut donner de l'article 40 l'interprétation large que son libellé exige. Il a dit aussi que l'article 40 s'applique lorsque le demandeur adopte une fausse déclaration, mais la clarifie ensuite avant qu'une décision soit rendue.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour a statué que l'article 40 s'applique à un demandeur lorsque la fausse déclaration a été faite par une autre partie à la demande et que le demandeur ignorait cette fausse déclaration
. La Cour a affirmé qu'une lecture initiale de l'article 40 n'étayait pas cette interprétation, mais que la disposition devait être interprétée de cette façon pour éviter un résultat absurde. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
Quelques décisions prévoient une exception étroite à cette règle, mais cette exception ne s'appliquera qu'aux
circonstances véritablement exceptionnelles
dans lesquelles le demandeur croyait honnêtement et
raisonnablement
qu'il ne faisait pas une présentation erronée sur un fait important.
[34]
Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Hughes cite la décision rendue par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Dans cette affaire, le demandeur avait été déclaré interdit de territoire pour fausses déclarations, parce qu'il n'avait pas révélé l'existence d'un enfant qu'il aurait dû, comme la Commission l'avait conclu, soupçonner raisonnablement être le sien. (Il convient de souligner que, à l'instar des demandeurs en l'espèce, il a été conclu que ce demandeur n'était pas digne de foi.) Le juge Harrington a envisagé de certifier une question semblable à celle posée dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, mais il a conclu que la décision était déraisonnable pour d'autres motifs.
[35]
Le passage de la décision
Singh
auquel le juge Hughes fait référence contient au paragraphe 20 un extrait souvent cité de la décision du juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[15] Aux termes de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la LIPR, une personne est interdite de territoire au Canada si elle fait une réticence sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ce qui entraîne ou risque d'entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la Loi. Defaçon générale, un demandeur de la résidence permanente est soumis à une« obligation de franchise » qui l'oblige à révéler les faits importants. Ce devoir s'étend aux variations possibles de la situation personnelle du demandeur, y compris un changement d'état matrimonial:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.) (QL). Même une omission innocente de fournir des renseignements importants peut mener à une conclusion d'interdiction de territoire; par exemple, la demanderesse qui omet d'inclure la totalité de ses enfants dans sa demande peut être interdite de territoire:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.) (QL).
Il y a toutefois une exception si les demandeurs peuvent montrer qu'ils croyaient honnêtement et raisonnablement ne pas dissimuler des renseignements importants
:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.) (QL). [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[36]
Même si elle est souvent citée, l'« exception » dont il est question dans l'extrait qui précède est peu appliquée. L'affaire dont elle tire son origine, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, mettait en cause un ensemble inusité de faits: la demanderesse était parrainée par son époux, mais, à son insu, l'époux avait retiré son parrainage. Les fonctionnaires canadiens avaient ensuite induit la demanderesse en erreur en lui demandant de renvoyer le visa qui, disaient-ils, contenait une erreur. Ils avaient laissé entendre qu'il lui serait renvoyé, après avoir été rectifié. La demanderesse avait demandé à des membres de sa famille qui parlaient l'anglais d'examiner le visa et, après que ceux-ci lui avaient assuré qu'il était en ordre, elle s'en était servie pour entrer au Canada. La Commission d'appel de l'immigration a conclu qu'elle était une personne décrite à l'alinéa 27(1)
e
) de l'ancienne
Loi sur l'immigration
, 1976 LC 1976-77, c 52 [aujourd'hui LRC 1985, c I-2], c'est-à-dire qu'elle avait « obtenu le droit d'établissement [...] par des moyens frauduleux ou irréguliers ». Cette conclusion a été infirmée par la Cour d'appel fédérale, parce que la demanderesse avait eu « des motifs raisonnables de croire » qu'elle ne cachait pas de renseignements connexes à son admission.
[37]
Quand on la considère dans son contexte factuel, l'exception formulée dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> est donc assez étroite. Comme l'a fait remarquer le juge MacKay en faisant une distinction entre cette affaire-là et celle dont il était saisi, soit
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
41 On peut également établir une distinction entre les faits de la présente espèce et ceux de l'affaire Medel, au motif que le renseignement que le requérant n'a pas communiqué n'était pas un renseignement dont il n'était véritablement et subjectivement pas au courant. En l'espèce, le requérant savait bien qu'il était marié.
Et il ne s'agissait pas, comme dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , d'un renseignement dont la connaissance échappait à sa volonté
. Il ne s'agissait pas d'un renseignement qu'on lui avait dissimulé ou au sujet duquel il avait été induit en erreur par les fonctionnaires de l'ambassade. La présumée ignorance du requérant en ce qui concerne l'obligation de signaler un tel changement important survenu dans son état matrimonial et son incapacité de communiquer ce renseignement à son arrivée à un agent d'immigration ne constituent pas, selon moi, une "ignorance subjective" de renseignements importants au sens de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . [Non souligné dans l'original.]
Par ailleurs, je souligne qu'il y avait, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , un facteur déterminant: la demanderesse avait eu
des motifs raisonnables de croire
qu'elle ne cachait pas de renseignements aux autorités canadiennes. Par contraste, en l'espèce, les demandeurs n'ont pas agi de manière raisonnable - la demanderesse principale n'a pas examiné sa demande pour s'assurer de son exactitude.
[38]
Il convient de garder à l'esprit que les étrangers qui cherchent à entrer au Canada ont une obligation de franchise:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Comme il est dit au paragraphe 16(1) de la Loi: « [l'] auteur d'une demande au titre de la présente loi doit répondre véridiquement aux questions qui lui sont posées lors du contrôle, donner les renseignements et tous les éléments de preuve pertinents et présenter les visa et documents requis ».
[39]
Ainsi qu'il est indiqué dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (au paragraphe 44):
[...] L'objectif de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) de la Loi est de veiller à ce que les demandeurs fournissent des renseignements complets, fidèles et véridiques en tout point lorsqu'ils présentent une demande d'entrée au  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) et les faits en l'espèce constituaient bien plus qu'un simple silence.
[40]
De pair avec cette obligation de franchise, la demanderesse est tenue, selon moi, de s'assurer qu'au moment de présenter sa demande les documents sont complets et exacts. Il est trop facile de prétendre plus tard qu'on est innocent et de jeter le blâme sur une tierce partie quand, comme c'est le cas en l'espèce, le formulaire de demande indique
clairement
que les résultats du test de langue doivent y être joints et que les demandeurs l'ont signé. Ce n'est que dans les cas exceptionnels où un demandeur peut démontrer qu'il croyait honnêtement et
raisonnablement
ne pas cacher des renseignements importants « dont la connaissance échappait à sa volonté » qu'il peut se prévaloir d'une exception à l'application de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
). Ce n'est pas le cas en l'espèce.
[41]
Les demandeurs prétendent qu'ils n'avaient aucune connaissance de la fausse déclaration et ils souhaitent s'exonérer de toute responsabilité en jetant le blâme sur leur consultant en immigration. En fait, ils prétendent n'avoir même pas vu l'exemplaire de leurs formulaires de demande qui a été présenté et ils soutiennent essentiellement que le caractère frauduleux de ce consultant devrait constituer un moyen de défense contre l'application de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
).
[42]
En réponse à cet argument, je suis d'avis que les commentaires qu'a faits le juge Mosley dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> sont instructifs:
[16] Le demandeur se trouvait au Bangladesh lorsque la demande mise à jour a été soumise. Il a reconnu lors d'une conversation téléphonique, le 26 mai, qu'il [traduction] « aurait pu signer un formulaire vierge pour le consultant ». Le nouveau formulaire renfermait d'autres contradictions. Apparemment, le demandeur s'en est remis au consultant pour fournir les renseignements nécessaires sans en vérifier personnellement l'exactitude.
En l'espèce, les demandeurs ont décidé de s'en remettre à leur consultant. La demanderesse principale prétend qu'on ne lui a pas donné l'occasion d'examiner sa demande. Il serait contraire à l'obligation de franchise imposée aux demandeurs de permettre à la demanderesse principale de faire maintenant valoir qu'elle n'a pas examiné sa propre demande. C'était à elle qu'il incombait de veiller à ce que sa demande soit véridique et complète - elle a fait preuve de négligence dans l'exécution de cette obligation.
[43]
Par ailleurs, pour que les demandeurs puissent se fonder sur un « moyen de défense » contre la conclusion de fausse déclaration, il faut que ce moyen soit ancré soit dans une loi, soit dans la common law. Selon moi, il n'existe dans la Loi aucune défense de cette nature: le libellé de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) est suffisamment large pour englober les fausses déclarations que fait une autre partie, à l'insu du demandeur:
Wang
, précitée, aux paragraphes 55 et 56. De plus, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, la Cour a conclu que le fait qu'un consultant en immigration était à blâmer pour la fausse déclaration ne constituait pas un moyen de défense. Comme nous l'avons déjà vu, les demandeurs ne peuvent se prévaloir de l'exception relative à une erreur commise en toute innocence.
[44]
En outre, je ne conclus pas qu'il existe un moyen de défense applicable en common law. Les demandeurs ont eu droit au respect de l'équité procédurale, mais ce droit était restreint et il a été respecté en l'espèce: ils ont reçu la lettre d'équité leur faisant part des doutes de l'agent au sujet du faux document et ils ont eu 30 jours pour y répondre. La réponse des demandeurs à la lettre d'équité a été un bref courriel de la part de leur nouveau consultant, disant qu'ils avaient été dupés par leur consultant précédent et demandant qu'ils ne soient pas punis à cause des gestes de ce dernier.
[45]
Comme le montrent les notes du STIDI, l'agent a pris en compte cette réponse, mais il a conclu qu'elle était indigne de foi, parce que le formulaire de demande indiquait clairement que les résultats du test de langue y étaient joints et que les demandeurs l'avaient signé. La Cour est d'avis qu'il était raisonnablement loisible à l'agent de tirer cette conclusion, celui-ci n'ayant à sa disposition que la simple allégation des demandeurs selon laquelle ils avaient été dupés. Ces derniers n'ont fourni aucune preuve au soutien de leur allégation d'innocence à l'égard de la fausse déclaration, et l'agent n'était pas tenu de se renseigner davantage si la réponse des demandeurs à la lettre d'équité était déficiente:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Comme l'a déclaré le juge Crampton (aujourd'hui juge en chef de la Cour): « [i] mposer de telles contraintes à l'agent des visas reviendrait à lui demander de donner avis préalable d'une décision défavorable, obligation qui a été explicitement écartée (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL);
Sharma
, précitée) » (
ibidem
, au paragraphe 28). Rien d'autre ne permet maintenant aux demandeurs de tenter de nouveau de prouver qu'ils ont été dupés et qu'ils n'ont donc pas à être déclarés interdits de territoire.
[46]
Les demandeurs se fondent sur la décision rendue dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à l'appui de la thèse selon laquelle la négligence d'un avocat (ou, en l'espèce, le geste frauduleux d'un consultant) ne devrait pas causer préjudice au demandeur qui a agi avec diligence. Cependant, comme nous l'avons déjà vu, dans la présente affaire, les demandeurs n'ont pas agi avec diligence - ils n'ont pas assumé la responsabilité du contenu de leur demande, et ils n'ont pas passé cette dernière en revue avant de la présenter. Il ne suffit pas d'omettre de faire preuve de diligence et, ensuite, une fois qu'on s'est fait prendre, de plaider l'ignorance. Les demandeurs ne peuvent donc pas invoquer le raisonnement exposé dans cette affaire pour se défendre contre la conclusion de fausses déclarations.
[47]
Par ailleurs, il me semble que, quand un consultant, comme c'est le cas en l'espèce, fournit des renseignements qui ne coïncident pas avec les instructions qui accompagnent une demande, il faudrait que la demanderesse soit consciente de la possibilité que les conseils de ce consultant ne soient peut-être pas exacts et qu'elle vérifie les dires de ce dernier auprès des fonctionnaires compétents.
[48]
Les demandeurs font valoir que l'agent des visas ne s'est pas acquitté de l'obligation de diligence qu'exigeait la situation. Ils laissent entendre que le faux document aurait dû être immédiatement renvoyé dès sa réception, parce qu'il s'agissait manifestement d'une copie, et non d'un original. Leur argument semble être une tentative pour dissocier l'aspect frauduleux de ce document de ses autres lacunes - c'est-à-dire que l'agent des visas aurait dû d'abord se rendre compte que le faux document était une copie, et non un original, et qu'ensuite, au lieu de l'examiner plus en détail, il aurait fallu qu'il le renvoie immédiatement aux demandeurs et demande plutôt un original.
[49]
Le concept de l'obligation de diligence ne s'applique pas dans ce contexte-ci - les
demandeurs
étaient soumis à une obligation de franchise, et ils ne s'en sont pas acquittés. Le premier agent de contrôle avait simplement pour tâche de vérifier l'« intégralité » du dossier de demande. Il n'avait aucune« obligation de diligence » envers les demandeurs.
[50]
Les exigences en matière d'équité procédurale - qui existaient effectivement - ont bien été remplies. Quand l'agent des visas a plus tard examiné le document en question, il a noté que celui-ci présentait plusieurs problèmes (dont, vraisemblablement, le fait qu'il s'agissait à l'évidence d'une copie), ce qui l'a amené à conclure qu'il était faux. À ce stade, l'obligation de l'agent des visas consistait à aviser les demandeurs qu'ils risquaient d'être interdits de territoire pour fausses déclarations. Il s'en est acquitté en leur envoyant la lettre d'équité et il a donc satisfait aux exigences en matière d'équité procédurale.
[51]
La Cour reconnaît que le problème des consultants en immigration frauduleux est sérieux. Cependant, ce problème ne constitue pas un
moyen de défense
contre l'application de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
). En outre, sous réserve de l'exception étroite dont il a été question plus tôt, la Cour a systématiquement conclu qu'un demandeur peut être interdit de territoire au sens de l'alinéa 40(1)
a
) pour de fausses déclarations faites à son insu par une autre personne. L'article 40 ne peut donc clairement pas comporter une obligation quelconque de connaissance ou d'intention subjective: cela serait contraire à l'interprétation large qu'imposent le libellé et l'objet de cette disposition.
[52]
La demande doit donc être rejetée.
Question certifiée
[53]
La demanderesse a soumis la question qui suit à la Cour pour qu'elle la certifie:
[Traduction]
La présentation erronée sur un fait important emporte-t-elle interdiction de territoire si, au moment où il présente sa demande de résidence permanente ou au moment où il obtient le statut de résident permanent, l'étranger n'a aucune connaissance du fait important auquel a trait la présentation erronée?
[54]
Le défendeur soutient qu'il n'y a pas lieu de certifier une question en l'espèce, car il y aurait un trop grand nombre de conclusions factuelles à présumer en faveur des demandeurs. Cependant, si la Cour ne souscrit pas à ses observations sur ce point, il est d'avis qu'il faudrait certifier cette question-ci:
[Traduction]
Lorsqu'une documentation est soumise à l'appui d'un formulaire dedemande signé de résidence permanente au Canada, mais que le demandeur affirme ultérieurement qu'il n'a aucune connaissance de la documentation soumise ou d'une partie de celle-ci, demeure-t-il responsable de la véracité de toute la documentation soumise à l'appui aux fins de l'application de l'alinéa 40(1)a) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27, dans sa version modifiée?
[55]
Pour qu'une question puisse être certifiée, il faut qu'elle découle de l'affaire dont la Cour est saisie et qu'elle soulève une question de droit de portée générale que la Cour fédérale n'a pas déjà tranchée:

JUGEMENT
[56]
LA COUR ORDONNE
:
1. la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée;
2. aucune question de portée générale n'est certifiée.

 I.  
 Introduction 
 
 
 
 [1] 
   
 Fothergill, J. 
 : Uthayapalan Thanabalasingam, Sivapalan Thanabalasingam and Tharmapalan Thanabalasingam (collectively the Applicants) have brought an application for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division (the Board or RPD) dated February 4, 2014. The Board concluded that the Applicants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to ss 96 or 97(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 (the IRPA). The determinative issues were the Applicants' credibility and whether they had a well-founded  
 sur place 
  claim. 
 
 
 
 [2] 
  For the reasons that follow, the application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is remitted to the Board for re-determination by a different member of the RPD. 
 
 
 
 II.  
 Background 
 
 
 
 [3] 
  The Applicants are Tamil brothers from the island of Pungudutivu in the Jaffna Province in northern Sri Lanka. They claim to fear persecution by Sri Lankan State security agents and paramilitary groups due to their perceived political affiliation with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE or Tamil Tigers). 
 
 
 
 [4] 
  Two of the Applicants, Sivapalan and Tharmapalan, arrived in Canada aboard the ship MV  
 Sun Sea 
  in August 2010. The MV  
 Sun Sea 
 , which carried approximately 494 Sri Lankan ethnic Tamils, was widely reported to be owned and operated by the Tamil Tigers, and its arrival in Canada received significant domestic and international media attention. Uthayapalan travelled to Canada in 2010 circuitously by land and by airplane via the United States and several South American countries. He sought asylum in the U.S. but left the country before any final determination of his claim was made. On July 25, 2010 he initiated a refugee claim in Canada. The Applicants were all placed in immigration detention in Fraser, British Columbia, pending an inquiry into their identities, motives for travelling to Canada, security checks and a broader investigation of the MV  
 Sun Sea 
 . 
 
 
 
 [5] 
  The Applicants made a number of assertions before the Board with respect to their past persecution in Sri Lanka. The Board found these assertions not to be credible and this conclusion is not challenged by the Applicants in this proceeding. 
 
 
 
 III.  
 The Board's Decision 
 
 
 
 [6] 
  In addition to finding the Applicants not to be credible with respect to their allegations of past persecution in Sri Lanka (Decision at para 157), the Board also rejected their  
 sur place 
  claim. A  
 sur place 
  refugee is defined in the United Nations  
 Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status 
  (the UNHCR Handbook) as a person "who was not a refugee when he left his country, but who becomes a refugee at a later date." The UNHCR Handbook describes two situations in which a  
 sur place 
  claim may arise: (1) a change in circumstances in the country of origin during the person's absence, or (2) as a result of a person's own actions such as associating with refugees already recognized or expressing political views in the new country of residence. 
 
 
 
 [7] 
  In its  
 sur place 
  analysis (paras 180-190 of the Decision), the Board found that there was no credible, persuasive evidence that the Government of Sri Lanka suspects individuals of having links to the LTTE solely by virtue of their having been smuggled to Canada aboard the MV  
 Sun Sea 
 . The Board acknowledged that the arrival of the MV  
 Sun Sea 
  in Canada attracted significant publicity, and that the Sri Lankan authorities may learn that two of the Applicants travelled aboard it. The Board nevertheless concluded that the three Applicants have little or no profile with the Sri Lankan authorities, and they would not now be of interest to the authorities simply because of their connection to the MV  
 Sun Sea 
 . 
 
 
 
 IV.  
 Issue 
 
 
 
 [8] 
  The central issue in this application for judicial review is whether the Board's assessment of the Applicants'  
 sur place 
  claim was reasonable. 
 
 
 
 V.  
 Analysis 
 
 
 
 [9] 
  The Board's assessment of a  
 sur place 
  claim is reviewable against a standard of reasonableness:  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
 [10] 
  Since early 2010, this Court has considered a large number of applications for judicial review brought by persons arriving in Canada aboard the MV  
 Sun Sea 
  and its sister ship the MV  
 Ocean Lady 
 . These claims have generally required a  
 sur place 
  analysis. Claimants allege that, regardless of their actual affiliation with the LTTE, their profile changed once they boarded the MV  
 Sun Sea 
  or MV  
 Ocean Lady 
 . 
 
 
 
 [11] 
  There has been considerable variation in the determination of these  
 sur place 
  claims by both the Board and this Court. Presumably this is because each decision is based on (sometimes subtly) different facts and evolving reports of country conditions in Sri Lanka. As Justice Locke noted in  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 
 [12] 
  It is possible for the Board to either accept or reject a  
 sur place 
  claim by a passenger aboard the MV  
 Sun Sea 
  or MV  
 Ocean Lady 
 , and for the Board's decision to be upheld by this Court as reasonable. However, it is an error for the Board to engage in a selective analysis of the documentary evidence and to ignore contradictory evidence without providing a reasonable explanation:  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
 [13] 
  In this case, the Board acknowledged that the Sri Lankan authorities would likely discover that two of the Applicants had travelled aboard the MV  
 Sun Sea 
 . There was evidence before the Board that failed asylum-seekers undergo several hours of questioning and security interviews by the State Intelligence Service upon their return (for example, National Documentation Package document #1.13, "UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Sri Lanka", December 21, 2012 (the Guidelines)). The Board referred to the Guidelines, but neglected to mention references therein to reports that failed asylum-seekers, particularly those who are Tamil, have been detained, ill-treated or tortured after being forcibly returned to Sri Lanka (the Guidelines at page 8; Certified Tribunal Record at page 267). 
 
 
 
 [14] 
  The Board was also provided with a report titled "Amnesty International Concerns with respect to forced returns to Sri Lanka for passengers of the Ocean Lady and MV Sun Sea" (Certified Tribunal Record at page 635) (the AI Report). The AI Report concluded that failed asylum claimants face a serious risk of detention, torture and mistreatment if the Sri Lankan government suspects that they travelled on the MV  
 Sun Sea 
 . 
 
 
 
 [15] 
  Nevertheless, the Board stated the following: 
 
 
 
 [182] I find, however, that no credible, persuasive evidence has been proffered that the Government of Sri Lanka suspects individuals as having links to the LTTE by virtue of having been smuggled to Canada aboard a ship allegedly owned and operated by the LTTE. Although Sri Lankan authorities may come to know how the claimants, Sivapalan and Tharmapalan, came to Canada, the panel has considered if, in fact, those two claimants face an increased risk of persecution by having travelled aboard the M.V.  
 Sun Sea 
 , or if their brother, Uthayapalan, faces an increased risk because they did so. 
 
 
 
 [16] 
  In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, a case that bears a marked resemblance to this one, Justice Russell wrote: 
 
 
 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED 
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 [17] 
  Both Justice Russell in  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED 
  and Justice Strickland in  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED emphasized the AI Report in assessing the  
 sur place 
  claims of asylum-seekers who travelled on the MV  
 Sun Sea 
 . In  
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED 
 , Justice Strickland found that the failure of the Board to explain why it discounted the AI Report rendered its decision unreasonable FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. Similarly in this case, the Board's failure to explain why it discounted the AI Report and other contradictory evidence renders its decision unreasonable. 
 
 
 
 [18] 
  Finally, I am unpersuaded by the Board's reassurance that: 
 
 
 
 ... all three claimants could produce documentation, including the Immigration and Refugee Board's decisions in their joined claims, to indicate that each and every one of them has been found not to have any association with the LTTE. Thus, in my view, the fact that Sivapalan and Tharmapalan have been subjected to rigorous scrutiny by Canadian officials and been subsequently released, may very well place all three in a better light should any or all of them be returned to Sri Lanka. 
 
 
 
 [19] 
  I agree with the Applicants that this is unwarranted speculation. As Justice de Montigny wrote in  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED: 
 
 
 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 
 VI.  
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
 [20] 
  For the foregoing reasons, the application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is remitted to the Board for re-determination by a different member of the RPD. 
 
 
 
 JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 [21] 
   
 THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that 
  the application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is remitted to the Board for re-determination by a different member of the Refugee Protection Division. 
 
 
 
 Application allowed.

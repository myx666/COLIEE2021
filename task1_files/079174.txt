I. Introduction
[1]
Annis, J.
: The applicant seeks judicial review of an October 29, 2012 decision by a Senior Immigration Officer rejecting his second Pre-Removal Risk Assessment [PRRA] application. For the reasons which follow, the application is dismissed.
II. The Facts
[2]
Mr. Bicuku was born in a mountain village in Albania in 1975, one of four children. His parents' marriage was an arranged one. Unbeknownst to his parents, Mr. Bicuku had sexual relationships with two local women starting when he was twenty-one. When he was twenty-six, his father announced to him that he had been betrothed to Mhill Kola's daughter when he and she were both children. He went to meet Ms. Kola, but she "had motor difficulties and she was constantly shaking. She did not make eye contact and smiled uncontrollable [
sic
], not in a happy kind of way, but in a not fully present way, a vacant way." Mr. Bicuku declined to marry her.
[3]
The applicant's father insisted. The applicant repeatedly refused to marry Ms. Kola and sought help from local elders. The two fathers did not accept this and eventually Mr. Bicuku's father informed him that he was bringing Ms. Kola to their house and that with or without a ceremony, the two would be man and wife. Mr. Bicuku fled to Tirana and from there to Canada. He states that he went to the Albanian police but they would not help because it was a blood feud matter and they did not want to get involved.
[4]
He arrived in Canada on July 26, 2002. He requested asylum on the basis that his refusal to marry the woman selected as his bride had sparked a blood feud against his family. The Refugee Protection Division [RPD] rejected his claim (and his accompanying brother's claim) on March 23, 2004, citing credibility as the determinative issue. Judicial review was denied on June 24, 2004. A PRRA application was rejected on July 23, 2008 and Mr. Bicuku left Canada on November 22, 2008 and returned to Albania.
[5]
He states that when he returned to Albania, he told no one that he was back. He lived and worked in Bathore, near the capital city, for two years. In November 2010, individuals associated with Mr. Kola ambushed him as he made his way home from work. They beat him up again a month and a half later, again two months later, and again a few months after that, demanding that he keep his father's promise to marry Ms. Kola. In June 2011, he moved. However, they found him again and kidnapped him in November 2011, bringing him to a tent by a river where they kept him in isolation overnight, then told him to marry Ms. Kola or face his death. These individuals then dumped him by the side of the road.
[6]
The applicant fled to Montenegro and Bosnia during unspecified dates but could not work in those countries and did not think he would be recognized as a refugee by any European country.
[7]
Mr. Bicuku re-entered Canada on a false passport on December 9, 2011. He was charged and convicted of unlawfully entering the country pursuant to 124(1)(
a
) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] and was sentenced to 155 days' imprisonment.
[8]
He was not eligible for another RPD hearing (IRPA section 101: (1) A claim is ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division if . . . (b) a claim for refugee protection by the claimant has been rejected by the Board.) He applied for another PRRA and this second PRRA application was heard based on the new evidence arising since July 2008.
III. Contested Decision
[9]
The PRRA officer reviewed Mr. Bicuku's situation. He or she noted that Mr. Bicuku had presented as new evidence an Immigration and Refugee Board [IRB] issue paper dated May 2008; articles dated July 1, 2010, July 5, 2011, May 18, 2011, February 10, 2012, March 24, 2012, and July 25, 2012; a Freedom House report on human rights dated 2011; letters from his mother, brother, cousin, and a friend dated between May 1, 2012 and July 10, 2012; and an affidavit by the applicant himself dated May 14, 2012.
[10]
The affidavits from the brother, cousin, and friend recounted what the applicant had told them, and were thus given little weight. The affidavit from the mother discussed the blood feud with the Kola family, but the information about attacks on Mr. Bicuku was based on what he had told her and there was no information about any harm inflicted on any other member of the family in over ten years. The PRRA officer thus gave this letter little weight as well.
[11]
The PRRA officer noted that the applicant, according to his affidavit, never reported any of the attacks to the authorities and made no attempts to end the feud through any of the available reconciliation committees. He also left Albania twice in 2011 but did not seek protection. The PRRA officer commented that both Montenegro and Bosnia do grant asylum to refugees. His affidavit was therefore given little weight.
[12]
After a careful review of the country documentation, the PRRA officer commented that while he or she gave this evidence some weight in establishing the existence of blood feuds in Albania, the applicant had not demonstrated that he was engaged in a blood feud with the Kola family. The officer therefore gave this evidence little weight for establishing personalized risk to the applicant.
[13]
The PRRA officer recognized that certain human rights issues remained a concern in Albania but found that the objective documentation did not establish a forward-looking risk that was personal to the applicant. The Albanian state, while experiencing problems with corruption and police impunity, was functioning and the applicant had not provided clear and convincing evidence of its unwillingness or inability to protect him.
[14]
Finally, the PRRA officer noted that counsel for the applicant had requested that a hearing be held. However, the officer had not determined that the conditions in section 167 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 [IRPR] were present and therefore had not found an oral hearing to be required.
IV. Issues
[15]
The parties agreed at the hearing that the only issue was whether the PRRA officer was required to grant the applicant an interview because the evidence raised a serious credibility issue.
V. Standard of review
[16]
The jurisprudence on the standard of review for a decision on granting an oral hearing pursuant to section 167 of the IRPR and section 113 of the IRPA is mixed. In that regard, I cite Justice Yves de Montigny in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 24 as follows:
[24] The jurisprudence of this Court is divided on the standard of review for oral hearings under paragraph 113(b). I recently reviewed this question in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2012 FC 708, and I can do no better than repeat what I wrote there (at para 24):
That being said, there is a controversy in this Court as to the standard of review to be applied when reviewing an officer's decision not to convoke an oral hearing, particularly in the context of a PRRA decision. In some cases, the Court applied a correctness standard because the matter was viewed essentially as a matter of procedural fairness (see, for example,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2010 FC 253 (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2006 FC 1435 (available on CanLII)). On the other hand, the reasonableness [standard] was applied in other cases on the basis that the appropriateness of holding a hearing in light of a particular context of a file calls for discretion and commands deference (see, for example,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2010 FC 464 (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2010 FC 930, 374 FTR 160 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2011 FC 647 (available on CanLII) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). I agree with that second position, at least when the Court is reviewing a PRRA decision.
See also:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2011 FC 1277;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2012 FC 1294;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2012 FC 1305.
[17]
I adopt Justice de Montigny's reasoning that "the appropriateness of holding a hearing in light of a particular context of a file calls for discretion and commands deference". The standard of review is therefore reasonableness.
[18]
As additional comments on this issue, it is trite law that the standard of review reflects in large part the statutory regime governing the decision-makers' functions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> where the Court stated as follows:
The answer lies in
Dunsmuir's
recognition that reasonableness must be assessed in the
context of the particular type of decision making involved and all relevant factors
. It is an essentially contextual inquiry (
Dunsmuir
, at para. 64). As stated in
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 59,
per
Binnie J., "[r]easonableness is a single standard that takes its colour from the context." The fundamental question is the
scope
of decision-making power
conferred on the decision-maker by the governing legislation
. The scope of a body's decision-making power is determined by the type of case at hand.
[Emphasis added]
[19]
The legislative scheme has stipulated what should constitute a fair hearing in respect of an applicant's right to be heard in a PRRA application. Parliament has delegated responsibility for this task to the PRRA officer who acts as a kind of gatekeeper of the opportunity to have an interview as an aspect of the fairness requirements of the PRRA process. The officer is required to consider and weigh the evidence on credibility to determine whether it is sufficient to raise a serious credibility issue. The legislation thereby describes the function of an administrative decision-maker as one that attracts a standard of review of reasonableness even though it pertains to a tenet of fairness regarding the opportunity to be heard.
[20]
In a similar vein, I find the word "serious" to be a further determinant of the PRRA officer's function to support the reasonableness standard. The officer is required not only to determine whether there is evidence raising an issue of the applicant's credibility, but also to decide whether the evidence is of
sufficient
probative value to constitute a
serious
issue of credibility. This means that the officer is required in the first instance to review the evidence on credibility, not for the purpose of deciding whether the applicant is credible on a balance of probabilities, but whether it is sufficient to raise a serious issue of credibility such that an interview is required. The distinction is of some importance. Determining whether the evidence presents a serious credibility issue goes to the expertise of the tribunal in relation to the requirements of sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA. This exercise of discretion is a challenging one to which deference is owed.
A. Sufficiency of Credibility Evidence or a Credibility Determination?
[21]
The submissions of the applicant demonstrate the need to avoid mischaracterization of the PRRA Officer's reasons as evidence of a credibility finding, when it was an assessment of the credibility evidence to determine whether it was sufficient to raise a serious issue.
[22]
The determination of whether an interview is required is the second of three steps in the PRRA process. The first is to determine whether there is new evidence from that led before the RPD; the second whether an interview is necessary; and the third to decide the matter. The second step involves weighing the credibility evidence. This process necessarily gives rise to counterpoints that come to mind, such as in this case why the evidence failed to include mention of reporting the incidents to the authorities, or attempts made by the applicant to reconcile the blood feud via mechanisms established for this purpose by the state. The officer concluded that for the evidence to have a sufficient probative value to require interview, the evidentiary onus lay upon the applicant to either indicate that he had taken the steps one would reasonably expect to have been followed, or explain his failure to do so. As these obvious and important aspects of the applicant's evidence were missing, his evidence failed to raise a serious credibility issue.
[23]
The evidence of family members was equally lacking in weight to sustain a serious issue in regards to the applicant's credibility. It was comprised mostly of information communicated by the applicant, while the evidence directly from the family members themselves was of meager weight, such as a description of the applicant as demonstrating fear when relating his stories. None of the evidence was first hand observation or
res gestae
descriptions immediately following the events to support the applicant. It was of minimal probative value and raised no serious issue that contradicted the conclusion that the applicant could not make a serious case to sustain his story.
[24]
While these determinations can be described as making credibility findings, a finding of a lack of credibility occurs only
after
determining that an interview is not necessary. By concluding the credibility evidence lacks sufficient weight to constitute a "serious" issue, the
de facto
result is that the officer also rejects the evidence, i.e. makes an adverse credibility finding for its lack of probative value. The issue in this application, however, is whether an interview was required. This is an issue of insufficiency of evidence in terms of its weight, not a matter that was ultimately rejected on credibility grounds. Nevertheless, the decisions on the two issues cannot be separated.
[25]
It is only when the officer concludes that there is sufficient evidence attesting to a serious credibility issue that the third discrete step will be undertaken, after an interview, to determine whether the evidence is sufficiently reliable on a balance of probabilities to make a determination. The procedure is analogous to that followed by a judge in determining whether there is sufficient evidence to send the matter to the jury to determine the issue on the balance of probabilities. The applicant has in effect been non-suited on the credibility issue because the evidence had insufficient weight to reach the third step of the PRRA process.
B. The Applicant's Previous Adverse Credibility Finding
[26]
The jurisprudence on the requirement to conduct an interview appears to support a conclusion that reliance on, or even reference to, a previous adverse credibility conclusion against the applicant is a factor that the applicant may rely on to demonstrate that a serious credibility issue is raised requiring an interview.
[27]
For example, the applicant cites the following passage from
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> s follows:
The officer's finding of sufficiency of evidence cannot be divorced from the officer's credibility findings.
The first of these findings is the officer's adoption of the RPD's credibility conclusions. While that conclusion alone may not be sufficient to trigger the need for a hearing
, that conclusion combined with the officer's adverse inference about a letter in lieu of an affidavit and the comments about not finding any information about the clan or tribe, leads to the conclusion that the officer did not find the applicant and her witness to be believable.
[Emphasis added]
[28]
As an aside and with respect, I point out my difficulty with the underlined sentence of the above quote, which appears to imply that the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence to raise a serious issue of credibility cannot be separated as a distinct step from the adverse credibility finding that follows when the evidence is found to be insufficient. The necessity to distinguish between the two steps was elaborated above.
[29]
Coming back to the issue of the consequences of adopting the RPD's credibility conclusions, the reliance upon a previous adverse credibility finding arises in this matter from the officer's rejection of the applicant's explanation that he tried to live in Montenegro and Bosnia. On this point, he stated the following in his reasons:
I also note that the applicant left the country on two occasions in 2001 but did not seek protection in either as he stated "there were no long-term data prospects for protection". I note that both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro provide for the granting of asylum or refugee status.
Based on the RPD decision in 2004 where credibility was a determinative issue
, lack of accessing state protection or reconciliation and the fact that he went to two separate countries in 2011, after the Kola family began pursuing him, and did not seek protection in either, I give this statement of risk little weight.
[Emphasis added]
[30]
While the evidence on state protection was obviously insufficient, I find it problematic that reliance by the officer on the RPD's negative credibility assessment should be considered a criterion to conclude a serious credibility issue arises. Rather, to opposite effect, I conclude that a previous negative credibility finding should be a factor
supporting
a conclusion that the applicant's statements carried little weight and are insufficient therefore to establish a serious credibility issue.
[31]
To a certain extent reliance upon the previous adverse credibility findings in an RPD raises an issue as to whether the applicant should continue to enjoy the benefits from the presumption of truthfulness attaching to his statements as described in cases such as
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 5 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[32]
The PRRA review is essentially a continuation of the RPD decision on the issue of risk. The officer is required as a first step to carefully review the RPD decision to determine what findings were made on the basis of the evidence that was presented. This is for the purpose of determining whether the applicant has met the condition precedent of demonstrating that the evidence led was not already presented to the RPD, before it will even be considered in the PRRA review.
[33]
Given this PRRA context, I find it illogical to accept that the RPD's previous negative characterization of the applicant's credibility on the same issue of risk based on the same character of evidence (threat to life in a blood feud over a refusal of marriage) can be ignored such that the applicant is considered on the same credibility plane as any new refugee claimant standing up to testify in an RPD hearing who benefits from the presumption of truthfulness attaching to his or her statements.
[34]
If the RPD found the applicant not to be credible in the first instance, it is arguable that that finding should apply concerning similar evidence on the same issues.
[35]
That argument may be considered on another day. But certainly I cannot find any basis for a less determinative conclusion arising from a previous negative credibility finding by the RPD - one that does not shut the door on evidence raising fresh credibility issues, but logically concludes that the judge-made presumption of the truthfulness of an applicant's statement no longer applies in a subsequent PRRA review when the applicant's credibility has been previously found wanting in the refugee process.
[36]
Applying that conclusion to the issue of weighing the seriousness of the credibility evidence means that the bar facing this applicant should be set higher, not lower, in order to demonstrate a serious issue of credibility that meets the requirements for an interview. Given that the other evidence was sufficient to support the officer's conclusions, the weight applied to previous adverse credibility findings is not determinative in this matter. It does, however, add to the confidence of the Court that the PRRA officer's decision concluding that an interview was not required falls within a range of reasonable acceptable outcomes.
VI. Certified Questions
[37]
The applicant proposed certified questions with respect to the controversy over the standard of review in these cases and the probative value of an adverse credibility finding in a previous RPD decision. I agree however, with the respondent's submissions that these issues are not determinative of this case and therefore no certified question will be proposed.
VII. Conclusion
[38]
For the above reasons, the application is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[39]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application is dismissed.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Annis
[Traduction]: Le demandeur sollicite le contrôle judiciaire d'une décision d'un agent principal d'immigration, en date du 29 octobre 2012, rejetant sa deuxième demande d'examen des risques avant renvoi [ERAR]. Pour les motifs qui suivent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.
II. Les faits
[2]
Monsieur Bicuku est né en 1975 dans un village de montagne en Albanie. Sa famille comptait quatre enfants en tout. Le mariage de ses parents fut arrangé. À l'insu de ses parents, M. Bicuku a eu des relations sexuelles avec deux femmes de la région alors qu'il était âgé de 21 ans. Lorsqu'il avait 26 ans, son père lui a annoncé qu'il avait été fiancé à la fille de Mhill Kola lorsque lui et elle étaient enfants. Il est allé rencontrer Mme Kola, mais elle [traduction] « avait des problèmes de motricité et tremblait continuellement ». Elle ne l'a pas regardé dans les yeux et elle souriait nerveusement [
sic
], pas d'un air heureux, comme si elle n'était pas tout à fait présente ». M. Bicuku a refusé de l'épouser.
[3]
Le père du demandeur a insisté. Le demandeur a refusé à maintes reprises d'épouser Mme Kola et a sollicité l'aide des notables de la région. Les deux pères n'ont pas accepté cela et le père de M. Bicuku a plus tard avisé ce dernier qu'il amènerait Mme Kola chez eux et que, avec ou sans cérémonie, ils deviendraient mari et femme. M. Bicuku s'est d'abord enfui à Tirana, puis au Canada. Il affirme qu'il s'est adressé à la police albanaise, mais que celle-ci a refusé de l'aider parce qu'il s'agissait d'une querelle du sang et qu'elle ne voulait pas s'en mêler.
[4]
M. Bicuku est arrivé au Canada le 26 juillet 2002. Il a demandé l'asile au motif que son refus d'épouser la femme choisie pour devenir son épouse avait déclenché une vendetta contre sa famille. Le 23 mars 2004, la Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR] a rejeté sa demande (ainsi que celle de son frère qui l'accompagnait) en mentionnant que la crédibilité était le point déterminant. La demande de contrôle judiciaire a été rejetée le 24 juin 2004. Une demande d'ERAR a été rejetée le 23 juillet 2008 et le 22 novembre 2008 M. Bicuku a quitté le Canada et est retourné en Albanie.
[5]
M. Bicuku déclare que lorsqu'il est retourné en Albanie, il n'a dit à personne qu'il était revenu. Il a vécu et travaillé à Bathore, près de la capitale, pendant deux ans. En novembre 2010, des individus liés à M. Kola lui ont tendu une embuscade alors qu'il rentrait chez lui après le travail. Ils l'ont battu à nouveau un mois et demi plus tard, une autre fois deux mois plus tard, puis encore une fois quelques mois après cela, et ils lui ont demandé de respecter la promesse faite par son père qu'il épouserait Mme Kola. Il s'en est allé en juin 2011. Toutefois, les individus en question l'ont retrouvé et l'ont enlevé en novembre 2011. Ils l'ont amené dans une tente située près d'un cours d'eau où ils l'ont gardé en isolement pendant toute la nuit, puis ils lui ont dit d'épouser Mme Kola, sans quoi il mourrait. Ils l'ont ensuite balancé sur le bord de la route.
[6]
Le demandeur s'est enfui au Monténégro et en Bosnie à des dates non précisées, mais il ne pouvait pas travailler dans ces pays et n'estimait pas qu'il serait reconnu comme réfugié par un pays européen.
[7]
Le 9 décembre 2011, M. Bicuku est entré de nouveau au Canada muni d'un faux passeport. Il a été accusé et déclaré coupable d'être entré au pays illégalement en vertu de l'alinéa 124(1)
a
) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [LIPR] et a été condamné à 155 jours d'emprisonnement.
[8]
M. Bicuku n'avait pas droit à une autre audience devant la SPR (paragraphe 101(1): La demande est irrecevable dans les cas suivants [...] b) rejet antérieur de la demande d'asile par la Commission) Il a demandé un autre ERAR et cette deuxième demande d'ERAR a été entendue en tenant compte des nouveaux éléments de preuve qui sont apparus depuis juillet 2008.
La décision attaquée
[9]
L'agent(e) d'ERAR a examiné la situation de M. Bicuku. Il (elle) elle a souligné que M. Bicuku avait présenté à titre de nouvel élément de preuve un document de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [CISR] daté de mai 2008, des articles datés du 1er juillet 2010, du 5 juillet 2011, du 18 mai 2011, du 10 février 2012, du 24 mars 2012, et du 25 juillet 2012, un rapport de Freedom House sur les droits de la personne daté de 2011, des lettres de sa mère, de son frère, de son cousin, et d'un ami dont les dates vont du 1er mai 2012 au 10 juillet 2012, un affidavit qu'il a souscrit le 14 mai 2012.
[10]
Les affidavits du frère, du cousin, et d'un ami relataient ce que le demandeur leur avait dit, et on leur a donc accordé peu de poids. L'affidavit de la mère faisait mention de la querelle avec la famille Kola, mais les renseignements concernant les agressions commises sur M. Bicuku étaient fondés sur ce qu'il lui avait dit et il ne contenait aucun renseignement quant à un quelconque préjudice qu'aurait subi l'un ou l'autre membre de la famille depuis une dizaine d'années. L'agent(e) d'ERAR a également accordé peu de poids à cette lettre.
[11]
L'agent(e) d'ERAR a souligné que le demandeur, selon son affidavit, n'a jamais signalé l'une ou l'autre des attaques aux autorités et n'a pas tenté de mettre fin à la querelle en s'adressant à l'un des comités de réconciliations existants. Il a également quitté l'Albanie à deux reprises en 2011, mais il n'a pas demandé l'asile. L'agent(e) d'ERAR a souligné que le Monténégro et la Bosnie accordent l'asile aux réfugiés. Il a donc été accordé peu de poids à l'affidavit du demandeur.
[12]
Après avoir fait un examen minutieux de la documentation sur la situation dans le pays, l'agent(e) d'ERAR a souligné que bien qu'il(elle) ait accordé un certain poids à cet élément de preuve en établissant l'existence de querelles du sang en Albanie, le demandeur n'avait pas démontré qu'il était impliqué dans une vendetta avec la famille Kola. L'agent a donc accordé peu de poids à cet élément de preuve pour ce qui est d'établir le risque auquel le demandeur serait personnellement exposé.
[13]
L'agent(e) d'ERAR a reconnu que certaines questions en matière de droits de la personne constituaient toujours un problème en Albanie, mais a conclu que la documentation objective n'établissait pas que le demandeur serait exposé à un risque personnel. L'État albanais, bien qu'il soit aux prises avec des problèmes de corruption et d'impunité des policiers, fonctionne et le demandeur n'avait pas fourni de preuves claires et convaincantes de son refus ou de son incapacité à le protéger.
[14]
Enfin, l'agent(e) d'ERAR a souligné que l'avocat du demandeur avait demandé qu'une audience soit tenue. Toutefois, l'agent(e) n'avait pas conclu que les conditions énumérées à l'article 167 du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 [RIPR] étaient présentes et donc n'avait pas conclu que la tenue d'une audience était requise.
III. Les questions en litige
[15]
Les parties ont convenu à l'audience que la seule question en litige était de savoir si l'agent(e) d'ERAR devait accorder au demandeur une entrevue parce que la preuve soulevait une question importante de crédibilité.
IV. La norme de contrôle
[16]
La jurisprudence concernant la norme de contrôle qui s'applique aux décisions concernant la tenue d'une aux termes de l'article 167 du RIPR et de l'article 113 de la LIPR est partagée. À cet égard, je cite les propos suivants formulés par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 24:
[24] La jurisprudence de la Cour est divisée sur la norme de contrôle qui s'applique aux décisions concernant la tenue d'une audience aux termes de l'alinéa 113
b
)
.
Je me suis récemment penché sur cette question dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et je ne peux faire guère mieux que de répéter ce que j'ai écrit dans cette décision (au paragraphe 24):
Cela étant dit, une controverse existe dans la jurisprudence de la Cour fédérale au sujet de la norme de contrôle à appliquer lors de la révision de la décision d'un agent de ne pas convoquer d'audience, notamment dans le contexte d'une décision ERAR. Dans certains cas, la Cour a appliqué la norme de la décision correcte, parce que l'affaire a été considérée essentiellement comme une question d'équité procédurale (voir, par exemple,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (disponible sur CanLII)). En revanche, la norme de la décision raisonnable a été appliquée dans d'autres cas, au motif que l'examen de la pertinence de tenir une audience à la lumière du contexte particulier d'un dossier donne lieu à l'exercice d'un pouvoir discrétionnaire qui commande la déférence (voir, par exemple,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 160 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (disponible sur CanLII) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ). Je souscris à cette dernière position, du moins lorsque la Cour révise une décision ERAR.
Voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
[17]
J'adopte le raisonnement du juge de Montigny selon lequel « la pertinence de tenir une audience à la lumière du contexte particulier d'un dossier donne lieu à l'exercice d'un pouvoir discrétionnaire qui commande la déférence ». La norme de contrôle applicable en l'espèce est donc celle de la décision raisonnable.
[18]
À titre de commentaires additionnels, il est bien établi en droit que la norme de contrôle reflète dans une large mesure le régime législatif régissant les fonctions de décideur.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> où la Cour a déclaré ce qui suit:
La réponse réside dans le fait que
Dunsmuir
reconnaît que le caractère raisonnable de la décision s'apprécie dans le contexte du type particulier de processus décisionnel en cause et de l'ensemble des facteurs pertinents. Il s'agit essentiellement d'une analyse contextuelle (
Dunsmuir
, par. 64). Comme l'a dit le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , par. 59, « [l] a raisonnabilité constitue une norme unique qui s'adapte au contexte. » La question fondamentale est de savoir quelle est la
portée
du pouvoir décisionnel
que la loi a conféré au décideur
. La portée du pouvoir décisionnel d'un organisme est déterminée par le type de situation en question.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[19]
Le régime législatif a stipulé ce qui devrait constituer une audience équitable relativement au droit d'un demandeur d'être entendu dans le cadre d'une demande d'ERAR. Le législateur a délégué la responsabilité de cette tâche à l'agent d'ERAR qui agit en quelque sorte comme gardien de l'occasion d'avoir une entrevue comme aspect des exigences en matière d'équité du processus d'ERAR. L'agent est tenu d'examiner et d'apprécier la preuve quant à la crédibilité pour déterminer s'il suffit de soulever une question importante quant à la crédibilité. La loi décrit la fonction d'un décideur administratif comme en étant une qui commande l'application de la norme de la raisonnabilité même si elle a trait à un précepte d'équité concernant la possibilité de se faire entendre.
[20]
Dans la même veine, j'estime que le mot « important » est un autre élément qui détermine que la fonction de l'agent d'ERAR commande l'application de la norme de la raisonnabilité. L'agent est tenu non seulement de déterminer s'il existe des éléments de preuve soulevant un problème quant à la crédibilité du demandeur, mais détermine également si la preuve a une valeur probante
suffisante
pour constituer une question
importante
de crédibilité. Cela signifie que l'agent est d'abord tenu d'examiner la preuve quant à la crédibilité, non dans le but de déterminer, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, si le demandeur est crédible, mais pour déterminer s'il suffit de soulever une question importante concernant la crédibilité pour que la tenue d'une entrevue soit nécessaire. La distinction revêt une certaine importance. La question de savoir si la preuve contient une question importante concernant la crédibilité met en cause l'expertise du tribunal relativement aux exigences mentionnées aux articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR. Cet exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire est difficile et il faut faire preuve de déférence à son égard.
A. Le caractère suffisant de la crédibilité de la preuve ou une conclusion relative à la crédibilité?
[21]
Les observations du demandeur démontrent la nécessité d'éviter une mauvaise interprétation des motifs de l'agent(e) d'ERAR comme preuve d'une conclusion relative à la crédibilité, alors qu'il s'agissait d'une évaluation de la preuve relative à la crédibilité pour déterminer si elle était suffisante pour soulever une question importante.
[22]
La détermination de savoir si la tenue d'une entrevue est exigée est la deuxième des trois étapes du processus d'ERAR. La première consiste à déterminer s'il existe une preuve autre que celle qui a été soumise à la SPR; la deuxième consiste à savoir si une entrevue est nécessaire; la troisième étape consiste à trancher l'affaire. La deuxième étape consiste à apprécier la preuve relative à la crédibilité. Ce processus donne nécessairement naissance à des contre-arguments, comme en l'espèce pourquoi la preuve ne faisait pas mention du signalement des incidents aux autorités, ou de tentatives faite par le demandeur en vue de mettre fin à la querelle grâce aux mécanismes créés à cette fin par l'État. L'agent(e) a conclu que pour que la preuve ait une valeur probante suffisante pour que la tenue d'une entrevue soit nécessaire, il incombe au demandeur de mentionner s'il a pris les mesures auxquelles on pourrait raisonnablement s'attendre, ou expliquer pourquoi il ne l'a pas fait. Comme ces aspects évidents et importants de la preuve du demandeur étaient absents, sa preuve ne soulevait aucune question importante concernant la crédibilité.
[23]
La preuve soumise par les membres de la famille n'était également pas assez importante pour confirmer une question importante concernant la crédibilité du demandeur. Elle était surtout composée de renseignements communiqués par le demandeur, alors que la preuve émanant directement des membres de la famille avait très peu de poids, comme la description du demandeur comme manifestant de la crainte lorsqu'il relate ses récits. Aucun élément de preuve n'était une observation directe ou des descriptions de
res gestae
immédiatement après les événements à l'appui du demandeur. La preuve avait une valeur probante minimale et ne soulevait aucune question importante qui contredisait la conclusion selon laquelle le demandeur ne pouvait pas vraiment prouver la véracité de son récit.
[24]
Ces conclusions peuvent être décrites comme étant des conclusions relatives à la crédibilité, une conclusion d'absence de crédibilité n'est tirée qu'
après
avoir conclu que la tenue d'une entrevue n'est pas nécessaire. En concluant que la preuve relative à la crédibilité n'avait pas suffisamment de poids pour constituer une question « importante », le résultat est que l'agent(e) rejette également la preuve, c'est-à-dire tirer une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité en raison de son absence de valeur probante. Toutefois, la question en litige dans la présente demande consiste à savoir si la tenue d'une entrevue est nécessaire. Il s'agit d'une question d'insuffisance de la preuve sur le plan de son poids, et non pas d'une affaire qui a en fin de compte été rejetée pour des motifs de crédibilité. Néanmoins, les décisions relatives aux deux questions ne peuvent pas être séparées.
[25]
Ce n'est que lorsque l'agent(e) conclut qu'il existe une preuve suffisante qu'il existe une question importante relativement à la crédibilité que la troisième étape distincte sera entreprise, après une entrevue, afin de déterminer si la preuve est suffisamment fiable selon la prépondérance des probabilités pour tirer une conclusion. La procédure analogue à celle suivie par un juge lorsqu'il décide s'il y a suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour soumettre l'affaire au jury afin qu'il la tranche selon la prépondérance des probabilités. Le demandeur a en effet été débouté quant à la question de la crédibilité parce que la preuve n'avait pas suffisamment de poids pour atteindre la troisième étape du processus d'ERAR.
B. La conclusion défavorable antérieure quant à la crédibilité du défendeur
[26]
La jurisprudence relative à l'exigence de procéder à une entrevue semble étayer une conclusion selon laquelle invoquer, ou même mentionner, une conclusion défavorable antérieure quant à la crédibilité du demandeur est un facteur que le demandeur peut invoquer pour démontrer qu'une question importante quant à la crédibilité, exigeant la tenue d'une entrevue, est soulevée.
[27]
Par exemple, le demandeur cite l'extrait suivant tiré de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
La conclusion de l'agente sur le caractère suffisant des preuves prises en compte ne peut être séparée de ses conclusions sur la crédibilité.
La première de ces conclusions est celle par laquelle elle a fait sienne la conclusion de la SPR sur la crédibilité. Bien que cette conclusion ne suffise pas à elle seule à rendre nécessaire la tenue d'une audience
, sa conjugaison avec la conclusion défavorable de l'agente sur la valeur probante de la lettre par opposition à un affidavit et son observation qu'elle n'avait pu trouver aucune information sur l'existence du clan ou de la tribu en question, engage à conclure qu'elle n'a pas trouvé dignes de foi la demanderesse et les témoins cités par cette dernière.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[28]
Je souligne en passant, en toute déférence, que le passage souligné de l'extrait qui précède me pose problème, car il semble donner à entendre que la question de savoir si la preuve est suffisante pour soulever une question importante quant à la crédibilité ne peut pas être séparée, à titre d'étape distincte, de la conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité qui est tirée lorsque la preuve est jugée insuffisante. La nécessité de faire une distinction entre les deux étapes a été expliquée ci-dessus.
[29]
Pour ce qui est de la question des conséquences de retenir les conclusions de la SPR quant à la crédibilité, il ressort en l'espèce que le rejet par l'agent(e) de l'explication du demandeur selon laquelle il a tenté de vivre au Monténégro et en Bosnie était fondé sur une conclusion défavorable déjà tirée quant à la crédibilité. À cet égard, il(elle) a déclaré ce qui suit dans ses motifs:
[traduction]
Je souligne également que le demandeur a quitté le pays à deux reprises en 2001, mais qu'il n'a pas demandé l'asile à l'une ou l'autre de ces occasions, car il a déclaré « qu'il n'existait aucune donnée à long terme quant à la possibilité d'obtenir l'asile ». Je souligne que la Bosnie-Herzégovine et le Monténégro accordent tous les deux l'asile ou le statut de réfugié.
Compte tenu de la décision rendue par la SPR en 2004 dans laquelle la crédibilité était une question déterminante
, de l'absence de la possibilité d'obtenir la protection de l'État ou de la possibilité qu'il y ait réconciliation et du fait qu'il soit allé dans deux pays distincts en 2011, après que la famille Kola eut commencé à le pourchasser, et qu'il n'a demandé l'asile dans aucun de ces pays, j'accorde peu de poids à cette déclaration sur le risque.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[30]
La preuve relative à la protection de l'État était manifestement insuffisante, mais l'argument voulant que le fait que l'agent(e) se soit fié(e) à l'évaluation défavorable faite par la SPR quant à la crédibilité devrait être considéré comme un critère permettant de conclure qu'une question importante quant à la crédibilité est soulevée me pose problème. Je conclus, au contraire, qu'une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité déjà tirée devrait être un facteur
étayant
la conclusion selon laquelle les déclarations du demandeur avaient peu de poids et sont donc insuffisantes pour établir l'existence d'une question importante quant à la crédibilité.
[31]
Dans une certaine mesure, le fait de se fier à une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité déjà tirée par la SPR soulève la question de savoir si le demandeur devrait continuer de jouir de la présomption de véracité de ses déclarations notamment décrite dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), au paragraphe 5 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[32]
L'ERAR est essentiellement la suite de la décision de la SPR sur la question du risque. L'agent doit d'abord examiner soigneusement la décision de la SPR afin de déterminer quelles conclusions ont été tirées sur la foi de la preuve qui a été présentée. Cet exercice vise à déterminer, avant que la preuve ne soit examinée dans le cadre d'un ERAR, si le demandeur a satisfait à la condition préalable qui consiste à démontrer que la preuve soumise n'a pas déjà présentée à la SPR.
[33]
Compte tenu du présent contexte d'ERAR, j'estime qu'il est illogique d'accepter que la conclusion défavorable tirée sur la crédibilité du demandeur par la SPR, sur la foi d'une preuve de même nature (menace à la vie dans le cadre d'une querelle découlant d'un refus relatif à un mariage), quant à la même question du risque, peut ne pas être prise en compte, de sorte que le demandeur soit considéré comme étant, sur le plan de la crédibilité, sur le même pied que le nouveau demandeur d'asile qui témoigne dans une audience devant la SPR et qui jouit, à l'égard de ses déclarations, de la présomption de véracité.
[34]
Si la SPR a d'abord conclu que le demandeur n'était pas crédible, on peut prétendre que cette conclusion devrait s'appliquer quant à une preuve similaire portant sur les mêmes questions.
[35]
Cet argument peut être examiné à un autre moment. Mais, manifestement, je ne vois aucune raison de tirer, à la suite d'une conclusion défavorable déjà tirée par la SPR quant à la crédibilité, une conclusion moins déterminante, c'est-à-dire une conclusion qui n'écarte pas une preuve soulevant de nouvelles questions relativement à la crédibilité, mais selon laquelle, logiquement, la présomption faite par le juge de la véracité de la déclaration d'un demandeur ne s'applique pas dans le cadre d'un ERAR ultérieur alors que la crédibilité du demandeur a déjà été jugée insatisfaisante dans le cadre du processus de demande d'asile.
[36]
L'application de cette conclusion à la question de l'appréciation du caractère sérieux de la preuve relative à la crédibilité a pour effet que le critère auquel est soumis le demandeur devrait être plus exigeant, et non pas moins exigeant, afin de démontrer l'existence d'une question importante concernant la crédibilité qui satisfait aux conditions exigées pour la tenue d'une entrevue. Étant donné que l'autre preuve était suffisante pour étayer les conclusions de l'agent, le poids accordé aux conclusions défavorables déjà tirées quant à la crédibilité n'est pas déterminant en l'espèce. Toutefois, il a pour effet que la Cour estime davantage que la décision par laquelle l'agent(e) d'ERAR a conclu qu'il n'était pas nécessaire de tenir une entrevue appartient aux issues raisonnables et acceptables.
V. Les questions certifiées
[37]
Le demandeur a proposé des questions à la certification relativement à la controverse relative à la norme de contrôle applicable aux cas comme celui en l'espèce et à la valeur probante d'une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité tirée dans une décision antérieure de la SPR. Toutefois, je souscris aux prétentions du défendeur selon lesquelles ces questions ne sont pas déterminantes en l'espèce et, par conséquent, aucune question ne sera proposée à la certification.
VI. Dispositif
[38]
Pour les motifs qui précèdent, la présente demande sera rejetée.

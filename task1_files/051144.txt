 Blanchard, J. 
 : The Minister seeks judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27 [ 
 IRPA 
 ] of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated June 22, 2012, granting the Respondent refugee status.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The Applicant seeks an order pursuant to paragraph 18.3(1)( 
 b 
 ) of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c F-7, quashing or setting aside the decision and referring the matter back to the RPD for determination in accordance with such directions as the Court considers appropriate.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The Respondent is a Sri Lankan citizen of Tamil ethnicity. He arrived in Canada aboard the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
  with 75 other men on October 17, 2009, and immediately sought asylum pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the  
 IRPA 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  The Respondent and his family were displaced because of the war and fled to India where they lived in a refugee camp from 1990 to 2004. The Respondent continued his education while in India and worked as a painter and mason until he returned to Sri Lanka in February 2004.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  The Respondent describes his circumstances in Sri Lanka after his return from India as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) In 2006, the Respondent learned that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) took his cousin who had been living with the family. She became a combatant for the LTTE cause. In April 2007, two armed men in plainclothes knocked at the door of their home and asked if the Respondent was associated with the LTTE, claiming they knew he had been in suspicious areas of the country, and his cousin had been taken by the LTTE. Worried that he might encounter them again, the Respondent went to stay with an uncle. He then moved every month, staying in hiding until he left Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) The Respondent's cousin was killed in combat in 2008, and the army intelligence department arrested the Respondent's uncle because they suspected him of helping the LTTE. The uncle was released in December 2009.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) On June 4, 2008, the Special Task Force arrested the Respondent with his older brother on suspicion of LTTE involvement. They were taken to an army camp in ■■■■■■, handcuffed to each other, checked for ID, and then beaten. He was then threatened with a gun, and an interrogator put a pen in his ear to hit when the Respondent did not answer a question put to him. He was asked whether he was a member of or assisted the LTTE, and he denied these allegations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) The next day, the Respondent was taken to court with his brother, charged with suspicion of being involved with the LTTE, and detained for seven days. He was taken back to court with his brother, and they were both released by the judge and allowed to return to work. Shortly thereafter, fearing for his safety, the Respondent left his job.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (e) Later in 2008, the Respondent was picked up in army round-ups and detained twice, once on October 5, 2008 when he was tortured, and once on March 7, 2009 when he was beaten. Both times, he was held for one day, and the authorities questioned him about his involvement with the LTTE.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (f) In May 2009, the Respondent went to Colombo and, with a passport issued in 2005, applied for a visa to Thailand. On June 15, 2009, he left for Thailand by air and then made his way to Canada in October 2009 aboard the  
 MV Ocean Lady.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Decision under review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The RPD determined that the Respondent "is a Convention refugee based on membership in a particular social group and political opinion." The RPD considered the Respondent's credibility and  
 sur place 
  elements to be the determinative issues.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  The RPD believed the Respondent's narrative about being detained ■■■■■■■■■ with his brother in 2008 on "suspicion." Based on his testimony and corroborating medical evidence the RPD was satisfied that he was physically and mentally assaulted by the police.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  However, the RPD had credibility concerns relating to other aspects of the Respondent's narrative. His inability to relate details and inconsistencies in his testimony caused the RPD to reject his claim that he was detained twice more in October 2008 and March 2009. The RPD determined that "the claimant was not a person of interest to the Sri Lankan authorities and he was not suspected of having LTTE connections form June 2008 to May 2009 when he left Sri Lanka. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [9] 
  Further, based on a lack of interest by the authorities in other family members, the RPD found that "the authorities do not suspect the claimant as having links with the LTTE, nor have they determined him to be a person of interest since his arrival in Canada. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [10] 
  With respect to the Respondent's  
 sur place 
  claim, the RPD found that the Respondent's Tamil ethnicity and association with the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
  are indisputable. The RPD assessed the Respondent's claim under section 96 of the  
 IRPA 
 , "membership in a particular social group," because his voyage on the  
 Ocean Lady 
  "is an unalterable historical fact. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [11] 
  The RPD also assessed the Respondent's claim under another Convention ground, namely, real or imputed political opinion "in regards to the state of Sri Lanka's potential perception of him as a Tamil travelling on the MV Ocean Lady and thus being perceived as potentially having an association with the LTTE. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [12] 
  The RPD summarized its findings relating to refugee protection and state protection as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Based on the evidence before me, in particular his association with MV Ocean Lady that has been internationally labelled as an LTTE vessel and its crew and complement publicly profiled as persons with a typical LTTE profile, I find these factors would make him a person of interest to the Sri Lankan authorities if returned to Sri Lanka. On a balance of probabilities, I find that he would be questioned and detained. In the face of both the independent objective country evidence and the claimant's prior treatment by the STF in 2008, which I found to be credible, I find that he faces more than a serious possibility of persecution by the state security apparatus. As the state is the perpetrator of such treatment, I also find that he has no state protection or a viable internal flight alternative.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The following issues are raised in this application:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) Did the RPD err in concluding that the Respondent's claim had a nexus to a ground in the Convention refugee definition, pursuant to section 96 of the  
 IRPA 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) Was the RPD's decision sufficiently intelligible to be reasonable?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  The issue of nexus to a Convention ground raises a question of mixed law and fact. Here, the question raised concerns the existence of a connection between the "particular social group" and "political opinion" Convention grounds and the Respondent's particular factual circumstances. It follows that the applicable standard of review is reasonableness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Issues relating to the sufficiency and intelligibility of reasons are also reviewable on the reasonableness standard. See:  
 Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  
 Dunsmuir 
  at paragraph 47.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  The Applicant contends that the RPD erred in concluding that the Respondent is a Convention refugee based solely on his connection to the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
 . The Applicant argues that "the RPD reached its conclusion without any meaningful analysis or even without making a determinative finding that the Respondent has a nexus to one of the five grounds listed in the 'Convention refugee' definition," thereby failing to satisfy the requirements of section 96 of the  
 IRPA 
 . Further, the Applicant argues that the RPD's reasons are unintelligible, thereby rendering the decision unreasonable since a reviewing court would not understand why the RPD made its decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Early in its reasons, the RPD found that the Respondent would not be perceived as being connected with the LTTE. The Applicant therefore argues that it is inconsistent for the RPD to conclude later that the Respondent is perceived to have a link to the LTTE because he was a passenger on the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
 . I reject this argument. I find no inconsistency in the RPD's findings. At paragraph 37 of its reasons, the RPD clearly indicates that its prior finding relates to the Respondent's profile of interest to Sri Lankan authorities prior to his departure from Sri Lanka, or after his arrival in Canada. It is only after events relating to the publicity surrounding the voyage of the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
  relating to its ownership by the LTTE, its history and its suspected LTTE passenger, that the RPD found the Respondent's link to the LTTE was established. This is consistent with a  
 sur place 
  claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  The Applicant's core submission is that the RPD's sole basis for granting the refugee claim is because the Respondent was a migrant from the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
 . In my view, the RPD's reasons say much more. As summarized above, the RPD accepts that the Respondent is a Tamil male from northern Sri Lanka traveling on the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
 , a ship owned by the LTTE along with 76 other Tamil males including at least one confirmed suspected LTTE passenger. These findings by the RPD establish the context and circumstances that led to its positive decision on the claim. Therefore, being a migrant on the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
  is not an accurate way to describe the basis for the RPD's decision. Rather, the basis for the RPD's decision, as reflected in its reasons, is that the Respondent has a nexus to a Convention ground, imputed political opinion, because he is a Tamil male from northern Sri Lanka traveling alongside passengers with suspected links to the LTTE on the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
 , a Tamil Tiger ship used in the past to smuggle arms. Further, the RPD noted in its reasons that expert evidence established that all persons who traveled on the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
  "fit into the typical profile of LTTE terrorist" and notes the absence of women and children on this vessel.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  The RPD concludes that "because of the time he spent on the ship, and supposedly in the company of an individual for which there is an INTERPOL Red Notice, he would be wanted for more specific questioning regarding his potential knowledge, real or imputed, of LTTE operatives. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [20] 
  The Applicant argues that the above finding, at most, establishes that the Sri Lankan authorities believe the Respondent may have information about the LTTE and/or and INTERPOL wanted suspect, because he was a passenger on the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
 . The Applicant maintains there is ample jurisprudence to support the proposition that a claimant who fears persecution merely because he or she is believed to have information about - as opposed to sharing the political views of - a terrorist or criminal organization does not have a nexus to the Convention ground of "political opinion".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  I accept that the RPD's conclusion, reproduced above, could have been better articulated and should have focused on the finding of perceived links to the LTTE rather than the finding of imputed knowledge about the LTTE. Nonetheless, the RPD at paragraph 32 of its reasons found that "[t]he claimant's ethnicity as a Tamil and his link to the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
  are indisputable facts." It also found that the Respondent would be perceived by the state of Sri Lanka as potentially having an association with the LTTE. These findings coupled with other elements of evidence that tie the voyage of the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
  to the LTTE provide a sufficient basis to conclude that there is a nexus to political opinion. Further, although the RPD did not expressly find a nexus to race, such a link can be inferred from its reasons. The RPD repeatedly referenced materials that related to the circumstances and risks of Tamils returnees particularly returnees from northern Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  The Supreme Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  at paragraph 48 endorsed the view that, when reviewing a decision on the reasonableness standard, a court must pay "respectful attention to the reasons offered  
 or which could have been offered 
  in support of a decision." Mr. Justice Evans in a dissenting decision in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (subsequently adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada, in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) confirmed the above view. He wrote at paragraph 164 of his reasons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The underlined words avoid an unduly formalistic approach to judicial review. Thus, to the extent that the Tribunal does not fully explain aspects of its decision, the Court may consult evidence referred to by the Tribunal in order to flesh out its reasons. However, I do not regard the Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  as inviting a reviewing court to usurp the tribunal's responsibility for justifying its decisions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  In my view, the RPD's reasons relating to its finding of a nexus to "political opinion" sufficiently demonstrate "justification, transparency and intelligibility with the decision making process. See:  
 Dunsmuir 
  at paragraph 47. In my view, the evidence of the Respondent's circumstances relating to his voyage of the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
  is sufficient to support the RPD's finding notwithstanding the above discussed deficiencies in its reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  Reading the reasons as a whole, I am satisfied that it was reasonably open to the RPD on the record before it to find that the Respondent will be perceived to have a political opinion contrary to that of the government of Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  On the basis of the RPD's factual findings relating to the  
 sur place 
  claim articulated in its reasons, coupled with the documentary evidence relating to the treatment of returnees in such circumstances, it was reasonably open to the RPD to find that the Respondent would face more than a serious possibility of persecution by state actors upon his return to Sri Lanka by reason of his imputed political opinion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  While the above finding is dispositive of the application, I nevertheless find it useful to address the RPD's finding relating to the "particular social group" to which I now turn.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  The Applicant contends that the RPD's conclusion that the Respondent's circumstance as an ethnic Tamil on board the  
 MV Ocean Lady 
  is an unalterable historical fact and causes him to be part of a "particular social group" is contrary to established jurisprudence on the scope of "particular social group." The Applicant argues that choosing to set sail for Canada on an illegal human smuggling ship does not engage the defence of human rights or anti-discrimination and as a result does not fall into a category described in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  There is no question that being a mere passenger on a ship destined for Canada from Sri Lanka, on its own, does not establish a membership in a "particular social group" for the purposes of section 96 of the  
 IRPA 
 . In  
 Ward 
 , Justice La Forest, at page 739, dealt with the meaning to be assigned to a "particular social group": "The meaning assigned to 'particular social group' in the Act should take into account the general underlying themes of the defence of human rights and anti-discrimination that form the basis for the international refugee protection initiative. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [29] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , commenting on the reasons he had rendered in  
 Ward 
 , Justice La Forest stated that "[t] he general underlying themes of the defence of human rights and anti-discrimination were to remain the paramount consideration in determining the claimant's membership in any particular social group." Here, the RPD in its reasons fails to conduct this first step in the required analysis to determine whether the Respondent could be classified within a particular social group. I am not prepared to read in such an analysis. The deficiency, however, is not fatal to the decision since, as found above, the RPD's findings relating to the Respondent's fear of persecution based on his imputed political opinion is reasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  I now turn to the final issue raised by the Applicant that the RPD's reasons are unreasonable because they are unintelligible. With respect to the determinative issue, the nexus to political opinion, I am satisfied that the reasons allow the Court to understand why the RPD made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes. See:  
 Newfoundland Nurses' Union 
  at paragraph 16. While the reasons could have included greater detail and clarity relating to certain constituent elements, I am satisfied that the reasons are sufficiently clear to permit the Court to conduct a review of the decision. In the result, the Applicant's argument is rejected. The decision is reasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  For the above reasons, the application for judicial review will be dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  The parties have had the opportunity to raise a serious question of general importance as contemplated by paragraph 74( 
 d 
 ) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27, and have not done so. I am satisfied that no serious question of general importance arises on this record. I do not propose to certify a question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 , L.C. 2001, ch. 27 (LIPR) d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada datée du 22 juin 2012, par laquelle le défendeur s'est vu accorder le statut de réfugié.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Le demandeur sollicite, conformément à l'alinéa 18.1(3)b) de la  
 Loi sur les Cours fédérales 
 , L.R.C. (1985), ch. F-7, une ordonnance cassant ou annulant la décision et renvoyant l'affaire à la SPR pour qu'elle fasse l'objet d'une nouvelle décision selon les directives que la Cour estime appropriées.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Les faits  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Le défendeur est un citoyen du Sri Lanka d'origine tamoule. Il est arrivé au Canada à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
  en compagnie de 75 autres hommes le 17 octobre 2009 et il a immédiatement présenté une demande d'asile en vertu de l'article 96 et du paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  Le défendeur et sa famille ont été déplacés en raison de la guerre et se sont enfuis en Inde, où ils ont vécu dans un camp de réfugiés de 1990 à 2004. Le défendeur a poursuivi ses études en Inde et il a travaillé comme peintre et maçon jusqu'à son retour au Sri Lanka en février 2004.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Le défendeur décrit ainsi sa situation au Sri Lanka après son retour de l'Inde:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) En 2006, le défendeur a appris que sa cousine, qui vivait avec sa famille, avait été enlevée par les Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (TLET). Elle a dû participer aux combats pour la cause des TLET. En avril 2007, deux hommes armés en tenue civile ont cogné à la porte de leur domicile et demandé au défendeur s'il était lié aux TLET, affirmant qu'ils savaient qu'il s'était trouvé dans des régions suspectes du pays et que sa cousine avait été enlevée par les TLET. Inquiet à l'idée de les rencontrer de nouveau, le défendeur est allé vivre chez un oncle. Il s'est ensuite mis à déménager tous les mois, demeurant caché jusqu'à son départ du Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) La cousine du défendeur est morte lors d'un combat en 2008, et les services de renseignement de l'armée ont arrêté l'oncle du défendeur parce qu'ils le soupçonnaient d'aider les TLET. L'oncle a été libéré en décembre 2009.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) Le 4 juin 2008, une force opérationnelle spéciale a arrêté le défendeur et son frère aîné parce qu'ils étaient soupçonnés d'entretenir des liens avec les TLET. Ils ont été amenés à un camp de l'armée à ■■■■■■, menottés l'un à l'autre, leurs pièces d'identité ont été vérifiées, et ils ont été battus. Il a ensuite été menacé avec un fusil, et un interrogateur lui a introduit un crayon dans l'oreille et il donnait un coup sur celui-ci chaque fois que le défendeur ne répondait pas à ses questions. Il s'est vu demander s'il appartenait aux TLET ou s'il les aidait, et il a nié ces insinuations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) Le lendemain, le défendeur a été amené au tribunal avec son frère et il a été accusé d'entretenir des liens avec les TLET, puis gardé en détention pendant sept jours. Il a comparu de nouveau avec son frère, et tous deux ont été relâchés par le juge et autorisés à retourner travailler. Peu après, craignant pour sa sécurité, le défendeur a quitté son emploi.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (e) Plus tard en 2008, le défendeur a été arrêté lors de rafles de l'armée et placé deux fois en détention; la première fois, le 5 octobre 2008, il a été torturé, et la seconde fois, le 7 mars 2009, il a été battu. Ces deux périodes de détention n'ont duré qu'une journée, et les autorités l'ont interrogé au sujet de sa participation à l'organisation des TLET.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (f) En mai 2009, le défendeur s'est rendu à Colombo et, au moyen de son passeport délivré en 2005, il a présenté une demande de visa pour la Thaïlande. Le 15 juin 2009, il a pris un vol à destination de la Thaïlande et il est arrivé au Canada à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
  en octobre 2009.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Décision contrôlée  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  La SPR a conclu que le défendeur « a qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention du fait de son appartenance à un groupe social et de ses opinions politiques ». La SPR a estimé que la crédibilité du défendeur et les éléments sur place étaient les questions déterminantes.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  La SPR a prêté foi au récit du défendeur sur sa détention à ■■■■■■■■■ avec son frère en 2008 au motif qu'ils faisaient l'objet de « soupçons ». À la lumière du témoignage du demandeur et des éléments de preuve d'ordre médical corroborants, la SPR était convaincue qu'il avait été agressé physiquement et psychologiquement par la police.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  Toutefois, la SPR a estimé que le récit du défendeur comportait certains problèmes de crédibilité. Son incapacité de rendre compte de certains détails et les incohérences dans son témoignage ont amené la SPR à rejeter l'allégation du défendeur selon laquelle il avait été détenu deux autres fois en octobre 2008 et en mars 2009. La SPR a conclu que « le demandeur d'asile ne présentait aucun intérêt pour les autorités sri-lankaises et n'était pas soupçonné d'entretenir des liens avec les TLET de juin 2008 à mai 2009, lorsqu'il a quitté le Sri Lanka ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  De plus, compte tenu du peu d'intérêt manifesté par les autorités à l'endroit des autres membres de la famille du défendeur, la SPR a conclu que « les autorités ne soupçonnent pas le demandeur d'asile d'avoir des liens avec les TLET, et qu'elles n'ont pas jugé qu'il était une personne d'intérêt depuis son arrivée au Canada ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  En ce qui a trait à la demande d'asile sur place, la SPR a conclu que les origines tamoules du défendeur et son lien avec le navire  
 Ocean Lady 
  sont incontestables. La SPR a évalué sa demande d'asile au titre de l'article 96 de la LIPR, « appartenance à un groupe social », étant donné que son voyage à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
  « est un fait historique indiscutable ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  La SPR a également évalué la demande du défendeur en fonction d'un autre motif prévu à la Convention, soit les opinions politiques, présumées ou réelles, « en ce qui concerne la perception que pouvaient avoir de lui les autorités sri-lankaises, étant donné qu'il était un Tamoul voyageant à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
  et qu'il pouvait pour cette raison être soupçonné d'avoir des liens avec les TLET ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  La SPR a résumé ainsi ses conclusions relatives à l'asile et à la protection de l'État:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Compte tenu des éléments de preuve dont je dispose, tout spécialement en ce qui concerne les liens du demandeur d'asile avec le navire  
 Ocean Lady 
 , qui a été étiqueté partout dans le monde comme un navire des TLET, et le fait que toutes les personnes qui étaient à bord ont été présentées au public comme des membres des TLET, j'estime que le demandeur d'asile serait une personne d'intérêt pour les autorités sri-lankaises s'il était renvoyé au Sri Lanka. Selon la prépondérance des probabilités, j'estime qu'il serait questionné et détenu. À la lumière des éléments de preuve objectifs sur le pays qui proviennent de sources indépendantes et des allégations du demandeur d'asile sur la façon dont l'équipe spéciale l'a traité en 2008, éléments de preuve que je juge crédibles, je suis d'avis que le demandeur d'asile risque sérieusement d'être persécuté par les forces de sécurité de l'État. Étant donné que l'État est l'auteur de tels traitements, j'estime que le demandeur d'asile ne dispose d'aucune protection de l'État ni possibilité de refuge intérieur viable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Les questions en litige  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire soulève les questions suivantes:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 a) La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant à l'existence d'un lien entre la situation du défendeur et l'un des motifs reconnus par la Convention, conformément à l'article 96 de la LIPR?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 b) La décision de la SPR était-elle assez intelligible pour être raisonnable?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 La norme de contrôle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  La question du lien avec l'un des motifs de la Convention soulève une question mixte de fait et de droit. En l'espèce, cette question concerne l'existence d'un lien entre le « groupe social » et les « opinions politiques » au sens de la Convention et les circonstances factuelles propres au défendeur. Il s'ensuit que la norme de contrôle applicable est celle de la décision raisonnable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Les questions relatives à la suffisance et à l'intelligibilité des motifs sont également contrôlables selon la norme de la décision raisonnable. Voir

  Le demandeur soutient que la SPR a commis une erreur en concluant que le défendeur est un réfugié au sens de la Convention du seul fait de son lien avec le navire  
 Ocean Lady 
 . Le demandeur affirme que [traduction] « la SPR est arrivée à sa conclusion sans avoir effectué d'analyse approfondie au préalable et sans même avoir tiré la conclusion déterminante que le défendeur avait un lien avec l'un des cinq motifs énumérés dans la définition de réfugié au sens de la Convention », et qu'elle n'a donc pas satisfait aux exigences de l'article 96 de la LIPR. Par ailleurs, le demandeur fait valoir que les motifs de la SPR sont inintelligibles, de sorte que la décision n'est pas raisonnable, car une cour de révision ne comprendrait pas pourquoi la SPR a rendu cette décision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Au début de ses motifs, la SPR a estimé que le défendeur ne serait pas soupçonné d'avoir des liens avec les TLET. Pour cette raison, le demandeur soutient qu'il est illogique pour la SPR de conclure ensuite que le défendeur est soupçonné d'avoir des liens avec les TLET parce qu'il a été passager à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
 . Je ne puis accepter cet argument. Je ne décèle aucune incohérence dans les conclusions de la SPR. Au paragraphe 37 de ses motifs, la SPR indique clairement que sa première conclusion est liée au fait que le défendeur présentait un profil susceptible d'attirer l'attention des autorités sri-lankaises avant son départ du Sri Lanka, ou après son arrivée au Canada. C'est uniquement en raison de toute la publicité entourant le voyage du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
  du fait qu'il appartenait aux TLET, de son histoire et de la présence d'un passager soupçonné de faire partie des TLET, que la SPR a conclu qu'un lien entre le défendeur et les TLET était établi. Ces circonstances sont compatibles avec une demande d'asile sur place.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  Le principal argument du demandeur est que la seule raison pour laquelle la SPR a accueilli la demande d'asile est que le défendeur était un migrant arrivé à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
 . À mon avis, les motifs de la SPR en disent bien davantage. Comme il a été résumé précédemment, la SPR admet que le défendeur est un Tamoul originaire du Nord du Sri Lanka ayant voyagé sur le navire  
 Ocean Lady 
 , navire appartenant aux TLET, en compagnie de 76 autres hommes tamouls, dont au moins un passager faisant bel et bien partie des TLET. Ces conclusions de la SPR établissent le contexte et les circonstances qui l'ont amenée à rendre une décision favorable au sujet de la demande. Ainsi, il n'est pas juste d'affirmer que la décision de la SPR repose sur le fait que le défendeur est un migrant ayant voyagé à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
 . Le fondement de la décision de la SPR, qui se reflète de ses motifs, est plutôt que le défendeur a un lien avec l'un des motifs de la Convention, soit les opinions politiques présumées, parce qu'il est un Tamoul originaire du Nord du Sri Lanka ayant voyagé en compagnie de passagers soupçonnés d'avoir des liens avec les TLET à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
 , navire des Tigres tamouls auparavant utilisé pour le trafic d'armes. De plus, la SPR a indiqué dans ses motifs que le témoignage d'expert avait établi que toutes les personnes qui avaient voyagé à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
  « ont un profil correspondant au profil typique des terroristes des TLET » et a souligné qu'il n'y avait ni femmes ni enfants à bord du navire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  La SPR conclut « [qu'] à cause du temps que le demandeur d'asile a passé à bord du navire, prétendument en compagnie d'une personne ayant fait l'objet d'une notice rouge d'INTERPOL, les autorités l'auraient recherché pour lui poser des questions bien précises en ce qui concerne sa connaissance, réelle ou présumée, d'agents des TLET ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Le demandeur soutient que la conclusion qui précède établit tout au plus que les autorités sri-lankaises croient que le défendeur pourrait posséder des renseignements au sujet des TLET ou d'un suspect recherché par INTERPOL parce qu'il a été passager à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
 . Le demandeur fait valoir qu'une jurisprudence abondante appuie la proposition selon laquelle un demandeur d'asile qui craint d'être persécuté uniquement parce qu'il est soupçonné de connaître des renseignements sur une organisation terroriste ou criminelle - plutôt que d'en partager les opinions politiques - n'a pas de lien avec le motif relatif aux « opinions politiques » prévu à la Convention.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  J'admets que la conclusion de la SPR, reproduite ci-dessus, aurait pu être formulée plus clairement et aurait dû porter sur la conclusion relative aux liens soupçonnés avec les TLET plutôt que sur celle relative aux connaissances présumées au sujet des TLET. Néanmoins, au paragraphe 32 de ses motifs, la SPR a conclu que « [l] e fait que le demandeur d'asile est un Tamoul et son lien avec le navire  
 Ocean Lady 
  sont incontestables ». Elle a également estimé que l'État sri-lankais soupçonnerait le défendeur d'avoir des liens potentiels avec les TLET. Ces conclusions, combinées à d'autres éléments de preuve qui associent le voyage du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
  aux TLET, suffisent pour conclure à l'existence d'un lien avec les opinions politiques. De plus, même si la SPR n'a pas expressément établi de lien avec la race, un tel lien peut être déduit de ses motifs. La SPR a fait maintes fois référence à des documents traitant de la situation des Tamouls rapatriés et des risques auxquels ils sont exposés, particulièrement ceux originaires du Nord du Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  La Cour suprême, au paragraphe 48 de l'arrêt  
 Dunsmuir 
 , a souscrit au point de vue selon lequel, au moment de contrôler une décision selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, une cour doit porter « une attention respectueuse aux motifs donnés  
 ou qui pourraient être donnés 
  à l'appui d'une décision ». Le juge Evans a confirmé ce point de vue dans ses motifs dissidents dans  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (motifs auxquels la Cour suprême du Canada a ensuite souscrit dans  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Voici ce qu'il a écrit, au paragraphe 164 de ses motifs:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Les mots soulignés indiquent qu'on ne doit pas aborder le contrôle judiciaire sous un angle trop formaliste. Ainsi, dans la mesure où le Tribunal n'explique pas pleinement certains aspects de sa décision, la Cour peut se reporter aux éléments de preuve cités par le Tribunal pour étoffer ses motifs. Je ne considère cependant pas l'arrêt  
 Dunsmuir 
  comme une invitation faite à la cour de révision d'usurper le rôle qui incombe au tribunal de justifier ses décisions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Je suis d'avis que les motifs que la SPR a donnés pour établir un lien avec les « opinions politiques » démontrent de façon satisfaisante « la justification de la décision, [...] la transparence et [...] l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel ». Voir  
 Dunsmuir 
 , au paragraphe 47. Selon moi, la preuve relative aux circonstances entourant le voyage du défendeur à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
  suffit à soutenir la conclusion de la SPR, nonobstant les lacunes précédemment relevées dans ses motifs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  Après la lecture de l'ensemble des motifs, j'estime que la SPR pouvait raisonnablement conclure, sur la foi du dossier dont elle disposait, que le défendeur sera soupçonné d'avoir des opinions politiques contraires à celles du gouvernement sri-lankais.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  D'après les conclusions de fait relatives à la demande d'asile sur place que la SPR a exposées dans ses motifs ainsi que de la preuve documentaire sur le traitement des rapatriés dans une situation similaire, la SPR pouvait raisonnablement conclure que le défendeur risquerait sérieusement d'être persécuté par les représentants de l'État à son retour au Sri Lanka en raison de ses opinions politiques présumées.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  Si la conclusion susmentionnée permet de trancher la demande, il m'apparaît néanmoins utile de me pencher maintenant sur la conclusion de la SPR relativement à l'appartenance à un « groupe social ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Selon le demandeur, la conclusion à laquelle la SPR est parvenue, soit que le voyage à bord du navire  
 Ocean Lady 
  du défendeur tamoul est un fait historique indiscutable qui témoigne de l'appartenance du défendeur à un « groupe social », est contraire à la jurisprudence établie quant à la portée de l'expression « groupe social ». Le demandeur affirme que le fait de s'embarquer volontairement pour le Canada à bord d'un navire transportant des passagers clandestins ne s'inscrit aucunement dans le cadre de la défense des droits de la personne et de la lutte contre la discrimination, et ne tombe dans aucune catégorie décrite dans  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  Il est incontestable que le fait d'être un simple passager à bord d'un navire à destination du Canada en provenance du Sri Lanka, en soi, n'établit pas l'appartenance à un « groupe social » au sens de l'article 96 de la LIPR. À la page 739 de  
 Ward 
 , le juge La Forest aborde la question du sens à donner à l'expression « groupe social »: « Le sens donné à l'expression "groupe social" dans la Loi devrait tenir compte des thèmes sous-jacents généraux de la défense des droits de la personne et de la lutte contre la discrimination qui viennent justifier l'initiative internationale de protection des réfugiés. »  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge La Forest, commentant les motifs qu'il a rendus dans  
 Ward 
 , a déclaré que « [l] es "thèmes sous-jacents généraux de la défense des droits de la personne et de la lutte contre la discrimination" [...] doivent demeurer le facteur primordial en vue de la détermination de l'appartenance du demandeur à un groupe social ». En l'espèce, la SPR a omis, dans ses motifs, d'effectuer cette première étape de l'analyse requise pour déterminer si le défendeur pouvait être classé dans un groupe social particulier. Je ne suis pas disposé à interpréter une telle analyse. La lacune ne porte cependant pas un coup fatal à la décision, car, comme il a été mentionné, la SPR a tiré des conclusions raisonnables quant à la crainte de persécution du répondant en raison de ses opinions politiques présumées.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  Je vais maintenant me pencher sur le dernier point soulevé par le demandeur, à savoir que les motifs de la SPR ne sont pas raisonnables parce qu'ils sont inintelligibles. En ce qui concerne la question déterminante, le lien avec les opinions politiques, je suis convaincu que les motifs permettent à la Cour de comprendre pourquoi la SPR a rendu une telle décision et lui permettent de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables. Voir  
 Newfoundland Nurses' Union 
 , au paragraphe 16. Les motifs auraient pu être plus détaillés et plus clairs en ce qui concerne certains éléments constitutifs, mais j'estime qu'ils sont suffisamment clairs pour permettre à la Cour de procéder à un contrôle de la décision. Par conséquent, l'argument du demandeur est rejeté. La décision est raisonnable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  En raison des motifs susmentionnés, la demande de contrôle judiciaire sera rejetée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  Les parties ont eu la possibilité de soulever une question grave de portée générale au sens de l'alinéa 74 
 d 
 ) de la  
 Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés 
 , L.C. 2001, ch. 27, et elles ne l'ont pas fait. Je suis convaincu que la présente affaire ne soulève aucune question de ce genre. En conséquence, je n'ai pas l'intention de certifier une question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

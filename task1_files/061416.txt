I.
Facts
[1]
de Montigny, J.
: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (Act) for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board. In a decision dated December 16, 2008, the RPD found that Yadhwinder Singh Nijjer (the applicant) was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the Act and therefore rejected his refugee protection claim.
[2]
The applicant is an Indian citizen of the Sikh religion, originally from the Rampur district in the State of Uttranchal.
[3]
According to the applicant, Sikh extremists came to the family farm in August 2004 and forced his family at gunpoint to give them lodging and food. They allegedly left the next day, ordering the family not to say anything.
[4]
On August 13, 2004, police officers apparently descended on the family farm. The applicant allegedly fled, but the police officers, believing that he had sided with the extremists, demanded that he be brought to the police station, which he was.
[5]
According to the applicant, he was detained for four days, the police officers accusing him of supporting the extremists. Since he refused to admit this, the police officers allegedly beat and tortured him. Apparently, they finally released him after receiving a bribe of 40,000 rupees, and he was treated by a physician.
[6]
However, the police officers purportedly continued to harass the applicant and his family. On May 25, 2005, a few days after terrorist attacks attributed to the Sikh extremists, the police apparently arrested the applicant again. Once again, since he refused to admit that he knew the persons responsible for the attacks, he allegedly was tortured. He was apparently released six days later, after the payment of another bribe of 60,000 rupees.
[7]
The applicant apparently then went to live and work at the home of an uncle in the State of Punjab. The police allegedly continued to harass his family and arrested and beat his brother. His uncle was concerned and apparently asked him to leave.
[8]
The applicant then purportedly went to New Delhi. His family allegedly contacted an agent who prepared a student visa application for the applicant. Once he obtained his visa, the applicant went to Canada. He arrived here on December 20, 2005, and filed his refugee protection claim on November 29, 2006.
A.
The RPD decision
[9]
From the outset, the RPD identified the question of the applicant's credibility as the issue determinative of his refugee protection claim. It did not find the applicant credible and rejected his refugee protection claim. The RPD took the following factors, among others, into account:
a. The contradictions between the information provided by the applicant in support of the student visa application that he signed and the information that he provided in support of his refugee protection claim, particularly with regard to his arrests in India;
b. The absence of medical documents confirming that the applicant was the victim of torture, whether they be documents from the physician who allegedly treated the applicant in India or documents from a Canadian physician or psychologist. The RPD noted that the applicant had stated at the hearing that he did not suffer from any after-effects, whether physical or psychological, from the torture he claims to have undergone. The RPD, while stating that it is aware of the difficulty a victim may have in talking about the torture he or she has been subjected to, found such a complete absence of after-effects to be implausible;
c. The fact that the applicant never - even when he was living in Delhi - reported the mistreatment he allegedly received to the authorities or to non-governmental organizations. According to the RPD, this diminishes the applicant's credibility with regard to the issue of his fear of persecution;
d. The fact that the applicant did not submit his refugee protection claim until eleven months after his arrival in Canada. According to the RPD, this delay also affects the applicant's credibility with regard to the issue of his subjective fear of persecution.
[10]
Finally, the RPD did not attach any probative value to the affidavit of Sarpanch Baljinder Singh, a member of the applicant's native village council, even though it corroborated the applicant's statements. According to the RPD, this affidavit was merely a repetition of a version of the facts that it did not find credible in the first place.
i.
Issue
[11]
The only issue in this judicial review is whether the RPD erred in finding that the applicant was not credible.
III.
Standard of review
[12]
Since the issue is the RPD's assessment of the applicant's credibility, the applicable standard of review is reasonableness: see, for example,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] F.C.J. No. 515. Consequently, what this Court needs to determine is not so much whether it would have arrived at the same conclusion as the RPD, but whether the decision falls within "a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] S.C.J. No. 9, at paragraph 47.
IV.
Analysis
[13]
The applicant raised several arguments against the RPD's decision. Although some of these arguments are more persuasive than others, the fact remains that an applicant who is seeking to have a decision about his or her credibility set aside bears a heavy burden. As Justice Mackay pointed out in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Questions of credibility and weight of evidence are for the CRDD panel in considering refugee claims. Thus, the panel may reject uncontradicted evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole, or where inconsistencies are found in the evidence or it is found to be implausible. Particularly where there has been an oral hearing and the panel's assessment appears clearly dependent, as in this case, at least in part, upon seeing and hearing the witness, this Court will not intervene unless it is satisfied that the panel's conclusion is based on irrelevant considerations or that it ignored evidence of significance. In short, its decision must be found to be patently unreasonable on the basis of the evidence before the panel.
[14]
In this case, the RPD considered the applicant's testimony and found that it was not credible for several reasons. The RPD's findings do not appear to me to be based on irrelevant considerations and do not ignore evidence of significance.
[15]
First, the applicant contended that the contradictions between his student visa application and the information he provided when he submitted his refugee protection claim do not undermine his credibility. In fact, he argued that these contradictions are entirely normal, since the agents who prepare visa applications in India generally use such schemes in order to obtain a visa for their clients. The applicant merely signed the visa application prepared by the agent.
[16]
The visa application may have been completed by a third party, and the person who completed it may have chosen not to mention the applicant's arrests so as not to harm his chances of obtaining the visa. But as the RPD pointed out, the applicant nevertheless signed the visa application and certified that all the information provided was complete and true. In these circumstances, the RPD was entitled to find that the contradictions between his visa application and the version he provided in his Personal Information Form (PIF) undermined his credibility. Given the applicant's level of education, the RPD was entitled to doubt his contention at the hearing that he had not read the visa application form submitted to the Canadian consular authorities.
[17]
Moreover, the applicant asserted that he had not provided a medical report confirming that he had been the victim of torture because the physician who treated him in India categorically refused to give him a written report. He put in evidence, in support of his claims, a report from Amnesty International describing the pressures placed on Indian physicians who are called upon to treat victims of torture. As for the absence of any report from a Canadian physician or psychologist, the applicant stated that he had not thought of consulting a health professional since his arrival in Canada since he no longer felt any after-effects from the torture to which he was subjected.
[18]
It is true that Rule 7 of the
Refugee Protection Division Rules
(SOR/2002-228) provides that a claimant who does not provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim "must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them". The RPD rejected the applicant's explanation on the ground that his refugee protection claim was confidential, implying that the Indian physician who treated him had no reason to fear reprisals from the authorities in his country. This finding appears unreasonable to me, since Indian physicians are not necessarily familiar with the procedure for refugee protection claims in Canada, and may reasonably fear that a written report would be turned against them despite all assurances that the applicant could give.
[19]
However, the explanation given for not providing a report from a Canadian professional seems much less plausible. The applicant relied, among others, on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to argue that he did not have to submit such evidence. However, in that case, there was uncontradicted evidence that the claimant had indeed sustained an injury such as the one he had described, and that he had had to undergo two operations in Canada to treat it. He only needed confirmation of the very specific nature of his injury. In this context, the Court of Appeal ruled that this deficiency was not sufficient to undermine the applicant's credibility. That is not the case here.
[20]
The applicant's claim that the RPD acted outside of its expertise in finding that it was not plausible that the applicant did not experience any after-effects from the torture he allegedly underwent cannot be accepted. The RPD is a specialized tribunal, whose members assess the cases of many people who have been subjected to mistreatment or torture. Based upon that experience, the RPD panel was entitled to doubt the fact that the applicant, unlike most people in his situation, did not have any physical or psychological after-effects from the torture he claims to have undergone.
[21]
The applicant also argued that his failure to seek protection from the Delhi police can be explained by his generalized fear of police after his arrests. He claimed that the RPD erred in rejecting this explanation and asserting that the police officers in Delhi were obviously not the same as those who arrested him in his native region.
[22]
It is obvious to me in reading the RPD's reasons that the panel properly understood the applicant's argument that all Indian police officers are cut from the same cloth and are not trustworthy. It would, to say the least, be demeaning and wrong to consider that the RPD confined itself to observing that New Delhi police officers are not the same as the police officers in the State of Uttaranchal. Obviously, the RPD considered that the applicant had not proved that he had tried to seek state protection before coming to Canada to claim refugee protection, since it is not sufficient to claim that all the security forces in a country are corrupt without even asking for their assistance. This is all the more true in a vast country such as India, where the police officers in the capital city have no relationship with those who presumably tortured the applicant and have no interest in protecting them. In any case, the question of the possibility of obtaining state protection in India is not really relevant since the very existence of the applicant's persecution and subjective fear has not been established, given the applicant's lack of credibility.
[23]
Finally, the applicant argued that the RPD erred in holding against him the delay in claiming refugee protection. Since he did not have to worry about being deported because he had a visa that was valid for one year, it was normal for him to explore other more promising possibilities for staying in Canada (including marriage), especially given that the chances of obtaining refugee status were very slim.
[24]
It is trite law that a delay in submitting a refugee protection claim, while not decisive, remains a relevant element that the tribunal may take into account in assessing both the statements and the actions and deeds of a claimant:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The claimant knew upon his arrival in Canada that he was only authorized to stay in Canada for a specific and limited period of time. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable to expect that he would regularize his status as soon as possible if he truly feared for his life and physical integrity in India.
[25]
Finally, the applicant is claiming that the RPD did not consider all of the evidence in refusing to attach any probative value to the sarpanch's affidavit. Relying on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 1500, he argued that all of the evidence must be taken into account before a tribunal can arrive at a negative finding with regard to the credibility of a witness.
[26]
Despite the RPD's duty to consider all of the evidence, the finding that a claimant has no credibility may extend to all of the evidence he or she submits. This is what the Court of Appeal recognized in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 302. In dismissing evidence that merely repeated a version of the facts considered to be not very credible and improbable, the RPD did not err or breach the general rule that all evidence must be considered before ruling on the credibility of an applicant's account. In this case, the RPD was entitled to consider that the sarpanch's documentary evidence was not sufficient to make an account that otherwise appeared in many respects to be implausible credible.
[27]
For all these reasons, the RPD's finding as to the applicant's lack of credibility does not appear to me to be unreasonable. Certainly, the applicant took every possible step to enter into and stay in Canada by filing a false visa application, by foreseeing the possibility of a marriage, and by claiming refugee protection as a last resort. The panel was no less entitled to find that the applicant did not establish that his wish to stay in Canada was based on a real fear of escaping persecution in India.
[28]
Counsel did not propose any question for certification, and none will be certified.
JUDGMENT
[29]
FOR THESE REASONS, the application for judicial review is dismissed. No question is certified.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  J.
[Translation]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, L.C. 2001, c. 27 (la « Loi »), d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la « SPR ») présentée. Dans une décision rendue le 16 décembre 2008, la SPR a conclu que Yadhwinder Singh Nijjer (le demandeur) n'était ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention ni une personne à protéger en vertu de l'article 97 de la Loi et a donc rejeté sa demande d'asile.
[2]
Le demandeur est un citoyen indien de religion sikh, originaire du district de Rampur dans l'État d'Uttranchal.
[3]
Selon le demandeur, des extrémistes sikhs seraient venus à la ferme familiale en août 2004 et auraient, sous la menace d'armes à feu, forcé sa famille à les héberger et à leur donner de la nourriture. Ils seraient repartis le lendemain, ordonnant à la famille de garder le silence.
[4]
Le 13 août 2004, les policiers auraient fait une descente à la ferme familiale. Le demandeur se serait enfui, mais les policiers, croyant qu'il avait pris le parti des extrémistes, auraient exigé qu'on l'amène au poste de police, ce qui fut fait.
[5]
Selon le demandeur, il aurait été détenu pendant quatre jours, les policiers l'accusant de soutenir les extrémistes. Comme il refusait de l'admettre, les policiers l'auraient battu et torturé. Il aurait finalement été libéré, grâce au paiement d'un pot-de-vin de 40 000 roupies, et soigné par un médecin.
[6]
Les policiers auraient cependant continué de harceler le demandeur et sa famille. Le 25 mai 2005, quelques jours après des attentats terroristes imputés aux extrémistes sikhs, les policiers auraient de nouveau arrêté le demandeur. Encore une fois, comme il refusait d'admettre qu'il connaissait les responsables des attentats, il aurait été torturé. Il aurait été libéré six jours plus tard, suite au paiement d'un nouveau pot-de-vin de 60 000 roupies.
[7]
Le demandeur se serait alors rendu vivre et travailler chez un oncle, dans l'État du Penjab. Les policiers auraient continué à harceler sa famille et auraient arrêté et battu son frère et son frère. Son oncle, inquiet, lui aurait demandé de partir.
[8]
Le demandeur se serait alors rendu à New Delhi. Sa famille aurait contacté un agent qui aurait préparé une demande de visa étudiant pour le demandeur. Une fois le visa obtenu, le demandeur s'est rendu au Canada. Il est arrivé le 20 décembre 2005, et a présenté sa demande d'asile le 29 novembre 2006.
A.
La decision de la SPR
[9]
D'emblée, la SPR a identifié la question de la crédibilité du demandeur comme l'enjeu déterminant de sa demande de statut de réfugié. Elle n'a pas trouvé le demandeur crédible et a rejeté sa demande d'asile. La SPR a notamment tenu compte des facteurs suivants:
a. Les contradictions entre les renseignements fournis par le demandeur au soutien de la demande de visa d'étudiant qu'il avait signée et ceux fournis au soutien de sa demande d'asile, notamment en ce qui concerne ses arrestations en Inde;
b. L'absence de documents médicaux confirmant que le demandeur a été victime de torture, qu'il s'agisse de documents provenant du médecin qui aurait soigné le demandeur en Inde ou d'un médecin ou d'un psychologue canadien. La SPR a noté que le demandeur avait affirmé à l'audience n'avoir gardé aucune séquelle, physique ou psychologique, de la torture qu'il affirme avoir subie. La SPR, tout en se disant sensible à la difficulté qu'une victime peut avoir à parler de la torture subie, a estimé qu'une telle absence complète de séquelles n'était pas plausible;
c. Le fait que le demandeur n'a jamais - même lorsqu'il vivait à Delhi - rapporté aux autorités ou à des organismes non-gouvernementaux les mauvais traitements qu'il aurait subis. Selon la SPR, cela diminue la crédibilité du demandeur sur la question de sa crainte de persécution;
d. Le fait que le demandeur n'a présenté sa demande d'asile que onze mois après son arrivée au Canada. Selon la SPR, ce délai entache également la crédibilité du demandeur sur la question de sa crainte subjective de persécution.
[10]
Enfin, la SPR n'a pas accordé de force probante à l'affidavit du serpanch Baljinder Singh, membre du conseil du village natal du demandeur, même s'il corroborait les dires de ce dernier. Aux yeux de la SPR, cet affidavit ne faisait que répéter une version des faits qu'elle ne trouvait pas crédible au premier chef.
II.
La question en litige
[11]
La seule question en litige dans la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est celle de savoir si la SPR a erré en concluant que le demandeur n'était pas crédible.
III.
La norme de contrôle
[12]
La question en litige étant celle de l'évaluation par la SPR de la crédibilité du demandeur, la norme de contrôle applicable est celle de la décision raisonnable: voir, par ex.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] A.C.F. no 515. Par voie de conséquence, l'évaluation à laquelle doit procéder cette Cour n'est pas tant celle de savoir si elle en serait venue à la même conclusion que la SPR, mais bien plutôt de déterminer si la décision fait partie des « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] A.C.S. no 9, au para. 47.
IV.
Analyse
[13]
Le demandeur a soulevé plusieurs arguments à l'encontre de la décision de la SPR. Bien que certains de ces arguments soient plus convaincants que d'autres, il n'en demeure pas moins que le demandeur qui cherche à faire renverser une décision portant sur sa crédibilité assume un lourd fardeau. Comme le soulignait le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au par. 13:
Il appartient à la formation de jugement de la section du statut d'apprécier la crédibilité et la force probante des preuves et témoignages, dans son instruction des revendications du statut de réfugié. C'est ainsi qu'elle peut rejeter des preuves non réfutées si elles ne sont pas compatibles avec les probabilités propres à l'affaire prise dans son ensemble, si elle relève des contradictions dans le témoignage ou si elle juge celui-ci invraisemblable. Dans le cas où il y a eu une audience de vive voix et que l'appréciation de la formation de jugement est, comme en l'espèce, clairement subordonnée, du moins en partie, au fait qu'elle voit et entend le témoin, la Cour n'interviendra pas à moins de conclure que la formation de jugement fonde sa décision sur des considérations étrangères à l'affaire ou ignore des preuves dignes d'attention. En bref, la Cour n'interviendra que si elle juge la décision manifestement déraisonnable au regard des éléments de preuve produits.
[14]
Dans la présente instance, la SPR a considéré le témoignage du demandeur et a conclu que celui-ci n'était pas crédible pour plusieurs raisons. Les conclusions de la SPR ne m'apparaissent pas fondées sur des considérations étrangères à l'affaire et n'ignorent aucun élément de preuve pertinent.
[15]
Le demandeur a tout d'abord soutenu que les contradictions entre sa demande de visa étudiant et les renseignements qu'il a fournis en présentant sa demande de statut de réfugié ne portent pas atteinte à sa crédibilité. En fait, ces contradictions seraient tout à fait normales, les agents qui préparent les demandes de visa en Inde ayant généralement recours à de tels stratagèmes pour obtenir un visa pour leur client. Le demandeur n'aurait fait que signer la demande de visa préparée par l'agent.
[16]
Il se peut bien que la demande de visa ait été complétée par un tiers, et que la personne qui l'a remplie ait choisie de ne pas mentionner les arrestations du demandeur pour ne pas nuire à ses chances d'obtenir le visa. Mais comme le souligne la SPR, le demandeur n'en a pas moins signé la demande de visa et attesté que tous les renseignements fournis étaient complets et véridiques. Dans ces circonstances, la SPR pouvait conclure que les contradictions entre sa demande de visa et la version qu'il a fournie dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) minaient sa crédibilité. Compte tenu du niveau d'éducation du demandeur, la SPR pouvait douter du fait qu'il n'avait pas lu le formulaire de demande de visa qu'il a soumis aux autorités consulaires canadiennes, comme il l'a soutenu lors de l'audition.
[17]
Le demandeur a par ailleurs soutenu qu'il n'avait pas fourni de rapport médical confirmant qu'il avait été victime de torture parce que le médecin qui l'a traité en Inde refusait catégoriquement de lui remettre un rapport écrit. Il a mis en preuve, à l'appui de ses prétentions, un rapport d'Amnistie Internationale décrivant les pressions auxquelles sont soumis les médecins indiens appelés à soigner des victimes de torture. Quant à l'absence de tout rapport provenant d'un médecin ou d'un psychologue canadien, le demandeur a affirmé qu'il n'avait pas songé à consulter un professionnel de la santé depuis son arrivée au Canada puisqu'il ne ressentait plus aucune séquelle de la torture dont il aurait fait l'objet.
[18]
Il est vrai que la Règle 7 des
Règles de la Division de la protection des réfugiés
(DORS/2002-228) prévoit que le demandeur d'asile, s'il ne peut transmettre des documents acceptables pour établir son identité et les autres éléments de sa demande, « en donne la raison et indique quelles mesures il a prises pour s'en procurer ». Or, la SPR a rejeté l'explication du demandeur au motif que sa demande de protection était confidentielle, laissant sous-entendre que le médecin indien l'ayant traité n'avait aucune raison de craindre les représailles des autorités de son pays. Cette conclusion m'apparaît déraisonnable, dans la mesure où les médecins indiens ne connaissent pas nécessairement la procédure entourant les demandes pour obtenir le statut de réfugié au Canada, et peuvent raisonnablement craindre qu'un rapport écrit de leur main se retourne contre eux malgré toutes les assurances qu'aurait pu leur donner le demandeur.
[19]
En revanche, l'explication fournie pour ne pas fournir de rapport d'un professionnel canadien apparaît beaucoup moins plausible. Le demandeur s'est notamment appuyé sur l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  pour soutenir qu'il ne lui était pas nécessaire de déposer une telle preuve. Or, dans cette affaire, il existait une preuve non-contredite que le requérant avait effectivement subi une blessure comme celle qu'il avait décrite, et qu'il avait dû subir deux opérations chirurgicales au Canada pour la soigner. Il ne lui manquait qu'une confirmation de la nature très précise de sa blessure. Dans ce contexte, la Cour d'appel a jugé que cette lacune n'était pas suffisante pour entacher la crédibilité du demandeur. Tel n'était pas le cas en l'espèce.
[20]
Quant à la prétention du demandeur à l'effet que la SPR a outrepassé son expertise en concluant qu'il n'était pas plausible que le demandeur n'ait gardé aucune séquelle de la torture qu'il aurait subie, elle ne peut être retenue. La SPR est un tribunal spécialisé, dont les membres évaluent le cas de nombreuses personnes ayant subi de mauvais traitements ou de la torture. Fort de cette expérience, le Membre de la SPR pouvait douter du fait que le demandeur, contrairement à la plupart des personnes dans sa situation, n'aurait pas gardé la moindre séquelle physique ou psychologique de la torture qu'il prétend avoir subie.
[21]
Le demandeur a également soutenu que son défaut de demander la protection de la police de Delhi s'explique par sa crainte généralisée de la police suite à ses arrestations. La SPR aurait eu tort de rejeter cette explication en affirmant que les policiers ne sont manifestement pas les mêmes à Delhi que ceux qui ont procédé à son arrestation dans sa région natale.
[22]
Il me semble évident à la lecture des motifs de la SPR que le Membre avait bien saisi l'argument du demandeur, selon qui tous les policiers indiens sont de la même mouture et ne sont pas dignes de confiance. Il serait pour le moins réducteur et erroné de considérer que la SPR s'en est tenue à constater que les policiers de New Delhi ne sont pas les mêmes personnes que les policiers de l'État d'Uttaranchal. Il est clair que la SPR a jugé que le demandeur n'avait pas fait la preuve qu'il avait cherché à obtenir la protection de l'État avant de venir se réfugier au Canada, dans la mesure où il ne suffit pas de prétendre que toutes les forces de l'ordre du pays sont corrompues sans même revendiquer leur aide. Cela sera d'autant plus vrai dans un vaste pays comme l'Inde, où les policiers de la capitale n'ont aucun lien avec ceux qui auraient présumément torturé le demandeur et n'ont aucun intérêt à les protéger. Quoi qu'il en soit, la question de la possibilité d'obtenir la protection de l'État en Inde n'est pas vraiment pertinente puisque c'est l'existence même de la persécution et de la crainte subjective du demandeur qui n'a pas été établie étant donné le manque de crédibilité de ce dernier.
[23]
Enfin, le demandeur a fait valoir que la SPR avait eu tort de retenir contre lui le délai qu'il a mis à revendiquer le statut de réfugié. Comme il n'avait pas à s'inquiéter d'être déporté puisqu'il avait un visa valide pour un an, il était normal qu'il explore d'autres possibilités plus prometteuses pour rester au Canada (et notamment le mariage), d'autant plus que les probabilités d'obtenir le statut de réfugié sont très minces.
[24]
Or, il est de jurisprudence constante que le retard à présenter une demande d'asile, sans être déterminant, demeure un élément pertinent dont le tribunal peut tenir compte pour apprécier les dires ainsi que les faits et gestes d'un revendicateur:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Le requérant savait dès son arrivée au Canada qu'il n'était autorisé à demeurer au Canada que pour une durée précise et limitée. Dans ces circonstances, il était raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'il régularise son statut le plus tôt possible s'il craignait vraiment pour sa vie et son intégrité physique en Inde.
[25]
Finalement, le demandeur prétend que la SPR n'a pas considéré l'ensemble de la preuve en refusant d'accorder toute force probante à l'affidavit du serpanch. S'appuyant sur l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] A.C.F. no 1500, il a fait valoir que tous les éléments de preuve doivent être pris en considération avant qu'un tribunal puisse en arriver à une conclusion négative quant à la crédibilité d'un témoin.
[26]
Malgré l'obligation qui incombe à la SPR de considérer l'ensemble de la preuve, il arrive que la conclusion à l'effet qu'un revendicateur n'a aucune crédibilité puisse s'étendre à tous les éléments de preuve qu'il a soumis. C'est ce que la Cour d'appel a reconnu dans les affaires
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] A.C.F. no. 302. En rejetant un élément de preuve qui ne faisait que répéter une version des faits considérée comme étant peu crédible et improbable, la SPR n'a pas erré ou contrevenu à la règle générale voulant que toute la preuve doive être considérée avant de se prononcer sur la crédibilité du récit exposé par un demandeur. En l'occurrence, la SPR pouvait considérer que la preuve documentaire du serpanch n'était pas suffisante pour rendre crédible un récit qui lui apparaissait par ailleurs invraisemblable à plusieurs égards.
[27]
Pour tous ces motifs, la conclusion de la SPR quant au manque de crédibilité du demandeur ne m'apparaît pas déraisonnable. Certes, le demandeur a pris tous les moyens pour entrer et demeurer au Canada, en déposant une demande de visa mensongère, en envisageant la possibilité d'un mariage, et en demandant l'asile comme solution de dernier recours. Elle n'en était pas moins autorisée à conclure que le demandeur n'a pas établi que son désir de rester au Canada reposait sur une crainte véritable d'échapper à la persécution en Inde.
[28]
Les procureurs n'ont proposé aucune question pour fins de certification, et aucune ne sera certifiée.

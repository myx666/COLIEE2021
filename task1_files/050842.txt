O'Keefe, J.
: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act) for judicial review of a decision by a Citizenship and Immigration Canada officer (the officer) dated February 16, 2011, wherein the applicant's permanent residence application was refused (the decision). This conclusion was based on the officer's finding that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds to warrant an exception allowing the applicant's permanent residence application to be made from within Canada.
[2]
The applicant requests that the officer's decision be set aside and the application be referred back to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) for redetermination by a different officer.
Background
[3]
The applicant was born in St. Lucia in 1994. She does not know who her father is and only met him once at 11 years of age. She had a difficult childhood in Ciceron due to her mother leaving her at home alone while working, difficulty with schooling and fear of crime.
[4]
She arrived in Canada on September 10, 2005. Her mother remained in St. Lucia and the applicant does not know her whereabouts. In Canada, she lived with her grand uncle and aunt. These relatives have provided her with every need and ensured that she gets the best education possible.
[5]
She has a sister who filed a successful H&C application, but no remaining family in St. Lucia. She does not know how she would survive alone upon a return to that country.
[6]
The applicant filed an H&C application on March 3, 2010.
Officer's Decision
[7]
In a letter dated February 16, 2011, the officer denied application for an exemption from the requirement to apply from within Canada on H&C grounds.
[8]
The officer listed the applicant's immigration history and briefly summarized the applicant's submissions. The officer noted the applicant's position that she would experience hardship if returned to St. Lucia due to not knowing the whereabouts of her parents and the applicant's statement that her grand uncle and aunt had filed adoption papers in St. Lucia. He also noted the applicant's submissions that her grand uncle and aunt are prepared to be her guardian and that she would be deprived of her education in St. Lucia.
[9]
In providing the rationale for rejecting the application, the officer noted that the applicant's grand uncle and aunt were both retirees and had a combined income of $24,000 in 2008. The officer noted that "[the applicant] has been attending school here in Canada and therefore her demands would be much greater in terms of finances than that of her grand uncle and aunt". Therefore, the applicant's relatives were not in a financial position to provide for her care and support in Canada. The officer found there was insufficient information to indicate that the applicant's adoption papers were in process or that her grand uncle and aunt have legal rights to be her guardian.
[10]
The officer did not see the credibility of the applicant being under the care of a distant relative when still a minor and due to the low income of her grand uncle and aunt. The officer noted the lack of other financial information such as a bank statement. The officer noted that the applicant has no close family ties in Canada upon whom she can depend for financial or emotional support and that she has her mother still residing in St. Lucia.
[11]
In assessing all the factors cumulatively, the officer was not satisfied the applicant would suffer hardship if returned to St. Lucia. The applicant had no close family ties in Canada and no one in Canada has legal custody of her. The officer was not satisfied that her grand uncle and aunt in Canada would be able to provide for her long term care and support.
Issues
[12]
The applicant submits the following points at issue:
1. Did the officer err in fact and law in failing to have any or proper regard to the relevant facts?
2. Was procedural fairness violated by the failure of the respondent to ensure the applicant's application was considered by the same officer as her sister's?
3. Was procedural fairness violated by the two sisters' applications coming to opposite results?
4. Did the officer violate procedural fairness by failing to communicate with the officer who decided the applicant's sister's application?
5. Did the officer err by failing to consider the best interests of the child?
6. Was the applicant's H&C application denied because of the incompetence of the applicant's representative and is it a reviewable error?
[13]
I would rephrase the issues as follows:
1. What is the appropriate standard of review?
2. Did the officer err in denying the application?
3. Did the officer breach procedural fairness?
Applicant's Written Submissions
[14]
The applicant submits that because the personal circumstances and hardship of she and her sister were substantially the same, they should have had the same outcome.
[15]
The applicant submits that the officer's finding that the applicant's grand uncle and aunt could not financially support the applicant is unreasonable because they had already been supporting the applicant since 2005. The officer's claim that there were no documents supporting the guardianship of the applicant, the applicant supplied a statutory declaration by her mother giving full custody to the applicant's grand uncle and aunt.
[16]
The applicant submits it is clear that the applicant's mother cannot support her and that she has a close bond with her grand uncle and aunt. There was no evidence that they could not support themselves. The officer drew an unreasonable conclusion without any analysis of income and expenses. Given that the applicant's mother cannot support her, the applicant should be with her grand uncle and aunt. If the officer did not request any further information about the income or expenses of the grand uncle and aunt, he should not have made the unreasonable inference they could not support the applicant.
[17]
It should have been clear to the officer that the applicant's grand uncle and aunt had provided long term care of the applicant for over six years and that the applicant had no contact with her mother during the same period. Returning a 17 year old to a country where she has no family to stay with and no means of support would be unusual, undeserved and disproportionate hardship.
[18]
The applicant's sister also submitted an H&C application. It is clear from the reasons for decision that the officer who made that decision recognized that her grand uncle and aunt were providing proper support to the applicant's sister and that she would not be able to live with her parents in St. Lucia. The applicant came to Canada at a younger age than her sister, making her case even stronger.
[19]
The applicant relies on several cases where this Court has quashed H&C decisions based on an officer's failure to properly consider all evidence. The applicant submits in this case the officer failed to consider the statutory declaration made by the applicant's mother and the fact that the applicant's grand uncle and aunt have supported her for seven years. This failure to consider relevant facts has resulted in a reviewable error of law.
Respondent's Written Submissions
[20]
The respondent submits that the applicant has not established that CIC was ever informed that the two sisters filed contemporaneous applications, as neither cover letter mentioned this issue. The two applications used different surnames. Neither sister listed each other on the portion of the application form for providing details of family members. The applicant's sister lists her adoptive mother and makes no mention of her biological mother. CIC therefore had no reason to join the applications. Therefore, the applicant's procedural fairness rights were not violated.
[21]
The respondent submits that an officer's assessment of an H&C application is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness, a deferential standard. Such assessments are highly discretionary and no particular outcome out of a wide scope of possible outcomes is guaranteed. When applications are not joined, they constitute individual assessments. The applicant has not given notice of the incompetency allegations to her former counsel so the Court cannot consider that argument.
[22]
The respondent argues that the officer's decision is reasonable on its face. The statutory declaration of the mother was not before the officer and only permitted the applicant to travel to Canada with the grand aunt and uncle and reside with them for the period of time required to meet adoption requirements. There was no formal granting of custody or guardianship.
[23]
The officer had concerns about the credibility of the applicant's statement that her mother abandoned her to the care of distance relatives who were retired and had low income. The officer focused on elements of the application that were problematic. No one had legal custody or guardianship of the applicant in Canada and the grand aunt and uncle provided little information about their finances. The respondent argues the applicant is asking the Court to reweigh the evidence but this is not the object of a judicial review.
[24]
While the applicant argues it was irrational to find that the relatives could not provide long term care, the respondent submits that the applicant provided limited financial information to establish that they could continue to provide such support. The onus was on the applicant to provide all evidence and information necessary. The onus does not shift to the officer to request further evidence.
[25]
The officer did not ignore the statutory declaration as it was not part of the application. Even if it had been in evidence, it does not indicate custody, only consent to the applicant travelling and residing with them temporarily. The officer was not incorrect in finding that custody had never been awarded.
[26]
The officer properly assessed the best interests of the child as his entire analysis was concerned with the applicant's interests. Therefore, the application should be dismissed.
Applicant's Further Written Submissions
[27]
The applicant submits the conduct of her representative was prejudicial to the applicant and that prejudice amounted to a violation of procedural fairness. If the officer had known that the applicant's mother had allowed the applicant's sister to be adopted in Canada, the applicant's own evidence would have been more credible. The representative was also incompetent by failing to inform the applicant that financial documents would be necessary to support her H&C claim. The applicant provided notice to the former immigration consultant.
Respondent's Further Written Submissions
[28]
The respondent argues the response provided by the applicant's former immigration consultant does not corroborate the applicant's evidence. Therefore, there is an insufficient factual basis for this Court to find the applicant was prejudiced by the actions of this consultant.
Analysis and Decision
[29]
Issue 1
What is the appropriate standard of review?
Where previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 57).
[30]
It is trite law that the appropriate standard of review for issues of procedural fairness is correctness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). No deference is owed to decision makers on these issues (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 50).
[31]
It is well established that assessments of an officer's decision on H&C applications for permanent residence from within Canada are reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2009] FCJ No 713;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2009] FCJ No 1489; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ No 868).
[32]
In reviewing the officer's decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the Board came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 47 and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 59). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, it is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (at paragraph 59).
[33]
Issue 2
Did the officer err in denying the application?
The applicant argues that the officer's decision was unreasonable because it did not properly consider the evidence of the applicant's dependence on her relatives since 2005 and her inability to provide for herself upon return to St. Lucia. Conversely, in arguing that the officer's decision was reasonable, the respondent relies predominantly on the significant deference owed to H&C decisions on judicial review. In considering the officer's decision, I examine it against the criteria of reasonableness: transparency, justifiability and intelligibility ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 47). H&C decisions are discretionary and have a large range of possible outcomes (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 353).
[34]
The officer's reliance on the family's low combined income in rejecting their ability to provide for the applicant is not transparent. There is no indication of why $24,000 per year is an inadequate amount, what amount would be adequate, or a reference to evidence on the cost of living in Toronto. This reasoning is completely opaque.
[35]
The officer also appears to treat the scenario of the applicant living with her relatives as a hypothetical: "[the applicant] has been attending school here in Canada and therefore her demands
would be
much greater in terms of finances" (emphasis added). The applicant's reliance on her relatives is not a hypothetical, since by her evidence she has been successfully living with them for six years. This evidence is clearly relevant to whether her relatives can support her financially and the officer gives no justification for why the applicant living with her relatives is analyzed as a change of course instead of a continuation of the status quo.
[36]
The officer is correct that there is no evidence of guardianship of the applicant by her relatives. That issue, however, is not determinative of this application. The applicant's evidence is that she does not know the whereabouts of her mother, so would be a completely abandoned minor if removed. Therefore, she argues that her situation in Canada should not be considered in absolute terms but in reference to the hardship she would faced if removed.
[37]
In response to this alleged hardship, the officer did "not see the credibility" of the applicant being sent from St. Lucia to Canada. Therefore, her application was only considered as if removal to St. Lucia would simply mean a return to the care of her mother. The officer offers no rationale for what makes the applicant's evidence implausible.
[38]
The officer's finding that the applicant has "no close family ties in Canada" is unintelligible, as is the repeated reference to the applicant's grand uncle and aunt as distant relatives. The officer does not set out what level of familial relation qualifies as sufficiently close or why these relatives, who have lived with and provided for the applicant for six years, fail this criterion.
[39]
For each of these findings, the evidence does not dictate a particular outcome and that is why it is the officer's role to consider the evidence and make findings. Even with due deference to that role, the reasons in this case simply do not explain why the officer came to these conclusions.
[40]
It is not the Court's role to reweigh the evidence in this application. It is, however, the Court's proper role to evaluate the decision for transparency, intelligibility and justifiability. In this case, the ability of the applicant's relatives to provide for her and whether she would be in the care of her mother if returned to St. Lucia were the two central factual issues of her application. On both issues, the officer offered only a bare finding and inadequate explanation. Even considering the decision in its totality and without isolating these individual issues, the decision fails to meet the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test.
[41]
Therefore, I find that the decision of the officer was unreasonable.
[42]
I need not deal with Issue 3 because of my finding on Issue 2.
[43]
The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is referred to a different officer for redetermination.
[44]
Neither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.
JUDGMENT
[45]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is allowed, the decision of the officer is set aside and the matter is referred to a different officer for redetermination.

.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), qui vise la décision datée du 16 février 2011 rendue par un agent de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (l'agent), par laquelle la demande de résidence permanente de la demanderesse a été rejetée (la décision). La décision était fondée sur la conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle il n'y avait pas suffisamment de considérations d'ordre humanitaire (CH) pour justifier une dispense permettant à la demanderesse de présenter sa demande de résidence permanente depuis le Canada.
[2]
La demanderesse souhaite que la décision de l'agent soit annulée et que l'affaire soit renvoyée à Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (CIC) pour qu'un autre agent statue à nouveau sur la demande.
Le contexte
[3]
La demanderesse est née à Sainte-Lucie en 1994. Elle n'a rencontré son père qu'une seule fois, alors qu'elle avait 11 ans, et ne le connaît pas. Elle a connu une enfance difficile à Ciceron, en raison du fait que sa mère la laissait seule à la maison pendant qu'elle travaillait, qu'elle avait des problèmes à l'école et qu'elle craignait d'être victime de criminalité.
[4]
Elle est arrivée au Canada le 10 septembre 2005. Sa mère est restée à Sainte-Lucie, et la demanderesse ne sait pas où elle se trouve. Au Canada, elle vivait avec son grand-oncle et sa grand-tante. Ces membres de sa famille lui ont fourni tout ce dont elle avait besoin et ils se sont assurés qu'elle obtienne la meilleure éducation possible.
[5]
Elle a une sœur, dont la demande CH a été accueillie, mais il ne lui reste plus de famille à Sainte-Lucie. Elle ne sait pas comment elle pourrait survivre seule dans l'éventualité où elle devait retourner dans ce pays.
[6]
La demanderesse a présenté une demande CH le 3 mars 2010.
La décision de l'agent
[7]
L'agent, par une lettre datée du 16 février 2011, a rejeté la demande de dispense de l'obligation de présenter une demande CH depuis le Canada.
[8]
L'agent a dressé la liste des antécédents de la demanderesse en matière d'immigration et a brièvement résumé les observations de la demanderesse. L'agent a relevé le point de vue de la demanderesse, selon lequel elle serait exposée à des difficultés si elle devait être renvoyée à Sainte-Lucie, en raison du fait qu'elle ne savait pas où se trouvaient ses parents ainsi que sa déclaration portant que son grand-oncle et sa grand-tante avaient déposé des documents d'adoption à Sainte-Lucie. Il a aussi souligné que la demanderesse avait mentionné dans ses observations que son grand-oncle et sa grand-tante étaient disposés à être ses tuteurs et qu'elle serait privée d'éducation à Sainte-Lucie.
[9]
L'agent, lorsqu'il a fourni la justification de son rejet de la demande, a mentionné que le grand-oncle et la grand-tante de la demanderesse étaient tous les deux à la retraite et que leur revenu combiné pour l'année 2008 était de 24 000 $. L'agent a noté que [traduction] « [la demanderesse] fréquentait l'école au Canada et que, par conséquent, elle serait, d'un point de vue financier, un fardeau beaucoup plus important que les ressources dont disposent son grand-oncle et sa grand-tante ».Par conséquent, les membres de la famille de la demanderesse ne pouvaient, d'un point de vue financier, subvenir à ses besoins au Canada. L'agent a conclu qu'il n'y avait pas assez de renseignements indiquant que les documents d'adoption de la demanderesse étaient en cours de traitement ou que son grand-oncle et sa grand-tante avaient, d'un point de vue juridique, le droit d'être ses tuteurs.
[10]
L'agent jugeait non crédible le fait que la demanderesse soit sous la garde de parents éloignés alors qu'elle était toujours mineure, une inférence renforcée par le faible revenu de son grand-oncle et de sa grand-tante. L'agent a relevé l'absence d'autres renseignements financiers, tel qu'un relevé bancaire. L'agent a mentionné que la demanderesse n'avait pas de membres de sa famille proche au Canada pouvant l'aider d'un point de vue financier ou affectif, et que la mère de la demanderesse résidait toujours à Sainte-Lucie.
[11]
Dans son appréciation cumulative des facteurs, l'agent n'était pas convaincu que la demanderesse serait exposée à des difficultés dans l'éventualité où elle devait retourner à Sainte-Lucie. La demanderesse n'a pas de membres de sa famille proche au Canada, et personne au Canada n'en a la garde juridique. L'agent n'était pas convaincu que le grand-oncle et la grand-tante de la demanderesse qui vivent au Canada pourraient, à long terme, subvenir à ses besoins.
Les questions en litige
[12]
La demanderesse soulève les questions suivantes:
1. L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur de fait et de droit en omettant de tenir compte, ou en ne tenant pas dûment compte, des faits pertinents?
2. L'omission du défendeur de s'assurer que la demande de la demanderesse soit examinée par l'agent ayant examiné la demande de sa sœur constitue-t-elle un manquement à l'équité procédurale?
3. Le fait que des décisions opposées ont été rendues à l'égard de demandes présentées par les deux sœurs constitue-t-il un manquement à l'équité procédurale?
4. L'agent a-t-il manqué à l'équité procédurale en omettant de communiquer avec l'agent ayant statué sur la demande de la sœur de la demanderesse?
5. L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur en ne tenant pas suffisamment compte de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant?
6. La demande CH de la demanderesse a-t-elle été rejetée en raison de l'incompétence de son représentant, et ce rejet constitue-t-il une erreur susceptible de contrôle?
[13]
Je reformulerais ainsi les questions en litige:
1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
2. L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur en rejetant la demande?
3. L'agent a-t-il manqué aux principes d'équité procédurale?
Les observations écrites de la demanderesse
[14]
La demanderesse soutient que, vu que sa situation personnelle et ses difficultés étaient essentiellement les mêmes que celles de sa sœur, leur demande CH aurait dû connaitre la même issue.
[15]
La demanderesse soutient que la conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle son grand-oncle et sa grand-tante ne pouvaient, d'un point de vue financier, subvenir à ses besoins était déraisonnable, puisqu'ils le faisaient déjà depuis 2005. En ce qui concerne l'affirmation de l'agent portant qu'il n'y avait pas de documents appuyant l'existence d'une tutelle à son égard, la demanderesse a fourni une déclaration solennelle de sa mère, par laquelle cette dernière donnait la garde exclusive au grand-oncle et à la grand-tante de la demanderesse.
[16]
La demanderesse soutient qu'il est évident que sa mère ne peut subvenir à ses besoins et qu'elle est très attachée à son grand-oncle et à sa grand-tante. Aucune preuve ne démontre que ces derniers ne peuvent subvenir à leurs besoins. L'agent a tiré une conclusion déraisonnable, sans se livrer à une analyse des revenus et des dépenses. La demanderesse devrait vivre avec son grand-oncle et sa grand-tante, étant donné que sa mère ne peut subvenir à ses besoins. Vu que l'agent n'a pas demandé de renseignements supplémentaires concernant les revenus ou les dépenses du grand-oncle et de la grand-tante de la demanderesse, il n'aurait pas dû tirer l'inférence déraisonnable selon laquelle ceux-ci ne pouvaient subvenir aux besoins de la demanderesse.
[17]
Il aurait dû être clair pour l'agent que le grand-oncle et la grand-tante de la demanderesse avaient subvenu à ses besoins pendant une longue période, soit plus de six ans, et que la demanderesse n'avait pas eu de contact avec sa mère au cours de cette période. Renvoyer une personne âgée de 17 ans dans un pays où elle n'a pas de famille chez qui rester et où elle ne dispose d'aucun moyen de subsistance l'exposerait à des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives.
[18]
La sœur de la demanderesse avait, elle aussi, présenté une demande CH. Il ne fait aucun doute, selon les motifs de la décision relative à cette demande, que l'agent ayant rendu cette décision avait reconnu que son grand-oncle et sa grand-tante subvenaient de manière appropriée aux besoins de la sœur de la demanderesse et qu'elle n'aurait pu vivre chez ses parents à Sainte-Lucie. La demanderesse estt venue au Canada à un plus jeune âge que sa sœur, ce qui fait en sorte que sa cause est encore plus solide.
[19]
La demanderesse se fonde sur plusieurs décisions où la Cour a annulé des décisions relatives à des demandes CH en raison de l'omission d'un agent d'examiner correctement l'ensemble de la preuve. La demanderesse soutient que, dans la présente affaire, l'agent a omis de tenir compte de la déclaration solennelle fournie par la mère de la demanderesse et du fait que le grand-oncle et la grand-tante de la demanderesse avaient subvenu à ses besoins pendant sept ans. Cette omission de tenir compte de faits pertinents constituait une erreur de droit susceptible de contrôle.
Les observations écrites du défendeur
[20]
Le défendeur soutient que la demanderesse n'a pas établi que CIC ait été informée, à quelque moment, que les deux sœurs avaient présenté des demandes concomitantes, puisque ce fait n'était mentionné dans aucune des lettres d'accompagnement. Elles n'avaient pas employé le même nom de famille dans leur demande. Aucune des sœurs n'a fait mention de l'autre sœur dans la partie du formulaire de demande réservée aux détails au sujet des membres de la famille. La sœur de la demanderesse avait nommé sa mère adoptive et n'avait pas fait mention de sa mère biologique. CIC n'avait donc aucune raison de joindre les demandes. Par conséquent, il n'y a pas eu violation des droits de la demanderesse en matière d'équité procédurale.
[21]
Le défendeur soutient que la norme de contrôle applicable à l'appréciation d'une demande CH par un agent est la norme de la raisonnabilité, qui appelle à la retenue judiciaire. De telles appréciations sont de nature hautement discrétionnaire, et aucune issue précise, parmi une vaste gamme d'issues possibles, n'est garantie. Les demandes sont examinées individuellement lorsqu'elles ne sont pas jointes. La demanderesse n'a pas avisé son ancien conseil au sujet des allégations d'incompétence qu'elle a formulées à son endroit; la Cour ne peut donc pas se pencher sur cet argument.
[22]
Le défendeur prétend que la décision de l'agent est raisonnable à première vue. L'agent n'était pas saisi de la déclaration solennelle de la mère de la demanderesse, et cette déclaration permettait seulement à la demanderesse de se rendre au Canada avec sa grand-tante et son grand-oncle ainsi que de résider avec eux pendant la période requise pour répondre aux exigences en matière d'adoption. Il n'y avait pas officiellement de garde ou de tutelle.
[23]
L'agent avait des réserves quant à la crédibilité de la déclaration de la demanderesse selon laquelle sa mère l'avait abandonné aux soins de parents éloignés qui étaient à la retraite et qui avaient un faible revenu. L'agent a mis l'accent sur les éléments de la demande qui posaient problème. Personne n'avait la garde légale ou la tutelle légale de la demanderesse au Canada, et le grand-oncle et la grand-tante de cette dernière ont fourni peu de renseignements à propos de leur situation financière. Le défendeur prétend que la demanderesse demande à la Cour de soupeser à nouveau les éléments de preuve, et que ce n'est pas l'objet d'un contrôle judiciaire.
[24]
Bien que la demanderesse prétende qu'il était contraire à la raison de conclure que les membres de la famille ne pouvaient pas subvenir à ses besoins à long terme, le défendeur soutient que la demanderesse avait fourni peu de renseignements sur leur situation financière pour établir qu'ils pouvaient continuer à subvenir à de tels besoins. Il incombait à la demanderesse de fournir tous les éléments de preuve et les renseignements nécessaires. Le fardeau de demander des éléments de preuve supplémentaires n'était pas transféré à l'agent.
[25]
L'agent n'a pas omis de tenir compte de la déclaration solennelle, puisque celle-ci ne faisait pas partie de la demande. Même si cette déclaration avait été versée en preuve, il n'y a pas de mention au sujet de la garde; il n'est question que d'un consentement à ce que la demanderesse se rende chez le grand-oncle et la grand-tante et à ce qu'elle vive avec eux de manière temporaire. L'agent n'a pas eu tort de conclure que la garde n'avait jamais été confiée.
[26]
L'agent a bien apprécié l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, puisque toute son analyse portait sur l'intérêt de la demanderesse. Par conséquent, la demande devrait être rejetée.
Les observations écrites supplémentaires de la demanderesse
[27]
La demanderesse soutient que la conduite de son représentant lui a porté préjudice et que ce préjudice équivalait à une violation de l'équité procédurale. Si l'agent avait su que la mère de la demanderesse avait permis que la sœur de la demanderesse soit adoptée au Canada, la preuve présentée par la demanderesse aurait été plus crédible. Le représentant avait aussi fait preuve d'incompétence en omettant d'informer la demanderesse qu'elle devait soumettre des documents financiers pour étayer sa demande CH. La demanderesse a fourni un avis à son ancien consultant en immigration.
Les observations écrites supplémentaires du défendeur
[28]
Le défendeur prétend que la réponse fournie par l'ancien consultant en immigration de la demanderesse ne corrobore pas la preuve présentée par la demanderesse. Par conséquent, la Cour ne dispose pas d'une assise factuelle suffisante pour conclure que les gestes posés par ce consultant ont entraîné un préjudice pour la demanderesse.
Analyse et décision
[29]
La première question en litige
Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
Lorsque la jurisprudence a défini la norme de contrôle applicable à une question particulière, la cour de révision peut adopter cette norme (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 57).
[30]
Il est bien établi en droit que la norme de contrôle qui s'applique aux questions d'équité procédurale est la décision correcte (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 43). Il n'y a pas lieu de faire preuve de déférence à l'égard du décideur quant à ces questions (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 50).
[31]
Il est bien établi que les conclusions tirées par un agent dans le contexte de demandes de résidence permanente présentées au Canada pour des considérations d'ordre humanitaire sont susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 713, au paragraphe 18;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 1489, au paragraphe 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 868, au paragraphe 13).
[32]
Lors du contrôle de la décision d'un agent selon la norme de la raisonnabilité, la Cour ne doit intervenir que si la Commission est parvenue à une conclusion qui n'est pas transparente, justifiable et intelligible, et qui n'appartient pas aux issues acceptables eu égard à la preuve dont elle disposait (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 59). Comme l'a conclu la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la cour de révision ne peut y substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable, et il ne rentre pas non plus dans les attributions de la cour de révision de soupeser à nouveau les éléments de preuve (au paragraphe 59).
[33]
La deuxième question en litige
L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur en rejetant la demande?
La demanderesse prétend que la décision de l'agent était déraisonnable, car celle-ci ne se penchait pas adéquatement sur la preuve portant que la demanderesse dépend des membres de sa famille depuis 2005 et qu'elle ne pourrait subvenir à ses besoins si elle devait retourner à Sainte-Lucie. En revanche, le défendeur se fonde surtout sur la déférence importante dont il faut faire preuve à l'égard des décisions relatives à des demandes CH pour prétendre que la décision de l'agent était raisonnable. Je vais examiner la décision de l'agent en fonction des critères de la norme de la raisonnabilité: la transparence, la justification et l'intelligibilité ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47). Les décisions relatives aux demandes CH sont de nature discrétionnaire, et il existe donc une vaste gamme d'issues possibles (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 353, au paragraphe 18).
[34]
Le fait que l'agent se soit fondé sur la faiblesse du revenu combiné de la famille pour remettre en question leur capacité à subvenir aux besoins de la demanderesse ne respecte pas le principe de transparence. Il n'y a pas d'indication à savoir pourquoi 24 000 $ est un montant insuffisant ou quel montant serait adéquat, ni de mention d'une preuve relative au coût de la vie à Toronto. Il s'agit d'un raisonnement tout à fait obscur.
[35]
L'agent semble aussi avoir considéré comme un scénario hypothétique le fait que la demanderesse vivait avec les membres de sa famille. Il a mentionné que: [traduction] « [la demanderesse] fréquentait l'école au Canada et que, par conséquent, elle
serait
, d'un point de vue financier, un fardeau beaucoup plus important » (non souligné dans l'original). La dépendance de la demanderesse envers les membres de sa famille n'est pas une hypothèse, puisque, selon la preuve qu'elle a présentée, elle vit bel et bien chez ceux-ci depuis six ans. Cette preuve est manifestement pertinente quant à la question de savoir si les membres de sa famille peuvent subvenir à ses besoins d'un point de vue financier, et l'agent ne donne pas de justification à savoir pourquoi le fait que la demanderesse vit avec les membres de sa famille est analysé comme un changement de situation plutôt que comme le maintien du statu quo.
[36]
L'agent a eu raison de mentionner qu'il n'existait aucune preuve que les membres de la famille de la demanderesse étaient ses tuteurs. Toutefois, cette question n'est pas déterminante dans la présente demande. Selon la preuve présentée par la demanderesse, elle ne sait pas où se trouve sa mère, de sorte qu'elle serait une mineure complètement abandonnée dans l'éventualité où elle devait être renvoyée. Par conséquent, elle prétend que sa situation au Canada ne devrait pas être examinée en termes absolus, mais plutôt relativement aux difficultés auxquelles elle serait exposée si elle devait être renvoyée.
[37]
En réponse à cette allégation de difficultés, l'agent [traduction] « jugeait non crédible » le fait que la demanderesse ait été envoyée au Canada à partir de Sainte-Lucie. Par conséquent, sa demande avait seulement été examinée comme si un renvoi à Sainte-Lucie signifiait qu'elle retournerait sous les soins de sa mère. L'agent n'a offert aucun raisonnement expliquant en quoi la preuve présentée par la demanderesse était invraisemblable.
[38]
La conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle la demanderesse n'avait [traduction] « pas de membres de sa famille proche au Canada » n'est pas intelligible, tout comme le fait qu'il mentionne à plusieurs reprises que le grand-oncle et la grand-tante de la demanderesse sont des parents éloignés. L'agent n'a pas établi ce qui constituerait un lien de parenté suffisamment rapproché, ni la raison pour laquelle ces membres de la famille de la demanderesse, qui avaient vécu avec elle et avaient subvenu à ses besoins pendant six ans, ne répondaient pas à ce critère.
[39]
La preuve ne dicte aucune issue précise, et ce, pour chacune de ces conclusions; il s'agit de la raison pour laquelle il revient à l'agent d'examiner la preuve et de tirer des conclusions. Même en faisant preuve de la déférence qui s'impose envers l'agent, les motifs en l'espèce n'expliquent simplement pas pourquoi l'agent en est venu à ces conclusions.
[40]
Il n'appartient pas à la Cour de soupeser à nouveau la preuve dans la présente demande. La Cour a cependant pour rôle d'apprécier la transparence, l'intelligibilité et la justification de la décision. Dans la présente affaire, la capacité des membres de la famille de la demanderesse à subvenir à ses besoins ainsi que la question d'établir si la demanderesse serait sous les soins de sa mère dans l'éventualité où elle devait retourner à Sainte-Lucie étaient les deux questions factuelles au cœur de sa demande. L'agent n'a fourni qu'une simple conclusion et une explication inadéquate, et ce, à l'égard de ces deux questions. Même en examinant la décision dans son intégralité, et sans isoler chacune de ces deux questions, la décision ne répond pas au critère de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[41]
Par conséquent, je conclus que la décision de l'agent était déraisonnable.
[42]
Je n'ai pas à traiter de la troisième question en litige, compte tenu de ma conclusion quant à la deuxième question.
[43]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire sera accueillie et l'affaire sera renvoyée à un autre agent pour nouvelle décision.
[44]
Aucune partie n'a souhaité proposer une question grave de portée générale pour examen en vue de la certification.
JUGEMENT
[45]
LA COUR STATUE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie, que la décision de l'agent est annulée et que l'affaire est renvoyée à un autre agent pour nouvelle décision.

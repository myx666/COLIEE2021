INTRODUCTION
[1]
Shore, J.
[Translation]: In Bazargan, it was determined that personal and knowing participation can be direct or indirect and membership in an organization that is engaged in the condemned activities is not required. It is not working within an organization that makes someone an accomplice to the organization's activities, but knowingly contributing to those activities in any way or making them possible, whether from within or outside the organization.
These principles have been reiterated and confirmed in subsequent jurisprudence of the Federal Court of Appeal, most recently  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1649 (QL))
NATURE OF THE JUDICIAL PROCEEDING
[2]
This is an application for judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (Act) of the decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) dated June 14, 2005, that the applicant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
FACTS
[3]
The applicant, Bonifacio Aceve Acevedo, was the principal applicant before the Refugee Protection Division. His son, Wiliam Jose Acevedo Beza, and his daughter-in-law, Ana Ruth Maldonado Martinez, who were also contemplated by the Board’s decision, filed a separate application in docket bearing number IMM-4301-05, of this Court’s Registry. The claims of his son and daughter-in-law were based on Mr. Aceve Acevedo’s claim.
[4]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo, his son and his daughter-in-law are all citizens of Guatemala.
[5]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo alleged that his problems stemmed from the fact that he served in the Guatemalan army for 14 years.
[6]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo was excluded from the benefit of the Geneva Convention (Convention) by virtue of paragraph 1F(a) because he was guilty by association of crimes against humanity, committed as a voluntary collaborator of the Guatemalan army, from 1983 to 1997, as Military Commissioner in the Chiquimula region. Eight massacres were perpetrated by the army in that region.
[7]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo received a first death threat on August 22, 2000, when a group wearing hoods yelled at him, in front of his house, to leave his home. Three years later, on December 5, 2003, gunshots were fired at his house by armed persons wearing hoods, whom he was unable to identify.
[8]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo did not alert the local authorities because the attackers had threatened to kill all of his family.
[9]
Antonio Guerre, mayor of the city of Concepcion las Minas, in the district of Chiquimula, in Quetzaltepeque, provided him with a car and a driver, enabling him to flee to Mexico with his son and his daughter-in-law, where they headed for Canada.
IMPUGNED DECISION
[10]
The Board determined that Mr. Aceve Acevedo, whose testimony was evasive, unpersuasive and not credible, had not established a connection between his fear and any of the grounds of the Convention.
[11]
His testimony regarding the identity of his attackers and their motives for threatening him was vague and hardly conclusive. The Board determined that personal vendettas are not included in the grounds of persecution provided in the Convention.
[12]
The Board determined that Mr. Aceve Acevedo, his son and his daughter-in-law, who had indeed not requested protection from the authorities, could live elsewhere in the country where members of their family were already settled. It observed that it had not been established that the other members of the family were in danger in Guatemala.
ISSUES
[13]
Is the Board’s decision reasonable?
ANALYSIS
Legislative background
[14]
Section 96 of the Act provides for the requirements necessary to qualify as a refugee:
96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(a) is outside each of their country of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
96. La qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention – le réfugié – la personne qui, craignant avec raison d’être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:
a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
b) soit, si elle n’a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.
[15]
Subsection 97(1) of the Act deals with persons in need of protection:
97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable, or because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
97. (1) La qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n’a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:
a) soit au risque, s’il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d’être soumise à la torture au sens de l’article premier de la Convention contre la torture;
b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:
(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,
(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d’autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s’y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,
(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes – sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales – et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés pas elles,
(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l’incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.
[16]
Section 98 of the Act implements section F of the Convention:
98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.
F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:
(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;
(b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;
(c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
98. La personne visée aux sections E ou F de l’article premier de la Convention sur les réfugiés ne peut avoir la qualité de réfugié ni de personne à protéger.
F. Les dispositions de cette Convention ne seront pas applicables aux personnes dont on aura des raisons sérieuses de penser:
a) Qu’elles ont commis un crime contre la paix, un crime de guerre ou un crime contre l’humanité, au sens des instruments internationaux élaborés pour prévoir des dispositions relatives à ces crimes;
b) Qu’elles ont commis un crime grave de droit commun en dehors du pays d’accueil avant d’y être admises comme réfugiés;
c) Qu’elles se sont rendues coupables d’agissements contraires aux buts et aux principes des Nations Unies.
The standard of review
[17]
The purely factual issues decided by the Board in arriving at the impugned decision are reviewable in accordance with the standard of patent unreasonableness. The Board’s decision of mixed facts and law, determining that the applicant falls under paragraph 1F(a) of the Convention, cannot be set aside unless it is unreasonable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 108 (QL), at paragraph 14).
[18]
With regard to State protection, it is the standard of patent unreasonableness that applies (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 98 (QL), at paragraph 9).
The exclusion
[19]
The standard of proof of “serious reasons for considering” provided under paragraph 1F(a) of the Convention, is indeed inferior to the standard required in a criminal context “beyond a reasonable doubt” or in civil law “on a balance of probabilities” or “preponderance of evidence” ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 16;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[20]
The Board carefully reviewed the principles applicable in matters of complicity and complicity by association, as well as the nature of the organization in order to determine whether it was directed to a limited, brutal purpose, relying on the case law.
[21]
With regard to the degree of involvement required, a person can be held responsible for a crime without having committed it personally, i.e. as an accomplice. In  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 9, the Court stated:
... complicity through association. In other words, individuals may be rendered responsible for the acts of others because of their close association with the principal actors.
[22]
The essential element for complicity is the claimant’s personal and knowing involvement. That is the necessary mens rea ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 14;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 13).
[23]
In  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 27-28, Carolyn Layden-Stevenson J. referred to the principles applicable to matters of complicity:
Accomplices as well as principal actors may be found to have committed international crimes (although, for present purposes, I am not concerned with principal actors). The court accepted the notion of complicity defined as a personal and knowing participation  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and complicity through association whereby individuals may be rendered responsible for the acts of others because of their close association with the principal actors  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Complicity rests on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties may have of it: Ramirez; Moreno.
Madam Justice Reed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) synthesized the trilogy principles at pages 84 and 85:
The Ramirez, Moreno, and Sivakumar cases all deal with the degree or type of participation which will constitute complicity. Those cases have established that mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offences is not normally sufficient to bring one into the category of an accomplice. At the same time, if the organization is principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose, such as a secret police activity, mere membership may indeed meet the requirements of personal and knowing participation. The cases also establish that mere presence at the scene of an offence, for example, as a bystander with no intrinsic connection with the persecuting group will not amount to personal involvement. Physical presence together with other factors may however qualify as a personal and knowing participation.
As I understand the jurisprudence, it is that a person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them from occurring (if he has the power to do so) nor disengages himself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with safety for himself) but who lends his active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist. I note that the situation envisaged by this jurisprudence is not one in which isolated incidents of international offences have occurred but where the Board of such offences is a continuous and regular part of the operation.
[24]
When it is a matter of a claimant’s complicity by association, the crimes alleged against the organizations with which the claimant is supposed to have associated lead to his exclusion (Harb, supra, at paragraph 11).
[25]
In Harb, supra, at paragraph 18, the Federal Court of Appeal quoted with approval the following passage from  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 11, where it is clearly recognized that personal and knowing participation does not require formal membership in the group and may be from within or outside an organization:
In our view, it goes without saying that "personal and knowing participation" can be direct or indirect and does not require formal membership in the organization that is ultimately engaged in the condemned activities. It is not working within an organization that makes someone an accomplice to the organization's activities, but knowingly contributing to those activities in any way or making them possible, whether from within or from outside the organization. At p. 318, MacGuigan J.A. said that "[a] t bottom, complicity rests . . . on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have of it". Those who become involved in an operation that is not theirs, but that they know will probably lead to the Board of an international offence, lay themselves open to the application of the exclusion clause in the same way as those who play a direct part in the operation.
[26]
In  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 29-30, Layden-Stevenson J. also pointed out that membership with the association engaged in the condemned activities is not required:
In Bazargan, it was determined that personal and knowing participation can be direct or indirect and membership in an organization that is engaged in the condemned activities is not required. It is not working within an organization that makes someone an accomplice to the organization's activities, but knowingly contributing to those activities in any way or making them possible, whether from within or outside the organization.
These principles have been reiterated and confirmed in subsequent jurisprudence of the Federal Court of Appeal, most recently  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and Harb.
[27]
In order to be granted refugee status, the claimant must, as soon as possible, have disassociated himself from the organization committing the crimes, taking into account his safety ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 8-9).
[28]
The Board’s determination that Mr. Aceve Acevedo was excluded by the application of paragraph 1F(a) of the Convention is reasonable considering the evidence and the applicable principles of law.
[29]
It is conceivable that the reference at page 9 of the reasons of the Board’s decision – that Mr. Aceve Acevedo was also excluded pursuant to paragraph 1F(c) of the Convention – is clearly a typographical error. In fact, the Board’s reasons do not address this issue. Moreover, the disposition does not refer to it, either.
[30]
The Board made the following findings of fact regarding the role played by Mr. Aceve Acevedo and the military commissioners.
[31]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo served in the Guatemalan land forces from 1983 to 1997, in the Regiment of Zone 8 in Chiquimula, under the command of Commandant Juan Martinez, as a Military Commissioner.
[32]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo stated that he had voluntarily collaborated as a military commissioner in the army’s activities in the area where he lived, the municipality of Concepcion las Minas, district of Chiquimula.
[33]
His army card authorized him to carry a firearm as a military commissioner and a member of the Guatemala Armed Forces.
[34]
A certificate of patriotism, an award of merit, was awarded to Mr. Aceve Acevedo by the Chief of National Defence and the Minister of National Defence on September 15, 1995, for services rendered.
[35]
While in some villages the people managed to trick the army by simulating surveillance activities, so that they would not have to collaborate openly with the army and make reports against their will, Mr. Aceve Acevedo never indicated that he tried to evade his responsibilities.
[36]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo volunteered as a military commissioner for 14 years without disassociating himself from it and did not quit the organization until 1997, when it was abolished by the government in power.
[37]
The Board examined the documentary evidence which established, inter alia: the role of military commissioners in the organization of civilian patrols and the supervision of their activities; a simple accusation by a military commissioner was often enough for an accused to be killed; that the network of military informants was considerable and that the informants, also called the “ears” of the army, were authorized to carry weapons, to gather information about peoples’ comings and goings and to transmit the information to the army’s secret services; that this counter-insurgency policing often took the form of State-tolerated terrorism, with systematic and massive destruction, particularly of indigenous communities and peasant groups.
[38]
The evidence also establishes that the impunity influenced the conduct of the army, the police, and the military commissioners, while promoting violence against the people; that the military commissioners were ranked fourth in the military hierarchy; that the strategic objectives of the army, in its attempt to militarize the country in the1980s, contemplated an almost absolute assumption of power with the creation of a parallel monitoring system, semi-transparent and very powerful; that the intelligence services played a key role in this militarization effort which resulted in the violation of human rights; that the intelligence services exercised control based not only on their own framework but also on a network of informants.
[39]
Finally, the documentary evidence establishes that there were eight massacres in the Chiquimula region; that military commissioners subject to the army’s discipline were civilian army agents in all of Guatemala’s hamlets, local representatives serving as intermediaries between the army and the local community; that the organization of civilian patrols were often the responsibility of military commissioners and that they answered to the army’s orders, contrary to Mr. Aceve Acevedo’s statements; that even the most remote hamlets were not spared; and that in 1995, the government put an end to civilian patrols and military commissioners in the Chiquimula region.
[40]
The Board made many negative credibility findings regarding Mr. Aceve Acevedo.
[41]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo’s testimony at the hearing was vague, ambiguous and evasive. He repeated the same explanations while avoiding answering questions directly. He simply stated that he had simply ensured that everything went well and was in order in the village. He also said that there had not been any massacres, torture or abuse in his region.
[42]
It is very unlikely, contrary to Mr. Aceve Acevedo’s allegations, that nothing happened in his region where he did no more than ensure that everything was in order, considering the documentary evidence which fully describes the crimes committed by the army and the many massacres in rural and urban areas alike.
[43]
It is implausible that the region where he lived was entirely without means of communication. The Board did not believe that Mr. Aceve Acevedo could use his illiteracy to justify his ignorance of the facts.
[44]
His changing testimony, including with regard to the Commissioners meetings and his refusal to provide more information regarding his role undermined his credibility. His obscure testimony regarding his general knowledge of the civil war events and the activities in his own region only further undermined his credibility.
[45]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo’s statements that there were not any indigenous Mayan groups in his region and that there were no massacres are not supported by the documentary evidence which places between 20 and 50 % of the indigenous population in this region and establishes that about 0.5% of the massacres in the country were perpetrated in Chiquimula, Military Zone 8 (massacres and disappearances were estimated to exceed 200,000).
[46]
He was visibly uncomfortable with the questions he was asked regarding the massacres of civilians with the help of the collaborators and informants, the military commissioners and the Civilian Self-defence Patrol (PAC). The Board noted that he was aware of the massacres perpetrated by the army.
[47]
For a finding of patent unreasonableness, it is not enough that a finding is erroneous in the eyes of the Court, the finding must further be clearly irrational, contrary to reason or common sense ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2000] S.C.R. No. 23 (QL), at paragraph 2;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). A finding of fact is patently unreasonable only where the evidence, viewed reasonably, is incapable of supporting the tribunal’s findings (Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 301 v. Montreal (City), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 793, [1997] S.C.R. No. 39 (QL), at paragraph 53).
[48]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo did not establish that these conditions for intervention were met in this case. The Board’s decision is comprehensive and it has not been established that the findings are not based on the evidence.
[49]
After reviewing all of the evidence, the Board determined that: Mr. Aceve Acevedo was aware that his collaboration with the army could have serious consequences on the people that he reported; considering that the documentary evidence established that the armed forces of Guatemala had been convicted of crimes against humanity, Mr. Aceve Acevedo was guilty by association, and was excluded from the protection of the Convention under paragraph 1F(a); there was no doubt that Mr. Aceve Acevedo had collaborated as a military commissioner; as a voluntary collaborator of the Guatemalan army for 14 years, Mr. Aceve Acevedo could not have been unaware of what was going on, accordingly he was complicit in the responsibility for such massacres, and the award of merit awarded for his loyal military service in that regard supported that finding.
[50]
The Board also determined that: Mr. Aceve Acevedo could not claim that nothing was going on in his region, given an Amnesty International article regarding the famous trial of a military commissioner from that region, accused of crimes against the residents of the region; Mr. Aceve Acevedo had voluntarily assisted paramilitary groups directed to a limited, brutal purpose, just like those of the army, which controlled them in a network that extended across the entire country; by collaborating and participating in the army’s activities, Mr. Aceve Acevedo became an accomplice in the same crimes against civilian populations; of his own admission, Mr. Aceve Acevedo agreed with the obligations imposed on him by the military authorities as a military commissioner and he was aware of the role he played in reporting what was going on in his area to his Chief; it was reasonable to determine that Mr. Aceve Acevedo had to have known the consequences of his reports and, accordingly, the army’s reprisals and that his role as informant gave him a serious responsibility; it was therefore reasonable to believe that Mr. Aceve had to have known that the activities of the paramilitary organization to which he belonged would likely lead to the commission of crimes against humanity.
[51]
The Board was entitled to rely on the documentary evidence to assess the role of the military commissioners, their collaboration with the army and the significance of the massacres which occurred across the country, including in Mr. Aceve Acevedo’s region.
[52]
In the specific case of Mr. Aceve Acevedo, the Board was entitled to presume that he was personally and knowingly involved based on the fact that he had been a military commissioner and collaborator of the army which committed crimes against humanity.
[53]
Considering the evidence and the applicable law, it was reasonable for the panel to determine that Mr. Aceve Acevedo was guilty, by association, of crimes against humanity committed by the army and was excluded from the protection of the Convention under paragraph 1F(a) of the Convention.
Inclusion
[54]
The Board determined that Mr. Aceve Acevedo collaborated with the Guatemalan army and that he had attempted to conceal the role that he played as a military collaborator and that his testimony, on that point, was obscure regarding his general knowledge of the events of the civil war and the activities in his own region.
[55]
The Board pointed out that at the end of the war the military authorities had given him an award of merit to acknowledge his loyal services. It also noted that even though the government had put an end to civilian patrols and to the duties of military commissioners, Mr. Aceve Acevedo did not leave the organization until 1997, when it was abolished by the government in power.
[56]
The Board determined that Mr. Aceve Acevedo’s answers regarding the identities of the attackers and the reasons for their threats were vague and inconclusive. This shortcoming in Mr. Aceve Acevedo’s testimony supports the Board’s finding that, absent clear and relevant explanations, it could not believe the allegations of persecution.
[57]
Considering his lack of credibility with regard to his allegations of persecution, the Board determined that he had not established a connection with the Convention, and that he feared possible vengeance by the victims of acts that he had committed as military commissioner.
[58]
This finding is not patently unreasonable. The objective assessment of evidence falls within the Board’s mandate ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 5). The Board must appreciate the plausibility of claimants’ testimony and make inferences from it. The inferences must be upheld so long as they are not so unreasonable as to warrant the Court’s intervention ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[59]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 960 (QL), at paragraph 25, Mr. Justice Edmond Blanchard pointed out that fear of reprisals motivated by vengeance and being a victim of a criminal act are not equivalent to a ground of persecution under section 96.
[60]
Assessing the risk of persecution is a question of fact which calls for a high level of judicial deference ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).
[61]
The person asking for refugee status must establish the subjective and objective elements required to satisfy the definition of Convention refugee ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 539 (QL), at paragraph 22).
State protection
[62]
At paragraph 9 of the declaration contained in his Personal Information Form, Mr. Aceve Acevedo stated:
[translation]
We did not alert the police, because they made us be quiet, because they told us that if we alerted the police they would kill the entire family.
[63]
Indeed, it is important to note that the Board did not find Mr. Aceve Acevedo’s allegations of persecution credible.
[64]
Moreover, the fact that Mr. Aceve Acevedo had asked for and obtained help from his friend, the mayor of Concepcion las Minas, to leave the country, does not qualify as the request for protection required of him. Of his own admission, as stated earlier, he did not request protection from the police.
[65]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo submits that the Board disregarded exhibits P-5 and P-6, namely two letters that state that his wife received an anonymous letter informing her that they were looking for her husband and that, afraid, she had requested help from Rigoberto Espinosa, who put her up at his house, with all of his family, in another village.
[66]
The presumption that the Board reviewed all of the evidence must prevail in this case. Further, exhibits P-5 and P-6 have no effect on the Board’s determination regarding the State’s protection. They do not indicate that Mr. Aceve Acevedo’s family requested protection from the authorities.
[67]
It is suggested that in determining that Mr. Aceve Acevedo had not indicated that the other members of his family were in danger in his country, the Board considered exhibits P-5 and P-6, which are inconclusive with regard to the family members’ safety.
[68]
The issue of protection from his own country, of which the claimant must avail himself before claiming protection from another country, is an integral part of the definition of Convention refugee ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1020 (QL), at paragraph 12).
[69]
The more democratic institutions there are in a claimant’s country, the more the claimant must exhaust the recourse offered in that country before requesting the protection of another country ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 5).
[70]
The Board’s finding regarding State protection is therefore well founded.
Section 97
[71]
Mr. Aceve Acevedo contends that the Board erred in expunging the notion of risk to life provided under subsection 97(1) of the Act.
[72]
A distinct analysis under subsection 97(1) of the Act is not always required and was not in this case.
[73]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 2013 (QL), at paragraph 22, Mr. Justice Richard Mosley stated as follows:
This Court seems to have come to a consensus that a separate section 97 analysis is not required if there is no evidence that could go to establishing that the person is in need of protection:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[74]
In this case, the Board determined that Mr. Aceve Acevedo’s answers were inconclusive with regard to the identities of the attackers, that he lacked credibility with regard to his allegations of persecution and that he had not sought protection from the authorities.
[75]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Martineau stated that based on the applicant’s lack of credibility and the other reasons stated in the decision, the Board was entitled to determine that the applicant was not a person in need of protection:
[translation]
In this regard, the Board could reasonably determine that there were no substantial grounds suggesting that the applicant would be subjected personally to a danger of torture by relying on the applicant’s lack of credibility and on the other grounds stated in the decision. The applicant has not persuaded me that in doing so the Board disregarded the documentary evidence which in itself was not conclusive and did not support a finding that the applicant would be a person contemplated by paragraph 97(1)(a) of the Act.
[76]
The finding on State protection, examined earlier, is also determinative with regard to the assessment of the claim based on section 97. This section provides for recognizing the status of persons in need of protection in cases where there is a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment. Inter alia, the claimant must be unable or unwilling to avail himself of protection from his country.
[77]
Therefore, the Board’s failure to carry out a distinct analysis pursuant to section 97 in this case is not determinative considering its other findings, which themselves are determinative.
[78]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1604 (QL), at paragraph 13, Judith Snider J. also determined, on this point:
It would have been preferable for the Board to have stated clearly that there was no persuasive evidence before it that related to s. 97 grounds. However, its failure to do so in this case is not, in my view, an error. However, even if the Board erred, I would conclude that any error was immaterial ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.) (QL)).
CONCLUSION
[79]
The Board’s decision is not patently unreasonable. Therefore, since there is nothing to warrant this Court’s intervention, this application for judicial review is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[80]
THE COURT orders that
1. The application be dismissed;
2. No serious question of general importance be certified.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Bazargan, il a été tranché que la participation personnelle et consciente peut être directe ou indirecte et qu'elle ne requière pas l'appartenance à une organisation qui s'adonne à des activités condamnées. Ce n'est pas le f ait de travailler dans une organisation qui rend une personne complice des activités de l'organisation, mais le fait de contribuer consciemment à ces activités de quelque façon ou de les rendre possibles, que ce soit de l'intérieur ou de l'extérieur de l'organisation.
Ces principes ont été réitérés et confirmés dans des arrêts subséquents de la Cour d'appel fédérale et plus récemment dans  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] A.C.F. no 1649 (QL))

Le demandeur, monsieur Bonifacio Aceve Acevedo, était le demandeur principal devant la Section de la protection des réfugiés. Son fils, monsieur Wiliam Jose Acevedo Beza, et sa belle-fille, madame Ana Ruth Maldonado Martinez, également visés par la décision de la Commission, ont présenté une demande distincte dans le dossier portant le numéro IMM-4301-05 du greffe de cette Cour. Son fils et sa belle-fille ont fondé leurs revendications sur celle de monsieur Aceve Acevedo.
[4]
Monsieur Aceve Acevedo, son fils et sa belle-fille sont tous citoyens du Guatemala.
[5]
Monsieur Aceve Acevedo allègue que ses problèmes sont dus au fait qu'il a servi pendant quatorze ans dans l'armée guatémaltèque.
[6]
Monsieur Aceve Acevedo a été exclu du bénéfice de la Convention de Genève (Convention) aux termes de la section 1Fa) parce qu'il s'était rendu coupable par association de crimes contre l'humanité commis en tant que collaborateur volontaire de l'armée guatémaltèque, de 1983 à 1997, comme Commissaire militaire dans la région de Chiquimula. Huit massacres ont été perpétrés par l'armée dans cette région.
[7]
Ce dernier a reçu une première menace de mort le 22 août 2000 lorsqu'un groupe portant cagoule lui aurait crié, devant chez lui, de quitter sa maison. Trois ans plus tard, le 5 décembre 2003, des coups de feu ont été tirés sur sa maison par des personnes armées portant cagoule et qu'il n'a pu identifier.
[8]
Monsieur Aceve Acevedo n'a pas avisé les autorités locales car les agresseurs l'avaient menacé de tuer toute sa famille.
[9]
Monsieur Antonio Guerre, maire de la ville de Concepcion las Minas, dans le district de Chiquimula, à Quetzaltepeque, lui a fourni une voiture et un chauffeur, ce qui lui a permis de fuir au Mexique, avec son fils et sa belle-fille, d'où ils se sont dirigés vers le Canada.
DÉCISION CONTESTÉE
[10]
La Commission a conclu que monsieur Aceve Acevedo, don't le témoignage était évasif, non convaincant et non crédible, n'avait pas établi de lien entre sa crainte et l'un des motifs de la Convention.
[11]
Son témoignage, quant à l'identité de ses agresseurs et aux motifs de leurs menaces, était vague et peu concluant. La Commission a conclu que les vengeances personnelles ne sont pas incluses dans les motifs de persécution prévus à la Convention.
[12]
La Commission a conclu que M. Aceve Acevedo, son fils et sa belle-fille qui n'ont par ailleurs pas demandé la protection des autorités, pourraient vivre ailleurs dans le pays où des membres de leur famille se sont déjà établis. Elle a constaté qu'il n'avait pas été établi que les autres membres de la famille étaient en danger au Guatemala.
QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[13]
La décision de la Commission est-elle raisonnable?
ANALYSE
Le cadre législatif
[14]
L'article 96 de la Loi porte sur les critères nécessaires afin d'être reconnu comme étant réfugié:
96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:
a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays don't elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;
b) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.
96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(a) is outside each of their country of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
[15]
Le paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi porte sur les personnes à protéger:
97. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays don't elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:
a) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;
b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:
(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,
(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,
(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés pas elles,
(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.
97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable, or because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
[16]
L'article 98 de la Loi met en oeuvre la section F de la Convention:
98. La personne visée aux sections E ou F de l'article premier de la Convention sur les réfugiés ne peut avoir la qualité de réfugié ni de personne à protéger.
F. Les dispositions de cette Convention ne seront pas applicables aux personnes don't on aura des raisons sérieuses de penser:
a) Qu'elles ont commis un crime contre la paix, un crime de guerre ou un crime contre l'humanité, au sens des instruments internationaux élaborés pour prévoir des dispositions relatives à ces crimes;
b) Qu'elles ont commis un crime grave de droit commun en dehors du pays d'accueil avant d'y être admises comme réfugiés;
c) Qu'elles se sont rendues coupables d'agissements contraires aux buts et aux principes des Nations Unies.
98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.
F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:
(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;
(b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;
(c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
La norme de contrôle
[17]
Les questions purement factuelles décidées par la Commission pour parvenir à la décision attaquée sont contrôlables selon la norme de la décision manifestement déraisonnable. La décision mixte de faits et de droit de la Commission, selon laquelle le demandeur est visé par l'alinéa 1Fa) de la Convention, ne peut être annulée que si elle est déraisonnable. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] A.C.F. no 108 (QL), au paragraphe 14)
[18]
En matière de protection de l'État, c'est la norme du caractère manifestement déraisonnable qui s'applique. (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] A.C.F. no 98 (QL), au paragraphe 9)
L'exclusion
[19]
La norme de preuve des « raisons sérieuses de penser » prévue à l'alinéa 1Fa) de la Convention est bien inférieure à celle requise dans le cadre du droit criminel « hors de tout doute raisonnable » ou de droit civil « selon la prépondérance des probabilités » ou « prépondérance de preuve » . ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 16;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
[20]
La Commission a attentivement examiné les principes applicables en matière de complicité et de complicité par association, ainsi que la nature de l'organisation afin de déterminer si celle-ci vise des fins limitées et brutales, s'appuyant sur plusieurs arrêts.
[21]
Relativement au degré de participation requis, une personne peut être tenue responsable d'un crime sans l'avoir commis personnellement, à savoir à titre de complice. Dans l'arrêt Sivakumar, ci-dessus, au paragraphe 9, la Cour a mentionné :
... la complicité par association, laquelle s'entend du fait qu'un individu peut être tenu responsable d'actes commis par d'autres, et ce en raison de son association étroite avec les auteurs principaux.
[22]
L'élément essentiel pour qu'il y ait complicité est la participation personnelle et consciente du revendicateur. Il s'agit là de la mens rea nécessaire. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 14; Sivakumar, ci-dessus, au paragraphe 13)
[23]
Dans Zazai, ci-dessus, aux paragraphes 27-28, le juge Carolyn Layden-Stevenson a rappelé les principes applicables en matière de complicité:
Des complices, de même que des auteurs principaux, peuvent être considérés comme ayant commis des crimes internationaux (quoique, aux fins des présentes, je ne suis pas préoccupée par les auteurs principaux). La Cour, dans Ramirez, a reconnu le concept de complicité défini comme une participation personnelle et consciente et, dans Sivakumar, le concept de complicité par association par lequel des individus peuvent être tenus responsables d'actes commis par d'autres en raison de leur association étroite avec les auteurs principaux. La complicité dépend de l'existence d'une intention commune et de la connaissance que toutes les parties en cause peuvent en avoir: voir Ramirez et Moreno.
Mme la juge Reed dans la décision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1re inst.), a résumé comme suit, aux pages 84 et 85, les principes établis dans la trilogie:
Dans les décisions Ramirez, Moreno et Sivakumar, il est question du degré ou du type de participation qui constitue la complicité. Il ressort de ces décisions que la simple adhésion à une organisation qui commet sporadiquement des infractions internationales n'implique pas normalement la complicité. Par contre, lorsque l'organisation vise principalement des fins limitées et brutales, comme celles d'une police secrète, ses membres peuvent être considérés comme y participant personnellement et sciemment. Il découle également de cette jurisprudence que la simple présence d'une personne sur les lieux d'une infraction en tant que spectatrice par exemple, sans lien avec le groupe persécuteur, ne fait pas d'elle une complice. Mais sa présence, alliée à d'autres facteurs, peut impliquer sa participation personnelle et consciente.
Selon mon interprétation de la jurisprudence, sera considéré comme complice quiconque fait partie du groupe persécuteur, qui a connaissance des actes accomplis par ce groupe, et qui ne prend pas de mesures pour les empêcher (s'il peut le faire) ni ne se dissocie du groupe à la première occasion (compte tenu [page96] de sa propre sécurité), mais qui l'appuie activement. On voit là une intention commune. Je fais remarquer que la jurisprudence susmentionnée ne vise pas des infractions internationales isolées, mais la situation où la perpétration de ces infractions fait continûment et régulièrement partie de l'opération.
[24]
Lorsqu'il s'agit de la complicité d'un revendicateur par association, c'est la nature des crimes reprochés à l'organisation à laquelle on lui reproche de s'être associé qui mène à son exclusion. (Harb, ci-dessus, au paragraphe 11)
[25]
Dans l'arrêt Harb, ci-dessus, au paragraphe 18, la Cour d'appel fédérale a cité avec approbation le passage suivant de l'arrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 11, où il est clairement reconnu que la participation personnelle et consciente ne requiert pas l'appartenance formelle au groupe et peut se faire à l'intérieur ou à l'extérieur d'une organisation:
Il va de soi, nous semble-t-il, qu'une « participation personnelle et consciente » puisse être directe ou indirecte et qu'elle ne requière pas l'appartenance formelle au groupe qui, en dernier ressort, s'adonne aux activités condamnées. Ce n'est pas tant le fait d'oeuvrer au sein d'un groupe qui rend quelqu'un complice des activités du groupe, que le fait de contribuer, de près ou de loin, de l'intérieur ou de l'extérieur, en toute connaissance de cause, aux dites activités ou de les rendre possibles. Il n'est nul besoin d'être un membre pour être un collaborateur. La complicité, nous disait le juge MacGuigan à la page 318, « dépend essentiellement de l'existence d'une intention commune et de la connaissance que toutes les parties en cause en ont » . Celui qui met sa propre roue dans l'engrenage d'une opération qui n'est pas la sienne mais don't il sait qu'elle mènera vraisemblablement à la commission d'un crime international, s'expose à l'application de la clause d'exclusion au même titre que celui qui participe directement à l'opération.
[26]
Dans Zazai, ci-dessus, aux paragraphes 29-30, le juge Layden-Stevenson a également souligné que l'appartenance à l'association qui s'adonne aux activités condamnées n'est pas requise:
Dans Bazargan, il a été tranché que la participation personnelle et consciente peut être directe ou indirecte et qu'elle ne requière pas l'appartenance à une organisation qui s'adonne à des activités condamnées. Ce n'est pas le f ait de travailler dans une organisation qui rend une personne complice des activités de l'organisation, mais le fait de contribuer consciemment à ces activités de quelque façon ou de les rendre possibles, que ce soit de l'intérieur ou de l'extérieur de l'organisation.
Ces principes ont été réitérés et confirmés dans des arrêts subséquents de la Cour d'appel fédérale et plus récemment dans Sumaida et Harb.
[27]
Pour pouvoir obtenir le statut de réfugié, le revendicateur doit, dès que possible, s'être dissocié de l'organisation qui commet les crimes, compte tenu de sa sécurité. (Sivakumar, ci-dessus; Moreno, ci-dessus;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), aux paragraphes 8-9)
[28]
La conclusion de la Commission, que monsieur Aceve Acevedo est exclu par l'application de l'alinéa 1Fa) de la Convention, est raisonnable compte tenu de la preuve et des principes de droit applicables.
[29]
Il est permis de croire que la mention, à la page 9 des motifs de la décision de la Commission, que monsieur Aceve Acevedo était également exclu en vertu de la section 1Fc) de la Convention est manifestement une coquille. En effet, les motifs de la Commission ne traitent pas de cet aspect. De surcroît, le dispositif n'en fait pas état non plus.
[30]
La Commission a tiré les conclusions de fait suivantes quant au rôle joué par monsieur Aceve Acevedo et les Commissaires militaires.
[31]
Monsieur Aceve Acevedo a servi dans l'armée de terre du Guatemala de 1983 à 1997, dans le Régiment de la zone 8 à Chiquimula, sous les ordres du commandant Juan Martinez, comme Commissaire militaire.
[32]
Monsieur Aceve Acevedo a déclaré avoir collaboré volontairement aux activités de l'armée dans le secteur où il habitait, la municipalité de Concepcion las Minas, district de Chiquimula, comme Commissaire militaire.
[33]
Sa carte militaire l'autorisait à porter une arme à feu en tant que Commissaire militaire et membre des Forces armées du Guatemala.
[34]
Une attestation de mérite à la patrie, diplôme d'honneur, a été décerné à monsieur Aceve Acevedo par le Chef de l'État major de la Défense nationale et le ministre de la Défense nationale, le 15 septembre 1995, pour services rendus.
[35]
Alors que dans certains villages les gens réussissaient à tromper l'armée en simulant des activités de surveillance, pour ne pas avoir à collaborer ouvertement avec l'armée et faire des dénonciations contre leur gré, monsieur Aceve Acevedo n'a jamais indiqué qu'il avait cherché à esquiver ses responsabilités.
[36]
Monsieur Aceve Acevedo a travaillé volontairement comme Commissaire militaire pendant quatorze années sans s'en dissocier et n'a quitté l'organisation qu'en 1997 parce qu'elle a été abolie par le gouvernement en place.
[37]
La Commission a examiné la preuve documentaire qui établit, notamment : quel était le rôle des Commissaires militaires dans l'organisation des patrouilles civiles et de la supervision de leurs activités; qu'il suffisait souvent d'une simple accusation d'un Commissaire militaire pour qu'un accusé soit tué; que le réseau des informateurs militaires était considérable et que les informateurs, aussi appelés les « oreilles » de l'armée, étaient autorisés à porter des armes, à collecter l'information concernant les allées et venues des personnes et à la transmettre aux Services secrets de l'armée; que cette police de contre insurrection prenait souvent la forme de terrorisme soutenu par l'État, comportant la destruction systématique et massive, particulièrement de communautés indigènes et de groupes de paysans.
[38]
La preuve démontre aussi que l'impunité a influencé la conduite de l'armée, de la police, des Commissaires militaires et a favorisé la violence contre le peuple; que les Commissaires militaires se trouvaient au quatrième rang de la structure hiérarchique militaire; que les objectifs stratégiques de l'armée, dans ses efforts de militariser le pays dans les années 80, visaient à assumer un pouvoir presque absolu grâce à la création d'un système de contrôle parallèle, semi visible et très puissant; que les services d'intelligence ont joué un rôle décisif dans cet effort de militarisation qui a eu pour effet de violer les droits humains; que les services d'intelligence ont exercé un contrôle fondé non seulement sur ses propres structures mais aussi sur un réseau d'informateurs.
[39]
Enfin, la preuve documentaire démontre qu'il y a eu huit massacres dans la région de Chiquimula; que les Commissaires militaires, assujettis à la discipline de l'armée, étaient des agents civils de l'armée dans tous les hameaux du Guatemala, des représentants locaux et servaient d'intermédiaires entre l'armée et la communauté locale; que l'organisation des patrouilles civiles étaient souvent à la charge des Commissaires militaires et ils répondaient aux ordres de l'armée, contrairement aux déclarations de monsieur Aceve Acevedo; que même les hameaux les plus éloignés n'étaient pas épargnés; et qu'en 1995, le gouvernement a mis fin aux patrouilles civiles et aux Commissaires militaires dans la région de Chiquimula.
[40]
La Commission a tiré de nombreuses conclusions de non crédibilité concernant monsieur Aceve Acevedo.
[41]
Le témoignage de monsieur Aceve Acevedo lors de l'audience était vague, ambiguë et évasif. Il répétait les mêmes explications tout en évitant de répondre directement aux questions. Il s'est limité à dire qu'il ne faisait que veiller à ce que tout fonctionne bien et soit en ordre dans le village. Il a aussi dit qu'il n'y avait pas eu de massacres, de torture ou d'abus dans sa région.
[42]
Il est fort douteux, contrairement à ce que monsieur Aceve Acevedo allègue, que rien ne s'est passé dans sa région où il n'aurait fait que veiller à ce que tout soit en ordre, compte tenu de la preuve documentaire qui est très éloquente quant aux crimes commis par l'armée et aux nombreux massacres tant dans les régions rurales que urbaines.
[43]
Il est peu vraisemblable que la région où il habitait ait été totalement dépourvue de moyens de communication. La Commission ne croit pas que monsieur Aceve Acevedo puisse justifier son ignorance des faits en invoquant son analphabétisme.
[44]
Son témoignage changeant, notamment quant aux réunions des Commissaires et son refus de fournir plus de renseignements sur son rôle ont miné sa crédibilité. Son témoignage peu transparent sur ses connaissances générales des événements de la guerre civile et des activités dans sa propre région n'a fait que miner davantage sa crédibilité.
[45]
Les déclarations de monsieur Aceve Acevedo qu'il n'y avait aucun groupe indigène Maya dans sa région et qu'il n'y avait pas eu de massacres ne sont pas soutenues par la preuve documentaire qui situe entre 20 et 50 % de la population indigène dans cette région et établit que Chiquimula, zone militaire numéro 8, compte pour environ 0.5% des massacres perpétrés dans le pays (les massacres et disparitions sont évalués à plus de 200 000).
[46]
Il était visiblement mal à l'aise par les questions qui lui étaient posées sur les massacres de civils grâce à la participation des collaborateurs et informateurs qu'étaient les Commissaires militaires et les Patrouilles d'autodéfense civiles (PAC). La Commission a constaté qu'il était au courant des massacres perpétrés par l'armée.
[47]
Pour être jugée manifestement déraisonnable, il ne suffit pas qu'une conclusion soit erronée aux yeux de la Cour, il faut en outre qu'elle soit clairement irrationnelle, non conforme à la raison ou contraire au bon sens. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2000] A.C.S. no 23 (QL), au paragraphe 2; Canada (Procureur général) c. Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada, [1993] 1 R.C.S. 941, [1993] A.C.S. no 35, au paragraphe 44) Ce n'est que lorsque la preuve, examinée raisonnablement, ne peut servir de fondement aux conclusions du tribunal qu'une conclusion de fait sera manifestement déraisonnable. (Syndicat canadien de la Fonction publique, section locale 301 c. Montréal (Ville), [1997] 1 R.C.S. 793, [1997] A.C.S. no 39 (QL), au paragraphe 53)
[48]
Monsieur Aceve Acevedo n'a pas établi que ces conditions d'intervention étaient rencontrées en l'espèce. La décision de la Commission est des plus étoffées et il n'a pas été démontré que les conclusions ne reposent pas sur la preuve.
[49]
Après l'examen de l'ensemble de la preuve, la Commission a conclu : que monsieur Aceve Acevedo était conscient que sa collaboration avec l'armée pouvait entraîner des conséquences sérieuses sur les personnes qu'il dénonçait; que, compte tenu que la preuve documentaire établit que les forces armées du Guatemala ont été tenues coupables de crimes contre l'humanité, monsieur Aceve Acevedo s'est rendu coupable, par association, et est exclu de la protection de la Convention aux termes de l'alinéa 1Fa); qu'il n'y a aucun doute que monsieur Aceve Acevedo avait collaboré à titre de Commissaire militaire; que, comme collaborateur volontaire de l'armée guatémaltèque pendant quatorze ans, monsieur Aceve Acevedo ne pouvait ignorer ce qui se passait, par conséquent il avait été complice des responsabilités de tels massacres et le diplôme d'honneur remis pour ses loyaux services militait en ce sens.
[50]
La Commission a aussi déterminé : que monsieur Aceve Acevedo ne pouvait prétendre que rien ne se passait dans sa région compte tenu d'un article d'Amnistie Internationale traitant du procès célèbre d'un Commissaire militaire de cette région, accusé de crimes contre les habitants de la région; que monsieur Aceve Acevedo avait volontairement contribué avec des groupes paramilitaires don't les visées étaient limitées et brutales, tout comme celles de l'armée qui les contrôlait dans un réseau qui s'étendait à l'ensemble du pays; que par sa collaboration et sa participation aux activités de l'armée, monsieur Aceve Acevedo s'était rendu complice des mêmes crimes contre les populations civiles; que de son propre aveu, monsieur Aceve Acevedo était en accord avec les obligations qui lui étaient imposées par les autorités militaires en tant que Commissaire militaire et qu'il était conscient de son rôle d'informer son chef de ce qui se passait dans son secteur; qu'il était raisonnable de conclure que monsieur Aceve Acevedo devait connaître les conséquences de ses dénonciations et, par conséquent, les représailles de l'armée et que son rôle d'informateur lui conférait une responsabilité importante; qu'il était donc raisonnable de croire que monsieur Aceve Acevedo devait savoir que les activités de l'organisation paramilitaire don't il faisait partie mènerait vraisemblablement à la commission de crimes contre l'humanité.
[51]
Il était loisible à la Commission de s'appuyer sur la preuve documentaire pour apprécier le rôle des Commissaires militaires, leur collaboration avec l'armée et l'importance des massacres survenus à travers le pays, notamment dans la région du monsieur Aceve Acevedo.
[52]
Dans le cas particulier de monsieur Aceve Acevedo, le fait d'avoir été Commissaire militaire et collaborateur de l'armée, qui commettait des crimes contre l'humanité, permettait à la Commission de présumer de sa participation personnelle et consciente.
[53]
Compte tenu de la preuve et du droit applicable, il était raisonnable pour le tribunal de conclure que monsieur Aceve Acevedo s'était rendu coupable, par association, des crimes contre l'humanité commis par l'armée et était exclu de la protection de la Convention aux termes de l'alinéa 1Fa) de la Convention.
L'inclusion
[54]
La Commission a conclu que monsieur Aceve Acevedo a collaboré avec l'armée guatémaltèque et avait cherché à cacher le rôle qu'il a joué en tant que collaborateur militaire et que son témoignage, à ce titre, était peu transparent sur ses connaissances générales des événements de la guerre civile et des activités dans sa propre région.
[55]
La Commission a souligné que les autorités militaires lui avaient remis, à la fin de la guerre, un diplôme d'honneur en reconnaissance de ses loyaux services. Elle a également noté que bien qu'en 1995, le gouvernement ait mis fin aux patrouilles civiles et aux fonctions de Commissaires militaires, monsieur Aceve Acevedo n'a quitté l'organisation qu'en 1997 parce qu'elle a été abolie par le gouvernement en place.
[56]
La Commission a conclu que les réponses de monsieur Aceve Acevedo, quant à l'identité des agresseurs et des motifs de leurs menaces, étaient vagues et peu concluantes. Cette lacune dans le témoignage de monsieur Aceve Acevedo supporte la conclusion de la Commission que faute d'explications claires et pertinentes, elle ne pouvait croire les allégations de persécution.
[57]
Compte tenu de son manque de crédibilité, eu égard à ses allégations de persécution, la Commission a conclu qu'il n'avait pas établi de lien avec la Convention et qu'il craignait une vengeance éventuelle de la part de victimes d'actes qu'il avait commis en sa qualité de Commissaires militaires.
[58]
Cette conclusion n'est pas manifestement déraisonnable. L'appréciation de la preuve objective relève du mandat de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 5) Il lui appartient d'apprécier la plausibilité du témoignage des revendicateurs et d'en tirer des inférences. Celles-ci doivent être maintenues dans la mesure où elles ne sont pas déraisonnables au point de nécessiter l'intervention de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
[59]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] A.C.F. no 960 (QL), au paragraphe 25, le juge Edmond Blanchard a rappelé que la crainte de représailles motivées par la vengeance ou le fait d'être victime d'un acte criminel ne constitue pas un motif de persécution tel que prévu par l'article 96 de la Loi.
[60]
L'appréciation du risque de persécution est une question de fait qui appelle une grande retenue judiciaire. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL))
[61]
Il appartient à la personne qui demande le statut de réfugié d'établir les éléments subjectifs et objectifs requis pour satisfaire à la définition de réfugié au sens de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] A.C.F. no 539 (QL), au paragraphe 22)
La protection de l'État
[62]
Au paragraphe 9 de la déclaration contenue dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels, monsieur Aceve Acevedo a déclaré :
Nous n'avons pas averti la police, parce qu'ils nous ont obligé de nous taire, parce qu'ils nous avaient dit que, si nous le faisions, ils tueraient toute la famille.
[63]
Par ailleurs, il importe de rappeler que la Commission n'a pas jugé crédible les allégations de persécution de monsieur Aceve Acevedo.
[64]
D'autre part, le fait que monsieur Aceve Acevedo ait demandé et obtenu l'aide de son ami, le maire de Concepcion las Minas, pour quitter le pays ne satisfait pas à la demande de protection qui lui incombait. De son propre aveu, tel que mentionné plus haut, il n'a pas demandé la protection aux autorités policières.
[65]
Monsieur Aceve Acevedo soutient que la Commission a ignoré les pièces P-5 et P-6, à savoir deux lettres qui font état du fait que son épouse a reçu un message anonyme l'informant que l'on recherchait son époux et, qu'ayant eu peur, elle avait demandé de l'aide à monsieur Rigoberto Espinosa qui l'avait logée chez lui, avec toute sa famille, dans un autre village.
[66]
La présomption que la Commission a examiné toute la preuve doit prévaloir en l'espèce. De plus, les pièces P-5 et P-6 n'ont pas d'incidence sur la conclusion de la Commission relative à la protection de l'État. Ils n'indiquent pas que la famille de monsieur Aceve Acevedo a sollicité la protection des autorités.
[67]
Il est permis de croire qu'en concluant que monsieur Aceve Acevedo n'avait pas indiqué que les autres membres de sa famille étaient en danger dans son pays, la Commission a tenu compte des pièces P-5 et P-6 qui ne sont pas concluantes eu égard à la sécurité des membres de la famille.
[68]
La question de la protection de son propre pays, don't doit se prévaloir le revendicateur avant de réclamer celle d'un autre pays, fait partie intégrante de la définition de réfugié au sens de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] A.C.F. no 1020 (QL), au paragraphe 12)
[69]
Plus le pays d'un revendicateur jouit d'institutions démocratiques, plus il doit épuiser les recours qui lui sont offerts dans ce pays avant de demander la protection d'un autre pays. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 5)
[70]
La conclusion de la Commission quant à la protection de l'État est donc bien fondée.
L'article 97
[71]
Monsieur Aceve Acevedo soutient que la Commission a erré en expurgeant la notion de menaces à la vie prévue au paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi.
[72]
Une analyse distincte sous le paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi n'est pas toujours requise et ne l'était pas en l'espèce.
[73]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] A.C.F. no 2013 (QL), au paragraphe 22, le juge Richard Mosley s'est ainsi exprimé :
La Cour semble être arrivée à un consensus selon lequel une analyse séparée de l'article 97 n'est pas requise lorsqu'il n'y a pas de preuve pouvant démontrer que le demandeur a la qualité de personne à protéger : voir les décisions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[74]
En l'espèce, la Commission a conclu que les réponses de monsieur Aceve Acevedo étaient peu concluantes quant à l'identité des agresseurs, qu'il manquait de crédibilité quant à ses allégations de persécution et qu'il n'avait pas demandé la protection des autorités.

Dans l'affaire  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Martineau a précisé que l'absence de crédibilité du demandeur et les autres motifs indiqués dans la décision pouvaient permettre à la Commission de conclure que le demandeur n'était pas une personne à protéger :
A cet égard, la Commission pouvait raisonnablement conclure qu'il n'y avait aucun motif sérieux de croire que le demandeur risquait d'Ltre personnellement soumis B la torture en se fondant sur l'absence de crédibilité du demandeur et sur les autres motifs indiqués dans la décision. Le demandeur ne m'a pas convaincu que la Commission a, ce faisant, ignoré la preuve documentaire qui, en elle-mLme, n'est pas concluante et ne permet pas de conclure que le demandeur serait une personne visée par l'alinéa 97(1)a) de la Loi.
[76]
La conclusion au sujet de la protection de l'État, examinée plus haut, est également déterminante eu égard à l'appréciation de la demande fondée sur l'article 97. Cet article précise le cas où la menace à la vie ou le risque de traitements cruels et inusités permet de reconnaître le statut de personne à protéger. Il faut notamment que le revendicateur ne puisse ou ne veuille se réclamer de la protection de son pays.
[77]
Ainsi, l'omission de la Commission de faire une analyse distincte selon l'article 97 en l'espèce n'est pas déterminante compte tenu des autres conclusions qu'elle a tirées et qui, elles, sont déterminantes.
[78]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 13, le juge Judith Snider a ainsi conclu, sur ce point :
Il aurait été préférable que la Commission déclare clairement qu'elle ne disposait d'aucun élément de preuve convaincant lié aux motifs de l'article 97. Toutefois, son omission de le faire en l'espèce ne constitue pas, à mon avis, une erreur. Cependant, même si la Commission avait commis une erreur, je conclurais que cette erreur était sans importance ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F.) (QL)).
CONCLUSION
[79]
La décision de la Commission n'est pas manifestement déraisonnable. Ainsi, puisque rien ne justifie l'intervention de cette Cour, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.
JUGEMENT

 Devereaux worked for Sedpex Inc. as an assistant driller on an offshore drilling rig. His job was terminated. He complained under the Canada Labour Code that he was unjustly dismissed. An adjudicator (Browne) was appointed. Sedpex raised a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the adjudicator. Sedpex argued that the adjudicator lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter because Devereaux was laid off because of a lack of work which precluded consideration of his complaint by the adjudicator. The adjudicator ruled that Devereaux was not laid off because of a lack of work and he had jurisdiction. Sedpex applied for a writ of prohibition to prohibit the adjudicator from proceeding.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, dismissed the prohibition application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Labour Law - Topic 6037

 Strayer, J. 
 : This is an application for a writ of prohibition to prevent Dennis M. Browne, an adjudicator appointed under s. 61.5 of the Canada Labour Code [see footnote 1], from proceeding further with hearing the complaint of John Devereaux that he was unjustly dismissed by the applicant Sedpex Inc.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Background Facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2] 
  Mr. Devereaux was hired in March 1983, as a derrickman on an offshore drilling rig, Sedco 710, operating off the coast of Newfoundland. He was originally hired by Sedco Inc., a sister corporation of Sedpex and his contract was transferred to Sedpex in May 1983. He was promoted to the position of assistant driller on that rig on April 5, 1984. He was one of four assistant drillers employed on that rig. On any given shift there would be a driller and an assistant driller on duty with another similar team on board available to work alternate shifts. This would continue for three weeks and then those two teams would be replaced by two other teams who would in the meantime have been onshore and off duty for three weeks.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [3] 
  Devereaux continued working as an assistant driller on this rig until February 1986. While off duty and onshore he was involved on February 14, 1986, in an automobile accident which rendered him unfit to return to work at the time he was due back, namely on February 28, 1986. During Devereaux's absence Sedpex arranged for Alan Langevin, a driller on a rig operated by Sedco Forex (Sedpex's parent corporation) in the North Sea, to be transferred temporarily to Sedco 710 to work as an assistant driller in place of Devereaux. On April 7, 1986, Devereaux's doctor advised Sedpex that Devereaux would be fit to return to work on April 11, 1986. On April 9, 1986, Sedco 710 received instructions from Sedpex headquarters in the United States advising that the Sedco 703 drill rig in the North Sea from which Langevin had come was idle "with no near work prospects" so "that unit is no longer able to provide Allen [sic] a job". The telex went on to direct Sedco 710 to offer Langevin a permanent position on Sedco 710 if he was prepared to accept a reduction in status from driller to assistant driller. The telex further said:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "To maintain 710 staffing levels within your authorized complement, this would require laying off one individual presently assigned to the rig, who should probably be your weakest assistant driller. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 As a result Devereaux was advised orally on April 11th, and by letter on April 14th, that his service with Sedpex Inc. was being terminated at once. Soon thereafter Devereaux filed a complaint under s. 61.5 of the Canada Labour Code, alleging unjust dismissal. In October 1986, the Minister of Labour appointed Dennis M. Browne to be an adjudicator to hear this complaint. The adjudication hearing commenced at St. John's, Newfoundland on August 13, 1987, and was continued on September 15, 1987. Sedpex raised a preliminary objection that the adjudicator was without jurisdiction to hear the matter because Devereaux had been "laid off because of lack of work" as referred to in s. 61.5(3)(a) of the Code, which would preclude consideration of a complaint in such circumstances. The adjudicator heard the evidence of Joe Bryant, District Manager of Sedpex Inc. for eastern Canada in April 1986, who was examined and cross-examined before him. He also received a number of exhibits put in through Mr. Bryant. He delivered a written decision on January 20, 1988, dealing only with this preliminary issue. He concluded that Devereaux was not terminated due to lack of work and that therefore he was not precluded from hearing the complaint. He sought to continue the hearing of the complaint but Sedpex Inc. brought these proceedings for prohibition to prevent him from doing so.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Legislative Framework  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [4] 
  Section 61.5 was inserted in the Code to provide, in effect, a grievance procedure for federally-regulated employees not protected by collective bargaining agreements, allowing them to file complaints with respect to unjust dismissal. Where such a complaint is filed and the matter is not otherwise sealed the Minister can appoint an adjudicator. If the adjudicator after holding a hearing concludes that the person was unjustly dismissed he can order compensation or reinstatement of that person or some other appropriate remedy. Subsection 61.5(14) specifically provides that no civil remedy which an employee may have against his employer is suspended or affected by this section. The most relevant subsections for the purposes of the present proceeding are the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "61.5(3) No complainant shall be considered by an adjudicator under subsection (8) in respect of a person where  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (a) the person has been laid off because of lack of work or because of the discontinuance of a function; or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (b) a procedure for redress has been provided elsewhere in or under this or any other Act of Parliament.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "61.5(7) An adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subsection (6)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (a) shall consider the complaint within such time as the Governor-in-Council may by regulation prescribe;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (b) shall determine his own procedure, but shall give full opportunity to the parties to the complaint to present evidence and make submissions to him and shall consider the information relating to the complaint referred to him under subsection (6); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (c) has, in relation to any complaint before him, the powers conferred on the Canada Labour Relations Board, in relation to any proceeding before the Board, by paragraphs 118(a), (b) and (c).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "61.5(8) An adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subsection (6) shall consider whether the dismissal of the person who made the complaint was unjust and shall render a decision thereon and send a copy of the decision with the reasons therefor to each party and to the Minister.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "61.5(10) Every order of an adjudicator appointed under subsection (6) is final and shall not be questioned or reviewed in any court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "61.5(11) No order shall be made, process entered or proceeding taken in any court, whether by way of injunction, certiorari, prohibition, quo warranto or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or restrain an adjudicator in any of his proceedings under this section. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Scope and Criteria for Judicial Review Herein  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [5] 
  It should first be noted that this is an application to the Trial Division for prohibition under s. 18 of the Federal Court Act and not an application to the Federal Court of Appeal for judicial review under s. 28 of that Act. It appears to me that the application is properly made to this Division. The conclusion reached by the adjudicator that he had jurisdiction was not a "decision or order" as referred to in s. 28(1) of the Federal Court Act. It was not a final decision but only a preliminary assumption upon which the adjudicator would proceed to a determination of the complaint before him. Such preliminary conclusions as to jurisdiction have been held not "decisions" at all [see footnote 2]. When a final determination of a complaint has been made by an adjudicator that determination then becomes subject to review under s. 28 [see footnote 3].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [6] 
  It is also important to note the privative clauses, ss. 61.5(10) and (11) quoted above. While s. 61.5(10) might in any event be irrelevant as no "order" has been made by the adjudicator, s. 61.5(11) which purports to preclude any court process "to ... prohibit or restrain an adjudicator in any of his proceedings" might be thought to apply. However, it has long been established that, notwithstanding such privative clauses, if a tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction then judicial review of its decision is permissible on the jurisdictional issue [see footnote 4]. Further, the courts have greatly expanded the concept of jurisdictional error to include decisions made in bad faith, decisions made on irrelevant material, decisions made without regard to relevant material, misinterpretations of statutes, and breaches of natural justice [see footnote 5].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [7] 
  Where a court thus has to determine whether a tribunal acted within its jurisdiction it has been held that scrutiny must go beyond the mere determination that the tribunal's decision was not patently unreasonable. As was stated by Beetz, J.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  des employés de production du Québec et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  jurisdiction, and has been the subject of a decision by an administrative tribunal, the superior court exercising the superintending and reforming power over that tribunal cannot, without itself refusing to exercise its own jurisdiction, refrain from ruling on the correctness of that decision, or rule on it by means of an approximate criterion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "This is why the superior courts which exercise the power of judicial review do not and may not use the rule of the patently unreasonable error once they have classified an error as jurisdictional. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 In theory, this means that the reviewing court must satisfy itself that the decision of the tribunal as to its jurisdiction was correct both as to the law and the facts. One must, of course, recognize that "correctness" is a relative, not an absolute, term. Questions of law are always open to debate, but we accept as the "correct" determination of law that which is, in our legal system, the most authoritative. Thus for both functional and doctrinal reasons courts are viewed as being the most authoritative in determining what is the law. It follows that a judicial opinion, perhaps clarified and sanctified by the appeal process, is deemed to be the "correct" view of what the law is for purposes of determining the jurisdiction of the tribunal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [8] 
  With respect to the "correctness" of facts, however, it must be recognized that neither a tribunal nor a court ever can be said to have pronounced incontestably the correct version of past events. Those events can never be reproduced. What fact-determination bodies produce, instead are  
 findings 
  of fact which must stand in place of the facts themselves. Depending on the processes involved in reaching them, such findings may to a greater or lesser degree correspond to what actually happened. It is pushing judicial self-esteem beyond the bounds of decency to assume that courts will always, be in a better position to make such findings. The legal system recognizes that some procedures and institutions are more likely to produce accurate findings of fact than are others. Thus for example appellate courts normally defer to the factual findings of trial courts, particularly where there are issues of credibility which are thought to be better assessed by the judge who hears and sees the witness, unless such findings of fact are "clearly wrong" [see footnote 7]. Further, it has been said that even where there are no such issues of credibility  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "[a]n appellate court is not, however, even in that circumstances, entitled to substitute its views for those of the trial judge simply because it would have concluded differently, the appellate court must conclude that he was wrong [see footnote 8]. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 It will be noted that appellate courts take this cautious approach, even though they typically have before them a complete transcript of the evidence taken before the trial court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [9] 
  This suggests that a court should embark with some caution on assessing the "correctness" of jurisdictional facts determined by a tribunal. This is particularly true where, as in the present case, I do not have before me a transcript of the oral evidence taken before the adjudicator, nor as far as I can see do I have any new evidence before me that was not before the adjudicator. Indeed, the only evidence before me consists of two affidavits sworn by employees of the applicant which briefly describe the evidence that was put before the adjudicator much more fully and by viva voce evidence. Dickson, J., stated it thus in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  It is hard to conceive that a legislature would create a tribunal with a limited jurisdiction and yet bestow on such tribunal an unlimited power to determine the extent of its jurisdiction. On the other hand, if the correctness of every detail upon which the jurisdiction of the tribunal depends is to be subject to re-trial in the Courts and the opinion of a judge substituted for that of the tribunal, then the special experience and knowledge of the members of such a tribunal and the advantage they have of hearing and seeing the witnesses may be lost. The power to review jurisdictional questions provides the Courts with a useful tool to ensure that tribunals deal with the type of issues which the Legislature intended. It enables the Courts to check unlawful attempts at usurpation of power. But the Courts, in my opinion, should exercise restraint in declaring a tribunal to be without jurisdiction when it has reached its decision honesty and fairly and with due regard to the material before it. The Court should allow some latitude in its surveillance of jurisdictional findings. It should ask whether there is substantial evidence for decisions of fact and a rational basis for decisions of law, or mixed decisions of fact and law. The error must be manifest. The role of the Court is one of review, not trial de novo. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Consistently with this approach, I believe that it would be inconsistent with the purposes of s. 61.5 if the Trial Division of this court were to make de novo and routine factual determinations for the purposes of s. 61.5(3)(a) as to whether a person has been laid off because of lack of work, prior to the adjudicator having the opportunity to hear all the evidence and make a final decision which can be reviewed by the Federal Court of Appeal under s. 28.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [11] 
  I therefore conclude from the foregoing that s. 61.5(3)(a) does involve a question of jurisdiction and that I can review the conclusions of the adjudicator for the purpose of determining whether he has jurisdiction to proceed with the complaint. In doing so it is open to me to form my own opinions as to the relevant questions of law but that with respect to his findings of fact I should not substitute my own view for his unless his can be demonstrated to be manifestly wrong [see footnote 10].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Conclusions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [12] 
  The most relevant portion of the adjudicator's findings with respect to whether Mr. Devereaux was dismissed because of lack of work, and therefore whether the adjudicator had jurisdiction to proceed with hearing the complaint, was as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "In this instance, the complainant was dismissed from his permanent employment as an assistant driller because the respondent preferred to hire on a permanent basis the employee who had been replacing the complainant while the latter was on sick leave. The employer witness did make reference to a slow down in the North Sea operation which may have resulted in a lack of work but there was no evidence whatsoever of a slow down or lack of work in the offshore area in which the Sedco 710 was operating at the time this complaint was made. There is no evidence that other employees on the Sedco 710 were affected in any way by the slow down in the North Sea operation. The only employee who appears to have been affected by a lay-off seems to have been the complainant. The scenario that the employer presents of having five assistant drillers for four positions was essentially the employees own creation. Thus, there was no lack of work per se on the Sedco 710 based on legitimate considerations. To this end, I find that the termination of the complainant based on lack of work was, in fact, a sham. If the respondent were to succeed in these circumstances, the recourse offered employees through Division V.7, Part III of the Canada Labour Code could be reduced to a nullity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "I find based upon the evidence that the complainant was not terminated due to lack of work but because the respondent preferred to retain the complainant's replacement when the complainant returned from sick leave. The respondent has not discharged its burden of satisfying this adjudicator that there was a lack of work ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The applicant contends that these findings involved errors of fact and law. I do not agree.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [13] 
  With respect to a possible error of law, it appears to me that the adjudicator has properly interpreted s. 61.5(3)(a). It is implicit in his conclusions that a person should not be considered to have been "laid-off because of lack of work" unless that was the real, essential, operative reason for the termination of his employment. It is obvious that employees' jobs are frequently terminated for a combination of reasons. That does not mean that because one factor in dismissal is the fact that there is another person available to do the job, the termination is automatically due to lack of work". Nor does it mean that because the employer says that he no longer needs the employee in question the termination of employment must automatically be regarded as due to "lack of work". Difficult as it may be in some cases, the question which the statute requires to be answered, in my view, is as to whether the actual operative and dominant reason for the termination was "lack of work". I am satisfied that that is the question which the adjudicator put to himself in this case when he concluded that the alleged reason of "lack of work" was a "sham".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [14] 
  Nor can I find any reviewable error of fact committed by the adjudicator. As noted earlier, I am limited in the extent to which I can substitute my view of the facts for that of the adjudicator. He heard the only witness to be called as yet, Mr. Bryant, who was District Manager of Sedpex Inc. during the period in question. The adjudicator heard the examination and cross-examination of Mr. Bryant, and his explanations with respect to the exhibits. I have heard none of these nor do I have a transcript of his evidence. I am unable to say that the adjudicator had no evidence or no substantial evidence upon which he could conclude that the reason for the termination of Devereaux's employment was the preference of Sedpex Inc. to employ Langevin instead. The adjudicator correctly held - and the applicant does not dispute this - that the burden was on Sedpex Inc. to show that the reason for the lay-off was lack of work. It was certainly open to the adjudicator to find that this burden of proof had not been met. Throwing serious doubt on any such contention by the employer were several documents put into evidence by the employer itself demonstrating that the employer for some time had serious doubts as to Devereaux's competence to be an Assistant Driller. There were unfavourable evaluations on him as Assistant Driller as early as May 1985, and a memorandum at about that time from the drilling superintendent to Mr. Bryant saying in part concerning Mr. Devereaux,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "... I think we should start looking at replacing him as asst. driller soon. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 A note sent to him on November 10, 1985, from another drilling superintendent advised Mr. Devereaux that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "This is your final warning, any further incidents will lead to dismissal! <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 These were followed by other negative comments on the file by his supervisor, and a personnel evaluation of March 3, 1986, of over 50 employees on the Sedco 710 drill rig of which Devereaux received the lowest rating. Further, the evidence showed that after Devereaux's automobile accident Mr. Langevin was brought in on a temporary basis and he was not offered a permanent position on Sedco 710 until the company had been advised by Devereaux's doctor that Devereaux could return to work. It was at that point that Langevin was offered a permanent position. Once Langevin accepted this position the result was that if Devereaux returned there would be five Assistant Drillers to occupy four positions. At that point Devereaux was terminated. It was certainly open to the adjudicator on the basis of this evidence to conclude that the real, operative, reason for Devereaux's dismissal was the company's belief that he was not competent to do the job or not as competent as Langevin.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [15] 
  It is precisely that belief which can be explored if the adjudicator continues with the hearing. In declining to reject the conclusion of the adjudicator that Devereaux's dismissal was not due to lack of work and in holding that the adjudicator has jurisdiction to hear the complaint, I am of course in no way prejudging the result of the hearing by the adjudicator on the merits. Counsel for the applicant, in his thorough and lucid argument, referred me to several decisions of adjudicators which had favoured employers. Some stress was placed on "management rights" to determine who shall work and who shall not. I do not question the right of management to dismiss for just cause and it remains open to the applicant here to challenge Devereaux's complaint that his dismissal was unjust. But I am not prepared to prohibit the adjudicator from addressing that question because I do not believe the applicant has demonstrated that the adjudicator has, in assuming jurisdiction, committed any reviewable error of law or of fact.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [16] 
  The application will therefore be dismissed. The respondent requested that, if I dismissed the application, I order costs against the applicant on a solicitor and client basis. Counsel based this request on the insubstantiality of the applicant's case. Normally costs should not be awarded on a solicitor and client basis just because of the lack of merits in the case of the losing party, but instead because of the manner in which the proceedings have been conducted. I can find nothing reprehensible in the way the applicant has conducted its case. It is regrettable for the due administration of s. 61.5 that these proceedings will have delayed the adjudicator for a year or so in dealing with the merits. But this was a recourse which the applicant was legally entitled to pursue because of the supervisory role courts have assured for themselves in matters of jurisdiction. I therefore award costs against the applicant, but only on a party and party basis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Application dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Editor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/nmg  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Footnotes  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  1.

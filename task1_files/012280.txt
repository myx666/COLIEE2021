 Teitelbaum, J. 
 : This is an application for:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "A. An Order for a retroactive extension of time pursuant to s. 56(1) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  to appeal the decision of the respondent The Registrar of Trademarks ('The Registrar') dated November 30, 1992 in the matter of an opposition by the appellant Toys 'R' Us (Canada) Ltd. to Application No. 586,352 for the trademark NUTS 'R' US filed by the respondent Manjel Inc. ('Manjel') and for a leave to file a Notice of Appeal against said decision, a copy of which is attached hereto as Schedule 'A';  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "B. An Order for a retroactive extension of time pursuant to ss. 56(2) and 56(3) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  to file with this Honourable Court and the respondent The Registrar the Notice of Appeal attached as Schedule 'A' and to serve same on the solicitors for the respondent Manjel;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "C. An Order for a retroactive extension of time pursuant to s. 56(5) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  and rule 704 of the  
 Rules of the Federal Court 
  to file and serve the proposed additional evidence, copies of which are attached hereto in bulk as Schedule 'B';  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "D. An Order to stay pursuant to s. 50 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  the proceedings before the respondent The Registrar with respect to Application No. 586,352 in the Trademarks Office until such time as a final judgment is rendered by this Honourable Court on the requests made pursuant to paragraphs A, B and C above; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [2] 
  The grounds, as given by the appellants (applicants) in the notice of motion are many. Suffice it to say that it is the submission of the appellants that virtually the entire decision is invalid and that because of certain administrative errors on the part of appellants' trademark agents, the appellants were unable to file their appeal within the delays stipulated in s. 56(1) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, that is, within a delay of two months from the date on which notice of the decision was dispatched by the Registrar.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  There appears to be little, if any, difference between the parties as it relates to the facts.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  On April 27, 1987, Manjel Inc. (Manjel), one of the respondents herein, filed Application No. 586,352 in the Trademarks Office to register the trademark "Nuts 'R' Us" based upon use in Canada since March 1987 with services identified as:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "the operation of a retail outlet for the sale of popping corn kernels, shelled nuts, nuts, chocolates, candies, candied coated peanuts, snack foods comprising a mixture of nuts; novelty items containing any one of the following items, popping corn kernels, shelled nuts, nuts, chocolates, candies, candied coated peanuts, or snack foods comprising mixtures of nuts,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "and in association with the following wares:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "popping corn kernels, shelled nuts, nuts, chocolates, candies, candied coated peanuts, snack foods comprising a mixture of nuts; novelty items containing popping corn kernels, shelled nuts, nuts, chocolates, candies, candied coated peanuts, or snack goods comprising mixtures of nuts. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [5] 
  Exhibit "A" to the affidavit of Dayle Brands sworn to on June 15, 1993 indicates that on March 6, 1987 a Marie Louise Rodricks (the wife of Neville Rodricks, the Executive Vice-President of Manjel) registered a declaration to carry on a business to be known as Nuts "R" Us. The said registration was to expire on March 5, 1992. As of June 9, 1993, the registration was not renewed (Exhibit "B", affidavit of Dayle Brands of June 15, 1993).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  On March 30, 1989, Toys "R" Us (Canada Ltd.) filed a statement of opposition against application No. 586,352 filed by Manjel. The application covers various snack food items as well as the operation of retail outlets selling snack foods.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Toys "R" Us (Canada) Ltd. currently operates forty-four (44) retail stores in Canada under the trademark "Toys 'R' Us" and in such retail stores, it offers for sale candy, confectionery and snack foods.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The appellant (applicant) Geoffrey Toys (Canada) Ltd. became the owner on April 13, 1992 of the trademark "Toys 'R' Us". Prior to April 13, 1992, Toys "R" Us (Canada) was the owner of this trademark and following the April 13, 1992 assignment, Toys "R" Us (Canada) Ltd. became a licensee of the trademark in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  I would mention that a number of other trademarks were mentioned before the Registrar of Trademarks and in the documents filed by the appellants. They are "R Us" and "Kids 'R' Us". These two trademarks are of no concern with regard to the present application as counsel for the appellants has informed me that the appellants are not relying on the use of the trademark "Kids 'R' Us" nor on the trademark "R Us". There therefore is no "family of trademarks" of concern in the present application. The appellants rely only on the use of the trademark "Toys 'R' Us" for the purposes of the present application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  The opposition filed by Toys "R" Us (Canada) Ltd. to the application by Manjel for the trademark "Nuts 'R' Us" was, according to the appellants, essentially based on the likelihood of confusion between the trademark "Toys 'R' Us" and the trademark "Nuts 'R' Us".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  I use the term trademark for "Toys 'R' Us". "Toys 'R' Us" is a trademark design (Exhibit "A" to the affidavit of Robert W. Sterling, June 11, 1993).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  The hearing of the opposition took place on November 5, 1992. On November 30, 1992, G.W. Partington, Chairman, Trademarks Opposition Board, handed down his decision wherein he rejected the opposition of Toys "R" Us (Canada) Ltd. The decision was sent to Toys "R" Us (Canada) Ltd.'s trademark agent and was received on December 3, 1992. According to the affidavit of Marie-Claude Baril, a stagiaire with the firm of Swabey Ogilvy Renault, she states that as of May 1992, she was assigned the file wherein Toys "R" Us (Canada) Ltd. had opposed the trademark application of Manjel. She states that the hearing on the opposition occurred on November 5, 1992. On November 11, 1992 she wrote to the firm of Darby & Darby, American attorneys from whom she was receiving instructions concerning the hearing and informed them:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "We now presume that a written decision will issue within the next three (3) months or so. As soon as the decision is available, we will of course let you know. In the meantime, we take the opportunity to enclose our debit note for services and disbursements rendered in this connection to date." (Exhibit MCB-1 to Baril affidavit)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  As a result, Ms. Baril diaryed the file for February 20, 1993. Ms. Baril also states that it is unusual for a decision to be given within a delay of three weeks. Nevertheless, she states that the decision was received on December 3, 1992, that she read the decision and "au meilleur de ma connaissance, d'avoir dicté une lettre aux procureurs américains leur faisant part de la décision défavorable du Registraire des marques de commerce et leur transmettant une copie de la décision". I am satisfied that if she did dictate such a letter, and I have certain doubts as to this, as she does not state to whom she dictated the letter, and no copy of a letter can be found, it was never received by the firm of Darby & Darby.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  In any event she states that it was only on May 28, 1993 when she returned to her office from having gone on maternity leave on December 23, 1992 that she was told that the American firm of attorneys representing the appellants were never informed of the Registrar's decision of November 30, 1992.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  I am satisfied from reading the affidavit of Ms. Baril and of John D. Miller sworn to on June 9, 1993 that due to unfortunate circumstances in the procedure followed at the office of Swabey Ogilvy Renault, appellants' trademark agents, American counsel for the appellants had not been informed of the Registrar's decision until May 29, 1993. As Mr. Paul Fields, a lawyer and partner with the law firm of Darby & Darby states in his affidavit of August 12, 1993:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "On May 28, 1993, I was advised by John D. Miller of Swabey Ogilvy Renault that the decision of the Registrar of Trademarks had been rendered November 30, 1992 rejecting the opposition by Toys 'R' Us (Canada) Ltd. to Application No. 586,352. Prior to May 28, 1993, I was not aware that the decision of the Registrar had been rendered. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [16] 
  Mr. Peter W. Weiss, President and Director of the appellant Geoffrey Toys (Canada) Ltd., in his affidavit sworn to on June 8, 1993 states in para. 4 that it was only on June 2, 1993 that he was first informed of the decision of the Registrar and that "no one from my company was previously made aware of the decision of the Registrar".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Mr. Jeffrey Sarfin, Vice-President, Finance and Administration, and a Director of Toys "R" Us (Canada) Ltd., in his affidavit sworn to on June 7, 1993, states in para. 6 that it was only on June 3, 1993 that he was informed of the Registrar's decision and that "no one from my company was advised that the decision of the Registrar had been rendered prior to June 3, 1993".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  It appears clear that due to the administrative errors on the part of appellants' trademark agents, they did not have knowledge of the Registrar's decision before June 2, 1993 for the appellant Geoffrey Toys (Canada) Ltd. and before June 3, 1993 for the appellant Toys "R" Us (Canada) Ltd. They, therefore, would not be in a position to decide whether or not to appeal the decision of the Federal Court at least until that date, that is, June 2 or 3, 1993.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  I am satisfied from the above evidence that the appellants were in no way responsible for being in the impossible position to file an appeal from the Registrar's decision within the delay stipulated in s. 56(1) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  which states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "56(1) An appeal lies to the Federal Court from any decision of the Registrar under this Act within two months from the date on which notice of the decision was dispatched by the Registrar or within such further time as the court may allow, either before or after the expiration of the two months. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [20] 
  As a result of the appellants being in the impossible position to appeal the Registrar's decision within the delay stipulated in s. 56(1) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 , the appellants present the present application, pursuant to s. 56(1) to extend the delays to file an appeal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  It therefore must be determined as to what the present appellants (applicants) must show in order to be granted an extension of time to file an appeal of a Registrar's decision more than two months "from the date on which notice of the decision was dispatched by the Registrar".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  The appellants have filed a Book of Authorities. In the case of  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) a case involving the  
 Income Tax Act 
  and where the issue was, as in the present case, the request for an extension of time to file an appeal, Smith, D.J., states, at pp. 5136, 5137 and 5138, what he considers must be shown before an extension of time will be granted:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(Power to grant extension)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The power of the court to grant an extension of time to appeal is discretionary. There are no rigid rules for determining when the extension should be granted. The decision is always to be made on the circumstances of the particular case, but there are guides to assist the court in reaching the right decision. Thus in a number of cases it has been stated  
 that the fundamental principle is to see that justice is done 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In relation to the question of bona fides of the applicant for an extension of time to appeal the courts have frequently stated that  
 the applicant must show a bona fide intention to appeal 
  while the right of appeal existed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "So far as the merits of an application for an extension of time to appeal are concerned,  
 it must be at least arguable 
  that the judgment appealed from is wrong." (Underlining is mine)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  In the case of  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. C.), wherein the respondent (applicant) sought an order under s. 82 of the  
 Exchequer Court Act 
 , R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, allowing it an extension of time to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, a decision pronounced September 20, 1967, President Jackett states what must be shown before such an application may be granted. At pp. 249 and 250, he states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Section 82 of the  
 Exchequer Court Act 
 , R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, requires that an appeal from a final judgment of this court to the Supreme Court of Canada be brought by serving and filing a notice of appeal and by depositing $50 by way of security for costs 'within 60 days ... from the signing or entry or pronouncing of the judgment appeal from' or 'within such further time as a judge of the Exchequer Court ... may either before or after the expiry of the said 60 days fix or allow'. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [24] 
  At page 252, he states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In the first place, it must be realized that a provision such as s. 82 of the  
 Exchequer Court Act 
  imposes upon the judge a judicial discretion and that there can be no hard and fast rules according to which it may be determined how it should be exercised in any particular case except that it must be exercised judiciously and not arbitrarily or capriciously. Leave should be given 'when "the interests of justice require that course to be adopted", having regard to the special circumstances of each case'. [ 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . See also  
 Cusack and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1931] 3 W.W.R. 335; 26 Alta. R. 69.] that has arisen in the past is where a decision to appeal was taken within the ordinary appeal period but, by reason of a mistake made by a legal adviser, the proper steps were not taken in time. While, at one time, a hard position was taken pretty generally with regard to such errors, the position would now seem to be that, providing the party who holds the judgment being attacked can be protected by appropriate terms, an extension of time will ordinarily be granted to a person who had a bona fide intention to appeal during the normal appeal period and who has proceeded with due despatch.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Lamont, J., who, at p. 266, in refusing an extension of time for applying for leave to appeal under the  
 Railway Act 
 , R.S.C. 1927, c. 170, indicated that, in his opinion, what had happened there showed that the applicant 'had no bona fide intention of appealing'.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "An obvious exception to a requirement of an intention to appeal during the normal appeal period exists if both the court and the party who now desires to appeal have been kept in the dark as to the circumstances that make an appeal expedient. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [25] 
  Therefore, it appears clear that a judge has the discretion to grant or not grant an extension of time to appeal pursuant to s. 56(1) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  but that this discretion must be exercised judiciously and not arbitrarily or capriciously. Leave should be granted where it is in the interests of justice to do so and this is determined having regard to the special circumstances of each case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  In the case before me, and as I have already indicated, the appellants (applicants) were not made aware of the Registrar's decision,  
 though no fault of their own 
 , until June 2 and 3, 1993. They therefore, as I have stated, were not in a position to appeal the decision of the Registrar, if it was their wish to appeal, until June 2 or 3, 1993.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Did the appellants have the intention to appeal? That is, had the appellants been informed of the decision soon after December 3, 1992, would they have appealed the decision? I believe the answer is in the affirmative.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  In the affidavit of Peter W. Weiss of June 8, 1993, he states in para. 5:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "My Company decided on June 2, 1993 that it wished to appeal the decision of the Registrar of Trademarks on this opposition. Had my Company been made aware of the Registrar's decision at the time that it issued, it would have instructed its attorneys forthwith to appeal the Registrar's decision. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [29] 
  In the affidavit of Jeffrey Sarfin of June 7, 1993, he states in para. 8:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "As soon as my Company was made aware of the decision of the Registrar on June 3, 1993, it decided that it wished to appeal the decision. If my Company had been made aware of the decision of the Registrar when it was rendered, we would have immediately instructed our attorneys to appeal the decision. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [30] 
  I have no evidence to contradict these two statements. I am therefore satisfied that they would have filed an appeal within the statutory delays. The appellants did file the application for extension of time on or about June 14, 1993. In addition, I am satisfied that the appellants believe their trademark "Toys 'R' Us" is sufficiently valuable that they would have appealed the Registrar's decision within the two months delay.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  The main issue before me is to determine whether, on the evidence filed with the present application the appellants have shown that they have an arguable case. I am not called upon to determine the appeal, only to see if the appellants have shown that they have an arguable case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  I immediately state that I am satisfied, from having read the affidavit of Jeffrey Sarfin dated June 11, 1993 that the appeal that the appellants wish to file is neither frivolous nor vexatious.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  Both counsel for the appellants and the respondent made lengthy submissions relating to the issue of whether the appellants have shown that they have an arguable case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  After reading the affidavit of Jeffrey Sarfin dated June 11, 1993, and particularly paras. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, wherein it appears that Toys "R" Us retail stores did sell, under its trademark "Toys 'R' Us", candy, confectionary and snack foods, I am satisfied that with this "new" evidence the appellants have shown an arguable case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  As I have stated, the appellants must only show an arguable case. I am satisfied that they have. I do not believe it necessary for the purposes of this application to go further into the merits of the issues of the appeal as I do not wish to influence the judge who may hear this appeal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  I am, for the above stated reasons, satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the appellants be granted an extension of time to file an appeal, pursuant to s. 56(1) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 , in that, I am satisfied that it was the appellants' intention to appeal the decision, that they could not have done so before the date that it was done (the application for extension of time) and that they have convinced me that they have an arguable case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  I am also satisfied, after reading the affidavit of Neville Rodricks sworn to on July 9, 1993, that the respondent, by my allowing the appeal to proceed will not suffer a serious prejudice. The appeal is part of the opposition process. The respondent may continue to market its product under the "Nuts 'R' Us" trademark. I understand that the respondent may, by doing so, build up goodwill and may, at a later date, be forced to stop selling under the "Nuts 'R' Us" mark. Nevertheless, I am satisfied from the evidence that it would be the appellants who would suffer the greater prejudice if they were not permitted to appeal the Registrar's decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [38] 
  There is no doubt that the respondent Manjel, because of the late filing of the appellants' appeal, has incurred extra costs to contest the application for extension of time. Respondent should not have to pay his counsel for the possible fault of the appellants' trademark agents. I therefore order the appellants to pay as costs, forthwith, the sum of $2,000 plus disbursements incurred in the contestation of the present application. The disbursements are to include the actual cost of air fare for respondent's counsel from Toronto to Montreal and return.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Summary: 
 
 The Convention Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected the claimant's claim for Convention refugee status. On July 7, 1992, the claimant was granted leave to appeal the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal. On February 1, 1993, the Act to Amend the Immigration Act came into force. As a result, all immigration appeals which had not been scheduled for hearing were deemed to be an application for judicial review under s. 18.1 of the Federal Court Act. As the claimant's appeal had not been set down, the Chief Justice transferred the matter to the Trial Division under s. 118 of the amending Act. The claimant applied for an order that the transitional provisions of the amending Act violated s. 7 of the Charter because they eliminated his right to appeal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, dismissed his application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Jerome, A.C.J. 
 : The applicant seeks an order that the transitional provisions of  
 An Act to Amend the Immigration Act and other Acts in consequence thereof 
 , S.C. 1992, c. 49, are constitutionally invalid on the grounds they violate s. 7 of the  
 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
 . On October 28, 1993, I signed an order joining this application on the constitutional question only with applications in files numbered A-465-92, A-1014-92, A-1076-92, A-987-92, A-748-92, A-1189-92, A-956-92, A-881-92, A-1364-92 and A-412-92 and these reasons will therefore apply to those files as well.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  On August 21, 1991, the applicant made a claim for Convention refugee status. His claim was heard by the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board on February 27, 1992. By decision dated March 24, 1992, the Refugee Division held the applicant was not a Convention refugee. An application for leave to appeal the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal was filed on April 8, 1992, in accordance with s. 82.3(1) of the  
 Immigration Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2. Leave to appeal was granted by the Federal Court of Appeal on July 7, 1992, and a notice of appeal was filed on July 9, 1992. The appeal was perfected by August 24, 1992, although the matter remained to be set down for hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Pursuant to s. 52(c) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, the Court of Appeal had the discretion to either dismiss the appeal, give the decision the Refugee Division should have given, or refer the matter back to the tribunal for determination in accordance with such directions as the court considered appropriate.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  However, on February 1, 1993,  
 An Act to Amend the Immigration Act and other Acts in consequence thereof 
  came into force. Section 73 of that  
 Act 
  repealed ss. 82.1 to 84.2 of the former  
 Immigration Act 
  and substituted the following provisions:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "82.1(1) An application for judicial review under the Federal Court Act with respect to any decision or order made, or any matter arising, under this Act or the rules or regulations thereunder may be commenced only with leave of a judge of the Federal Court - Trial Division.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(3) An application under this section for leave to commence an application for judicial review shall be filed with the Federal Court - Trial Division and served within 15 days after the day on which the applicant is notified of the decision or order or becomes aware of the other matter.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(6) Subject to subs. (7), where leave to commence an application for judicial review is granted, the application for judicial review shall be deemed to have been commenced and the judge granting leave shall fix the day and place for the hearing of the application for judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(7) In fixing a day pursuant to subs. (6), the judge shall set the matter down for a day that is no sooner than 30 days, and no later than 90 days, after the day on which leave to commence the application for judicial review was granted, unless the parties agree that the matter may be set down on an earlier day.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(8) Any application for leave to commence an application for judicial review, and any application for judicial review, under this section shall be determined without delay and in a summary way. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [5] 
  In addition, s. 116 of the  
 Act to Amend the Immigration Act 
  provided:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "116. Any application for judicial review and any appeal that was commenced pursuant to s. 82.1, 82.3 or 83, as the case may be, of the Immigration Act, as that section read immediately before the coming into force of s. 73 of this Act, and that had not been set down for hearing before that date, shall be heard by the Federal Court - Trial Division in accordance with ss. 82.1 and 84 of that Act, as enacted by s. 73 of this Act, and all such appeals shall be deemed to be applications for judicial review. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [6] 
  The effect of these provisions was to unify judicial review procedures with respect to immigration matters by deeming all immigration appeals, including those before the Court of Appeal which had not been scheduled for hearing, to be applications for judicial review before the Trial Division under s. 18.1 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 . As the applicant's appeal before the Federal Court of Appeal had not been set down for hearing, the Chief Justice, in accordance with s. 118 of the  
 Act to Amend the Immigration Act 
 , issued a direction transferring the matter to the Trial Division.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  The applicant now submits the transitional provisions infringe his rights under s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
  because they eliminate his right to an appeal and therefore the possible remedy of having the Court of Appeal give the decision the Refugee Division should have given, namely that he is a Convention refugee. As this remedy is not available on judicial review, it is argued the transitional provisions of the  
 Act to Amend the Immigration Act 
  retrospectively deprive him of his right to life, liberty and security of the person in a manner which is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The respondent maintains the transitional provisions do not infringe the applicant's s. 7 rights since the principles of fundamental justice referred to therein do not include a right of appeal. Judicial review, it is argued, rather than infringing the applicant's rights under the  
 Charter 
 , serves to protect those rights in a manner which is consistent with the principles of fundamental justice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  There are two preliminary issues. First, the applicant contends that the provisions are substantive in nature and relies on the common law presumptions against the retrospective operation of substantive legislation and interference with vested rights. The respondent maintains the provisions operate prospectively to alter the statutory scheme governing the applicant's redress to the courts and accordingly, the presumptions against retrospectivity do not apply.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  In my view, any common law presumptions against interference with vested rights and the retrospective operation of legislation are answered in this case by the clear and unequivocal language of the statute. The express wording of the transitional provisions, in particular s. 116, deems all appeals to be judicial review applications and the grounds of review set out in s. 18.1 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  are to apply.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  The applicant also claims that the transitional provisions will cause unreasonable delay in the determination of his claim thereby infringing his s. 7 rights under the  
 Charter 
 , but no evidence was presented to support it. Furthermore, although s. 52(c)(i) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  allows the Court of Appeal to give the decision an administrative tribunal should have given, that remedy is entirely discretionary. The court also has the discretion to refer the matter back to the tribunal for rehearing and redetermination in accordance with such directions as it considers appropriate. Accordingly, the applicant may well have been awarded the same remedy on appeal as he will receive on judicial review and any arguments with respect to delay are speculative.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  The Supreme Court of Canada in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 422; 14 C.R.R. 13; 12 Admin. L.R. 137, directs that the question now before the court should be approached in three stages. First, whether refugee claimants physically present in Canada are entitled to the protection of s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
 . Second, whether the impugned legislative provisions, in this case the transitional provisions in  
 An Act to Amend the Immigration Act 
 , deny a refugee claimant's rights under s. 7. Third, whether the limitations imposed on the applicant's rights are justified within the meaning of s. 1 of the  
 Charter 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  Since the decision in  
 Singh 
 , there is no longer any question that refugee claimants are entitled to fundamental justice in the determination of whether they are Convention refugees. As stated by Madame Justice Wilson in  
 Singh 
  at pp. 460 and 464 [D.L.R.]:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "It must be recognized that the appellants are not at this stage entitled to assert rights as Convention refugees; their claim is that they are entitled to fundamental justice in the determination of whether they are Convention refugees or not.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In summary, I am of the view that the rights which the appellants are seeking to assert are ones which entitle them to the protection of s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
 . <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [14] 
  The next question which this court must determine is whether the principles of fundamental justice are denied by the procedures set out in the impugned transitional provisions. In  
 Singh 
 , Madame Justice Wilson stated at p. 464:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "All counsel were agreed that at a minimum the concept of 'fundamental justice' as it appears in s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
  includes the notion of procedural fairness articulated by Fauteux, C.J.C., in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . At p. 134 D.L.R., p. 923 S.C.R., he said:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 'Under s. 2(e) of the  
 Bill of Rights 
  no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to deprive him of a "fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice". Without attempting to formulate any final definition of those words, I would take them to mean, generally, that the tribunal which adjudicates upon his rights must act fairly, in good faith, without bias and in a judicial temper, and must give to him the opportunity adequately to state his case.'  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Do the procedures set out in the  
 Act 
  for the adjudication of refugee status claims meet this test of procedural fairness? Do they provide an adequate opportunity for a refugee claimant to state his case and know the case he has to meet? This seems to be the question we have to answer ... 
 " (Emphasis added)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Applying those principles to the facts before me, I am unable to conclude the transitional provisions, by deeming appeals to be judicial review applications, deny the applicant the fundamental justice to which he is entitled under s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
 . There is no support for the proposition that the principles of fundamental justice include a right of appeal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.C.C.(3d) 453; 70 C.R.(3d) 383, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the question of whether the  
 Charter 
  afforded a right of appeal from a decision of a judge to review various wiretap authorizations when no such right was provided for in the  
 Criminal Code 
 . McIntyre, J., stated at p. 460-461 [C.C.C.]:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The argument in support of this ground, simply put, is that the rights protected or guaranteed in the  
 Charter 
  are of such significance that an appeal should be available where relief under the  
 Charter 
  is denied at first instance. In short, what is asserted is that the  
 Charter 
  makes obligatory a right of appeal from any legal proceeding at first instance.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "At common law there were no appeals. All appeals have been the creature of statute ... Therefore, if any such specific right exists it must be found in the  
 Charter 
 . The question facing the court then is: Does the  
 Charter 
 , because of the importance of the interests it protects, provide an appeal against a refusal of a Wilson application for review despite the fact that neither the  
 Criminal Code 
  nor any other legislative enactment so provides? ...  
 I would say at the outset that in my view the  
 Charter 
  does not provide such an appeal. 
 " (Emphasis added)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Furthermore, I am satisfied the applicant's rights under s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
  are well protected by the judicial review procedures set out in the  
 Federal Court Act 
 . Section 18.1(3) and (4) of the  
 Act 
  provide as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "18.1(3) On an application for judicial review, the Trial Division may  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) order a federal board, commission or other tribunal to do any act or thing it has unlawfully failed or refused to do or has unreasonably delayed in doing; or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) declare invalid or unlawful, or quash, set aside or set aside and refer back for determination in accordance with such directions as it considers to be appropriate, prohibit or restrain, a decision, order, act or proceeding of a federal board, commission or other tribunal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(4) The Trial Division may grant relief under subs. (3) if it is satisfied that the federal board, commission or other tribunal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) acted without jurisdiction, acted beyond its jurisdiction or refused to exercise its jurisdiction;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) failed to observe a principle of natural justice, procedural fairness or other procedure that it was required by law to observe;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) erred in law in making its decision or an order, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (e) acted, or failed to act, by reason of fraud or perjured evidence; or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (f) acted in any other way that was contrary to law. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [17] 
  Clearly, the grounds for judicial review in s. 18.1 are quite extensive. Rather than infringing a refugee claimant's s. 7 rights, it seems to me the procedure of judicial review to which refugee claimants are entitled under the impugned transitional provisions safeguard those rights, in a manner entirely consistent with the principles of fundamental justice. The applicant's right to have his Convention refugee status determined by a tribunal acting fairly, in good faith, without bias and in a judicial temper, as well as his right to have an opportunity to adequately state his case, are not adversely affected in any way.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  For these reasons, I am satisfied the transitional provisions in  
 An Act to Amend the Immigration Act 
 , in particular ss. 73 and 116, do not infringe the applicant's rights under s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
  and are therefore constitutionally valid enactments. The application is therefore dismissed. No order as to costs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

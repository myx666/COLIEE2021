 I. Introduction  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] 
   
 Snider, J. 
 : The Applicant is a citizen of Sri Lanka, of Tamil ancestry, who arrived in Canada in 2010 as one of 492 passengers on the  
 M/V Sun Sea 
 . He denies any involvement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which is designated as a terrorist organization in Canada. Nevertheless he claims refugee protection in Canada on the basis that he is at risk of persecution because he will be perceived to be associated with the LTTE since he arrived on the  
 M/V Sun Sea 
 . Moreover, he claims that he is at risk from the Sri Lankan authorities who will undoubtedly persecute him as a returning refugee claimant who travelled on the  
 M/V Sun Sea 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  In a decision dated June 12, 2012, a panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division (the Board) denied the Applicant's claim for protection under s. 96 and ss. 97(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 ( 
 IRPA 
 ). The Board accepted that the Applicant had no ties to the LTTE and made a number of other key findings:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • The Applicant could relocate to Jaffna, an internal flight alternative, and live safely there;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • The Applicant would not face persecution as a returning failed Tamil asylum seeker; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • The Applicant is not likely to be at risk on the basis of perceived association with the LTTE as a result of his coming to Canada on the  
 M/V Sun Sea 
  (the  
 sur place 
  claim).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II. Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The Applicant seeks to overturn this decision, raising the following issues:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Did the Board err by failing to consider central, relevant and probative evidence relating to the Applicant's  
 sur place 
  claim?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Was the Board's  
 sur place 
  analysis unreasonable because it was based on incorrect information, assumptions unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable speculation?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the decision should stand.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III. Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  The standard of review applicable to the decision is that of reasonableness. The role of the court when a reasonableness standard is appropriate is to determine "whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law" ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ 
 Dunsmuir 
 ]). A court should also examine whether the decision displays "justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process" ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV. Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 A. Issue #1: Failure to consider evidence  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The court may presume that the RPD has considered all the evidence, and the Board is not required to specifically refer to each piece of evidence presented ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 153;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4th) 606). However, the RPD may commit a reviewable error by failing to specify central evidence to the applicant's claim which contradicts its reasoning or conclusion ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (TD)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  In the context of a record in which there are multiple items of documentary evidence relating to country conditions, the Board does not have to refer to every single document. Nonetheless, if the Board fails to mention the substantive content of critical evidence that contradicts its findings, then it has erred ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 36).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The Applicant asserts that the Board ignored an article written in early 2012, posted on the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence website, relating primarily to an organization called the Canadian Tamil Congress (Certified Tribunal Record (CTR) at 1510-1512). This article alleges that the CTC is a front for the LTTE, seeking to advance the LTTE's goals through human rights efforts. The relevant passage states as follows (CTR, Vol 8 at 1511):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The ongoing investigations reveal the CTC facilitated the multi-million dollar LTTE run human smuggling operations by MV Ocean Lady (76 crew and passengers) and MV Sun Sea (492 crew and passengers). Spearheaded by two former Sea Tigers, Ravishankar Kanagarajah of Canada and Shanmugasundaram Kanthaskaran of the UK, the LTTE also facilitated the passage of over 200 LTTE leaders, members and their families to Canada ... Further, it is revealed that, not only did the CTC provide legal and financial aid to the LTTE crew and passengers but also projected that they were bona fide refugees and not terrorists. As the key LTTE cadres and their families arrived in Vancouver, the very next day Poopalapillai [CTC's Director of Public Relations] with his team flew to Vancouver to defend the LTTE infiltrators and counter Canadian efforts to develop tough legislation. Gary Anandasangaree of CTC provided legal counsel.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  In the case before me, the Board acknowledges the substance of this evidence. The Board states that "[t]here is no doubt that the arrival of the M/V Sun Sea generated significant interest on the part of the public and government authorities in both Sri Lanka and here in Canada" (Decision at paragraph 74). The RPD further explained that "concerns were expressed by Canadian and Sri Lankan officials as to the backgrounds and reasons why the M/V Sun Sea migrants arrived on Canadian shores" (Decision at paragraph 71).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Similarly, the Board cites other articles raised by counsel relating to LTTE connections of certain  
 M/V Sun Sea 
  passengers. One article, dated March 6, 2012 and published by the Presidential Secretariat of Sri Lanka, explains that an  
 M/V Sun Sea 
  passenger admitted to working for LTTE prior to his arrival in Canada, and notes that 15 other passengers are alleged LTTE members (Decision at paragraph 68 referring to CTR Vol 8 at 1525). The second article is dated 2011 and was posted to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence website. This article explains that one of the  
 M/V Sun Sea 
  migrants admitted to membership in the LTTE (Decision at paragraph 68 referring to CTR Vol 4 at 658).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  In sum, I am not persuaded that the Board ignored the specific documents. The substance of those documents was considered and is not inconsistent with the Board's findings. This evidence demonstrates, at the very most, that the  
 M/V Sun Sea 
  is associated with the LTTE and some, but not all, passengers may be LTTE members or have LTTE connections. However, the question is whether, on the totality of the evidence, it was reasonable for the Board to conclude that the Applicant himself would not be at risk because of perceived links to the LTTE. As discussed below, the Board reasonably concluded that this Applicant would  
 not 
  be perceived as LTTE upon his return to Sri Lanka. The fact that particular documents were not referred to does not affect the outcome of this case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 B. Issue #2: Unreasonable sur place finding  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  The Applicant presented to the Board (and to this Court), the following line of reasoning supporting a conclusion that the Applicant would face more than a mere possibility of persecution upon his return to Sri Lanka:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. The evidence before the Board demonstrates clearly that agents of the government of Sri Lanka engage in a systemic use of torture as a means of securing information or confessions from detainees.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. All returning Tamils who were on the  
 M/V Sun Sea 
  will be subjected to interrogation to determine whether they might have LTTE associations or information related to those LTTE members who were responsible for this people smuggling operation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. It follows that there is more than a mere possibility that the Applicant will be subject to systemic torture upon his return.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The flaw in the Applicant's argument arises with his third step. The Board acknowledged the human rights abuses of the Sri Lanka government and accepted that the Applicant would be detained and questioned upon his return. However, the Board refused to conclude that there was a serious possibility that  
 this particular Applicant 
  would be subjected to torture upon his return. The Board reasoned that, taking into account the specific circumstances of the Applicant, the Sri Lankan authorities were not likely to conclude that he was associated with the LTTE . Thus, there was not more than a mere possibility that he would have a lengthy detention with the risk of torture.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  The question is whether there was evidence before the Board upon which such a determination could be reached. In my view, there was. For example, the Board had before it - and referred to - the fate of other returning failed asylum seekers. The Board observed that, in spite of two investigations into the background of the Applicant, Sri Lankan officials "have reassured themselves that the [Applicant] has no LTTE ties" (Decision at paragraph 33) and "were of the opinion that he presented no risk to the peace and stability of their country" (Decision at paragraph 35). The Board also referred to the uncontested fact that the Applicant had been cleared by Canadian officials of LTTE association after interviews with the Canadian Border Services Agency which, the Board logically assumed, would be known to the Sri Lankan officials. Further, the Board considered and explained why it did not give weight to certain general statements made to the effect that "any Sri Lankan who fled the country in an unauthorized way must be a LTTE sympathizer" (Decision at paragraph 70).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The Applicant submits that the Board erred in its assumption that the decision of the Board would be persuasive evidence to the Sri Lankan authorities that he is not LTTE. In this argument, the Applicant fails to appreciate the entire context in which reference is made to the Canadian decision. The Board's suggestion that the Applicant show his Board decision to the Sri Lankan authorities is not unreasonable in the context of the decision as a whole. As assumed by the Board and by the Applicant, the Sri Lankan authorities would know that the Applicant travelled to Canada on the  
 M/V Sun Sea 
 , and would logically conclude that he applied for refugee protection. Therefore, theoretically speaking, the Board decision could not place him at greater risk and could be helpful in demonstrating why the Canadian authorities believed that the Applicant is not a member of the LTTE. Although there is no evidence that the Board decision would necessarily be probative to the Sri Lankan authorities, the Board acknowledges that the Sri Lankan government will conduct its own independent evaluation and this is phrased merely as an option.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  In support of his argument, the Applicant provided me with a number of Board decisions in which different panel members of the Board accepted  
 M/V Sun Sea 
  claimants as Convention refugees, allegedly following the Applicant's proposed line of reasoning. The problem is that these Board decisions do not have precedential value - for very good reason. The individual facts and records in each case must be examined. For example, in one of the cases referred to, the panel concluded that the claimant's profile was one suspected of having links with the LTTE, thereby exacerbating the risk on his return.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Moreover, and more importantly, the decision is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness. It is possible for different conclusions to be reached on similar facts. I acknowledge that the Applicant put forward a rational line of reasoning for finding that the Applicant was at risk because of his passage on the  
 M/V Sun Sea 
 . However, that does not mean that the line of reasoning followed by the Board is unreasonable. The existence of a range of possible outcomes is the hallmark of the reasonableness standard and is the foundation of the deference owed to decision makers. Whether this Applicant would face more than a mere possibility of persecution is a factual question to be determined by the Board. While I or another panel member might have come to a different conclusion, the decision of this Board was reasonably open to it on this particular evidentiary record. The Court should not intervene.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V. Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  The decision is not unreasonable and should not be overturned.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  Neither party proposes a question for certification.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 La juge Snider 
  [Traduction]: Le demandeur est un citoyen du Sri Lanka d'origine tamoule, qui est arrivé au Canada en 2010 et qui était l'un des 492 passagers à bord du  
 NM Sun Sea 
 . Il nie toute implication au sein des Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (les TLET), un groupe désigné comme une organisation terroriste au Canada. Il demande néanmoins l'asile au Canada au motif qu'il est exposé à un risque de persécution, parce qu'il sera perçu comme une personne liée aux TLET, et ce, en raison du fait qu'il est arrivé au Canada à bord du  
 NM Sun Sea 
 . De plus, il prétend qu'il est exposé à un risque aux mains des autorités sri-lankaises, qui vont sans doute le persécuter en tant que demandeur d'asile qui a voyagé à bord du  
 NM Sun Sea 
  et qui a été tenu de retourner au Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Dans une décision datée du 12 juin 2012, un tribunal de la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la Commission) a rejeté la demande d'asile que le demandeur avait présentée au titre de l'article 96 et du paragraphe 97(1) de la  
 Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés 
 , LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi). La Commission a reconnu que le demandeur n'avait aucun lien avec les TLET et elle a tiré un certain nombre d'autres conclusions clés:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Le demandeur aurait pu déménager à Jaffna, une possibilité de refuge intérieur, et y vivre en toute sécurité;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Le demandeur ne serait pas exposé à un risque de persécution s'il retournait dans son pays en tant que Tamoul dont la demande d'asile a été rejetée;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Il est peu probable que le demandeur soit exposé à un risque fondé sur son association apparente avec les TLET en raison de son arrivée au Canada à bord du  
 NM Sun Sea 
  (la demande d'asile présentée sur place).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II. Les questions en litige  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Le demandeur sollicite l'annulation de cette décision. Il soulève les questions en litige suivantes:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a omis de tenir compte de la preuve essentielle, pertinente et probante relative à demande d'asile présentée sur place par le demandeur?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. L'analyse effectuée par la Commission quant à la demande présentée sur place était-elle déraisonnable, du fait que cette analyse reposait sur des renseignements erronés, sur des hypothèses qui n'étaient pas étayées par la preuve et sur des conjectures déraisonnables?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  J'ai conclu que la décision devrait être confirmée, et ce, pour les motifs qui suivent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III. La norme de contrôle applicable  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  La norme de contrôle applicable à la décision est la raisonnabilité. Lorsque cette norme s'applique, le rôle de la cour de révision est de se demander « si la décision appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 ), au paragraphe 47). La cour de révision doit aussi examiner « la justification de la décision, [...] la transparence et [...] l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel » ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 , précité, au paragraphe 47).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV. Analyse  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 A. La première question en litige: l'omission de tenir compte de la preuve  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  La Cour peut présumer que la SPR a tenu compte de toute la preuve, et la Commission n'a pas l'obligation de renvoyer expressément à chacun des éléments de preuve qui lui ont été présentés ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 153, au paragraphe 8;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4th) 606, au paragraphe 90). Cependant, la SPR peut commettre une erreur susceptible de contrôle si elle omet de mentionner les éléments de preuve essentiels à la demande d'asile du demandeur qui contredisent son raisonnement ou sa conclusion ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1re inst), au paragraphe 11);  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1re inst), aux paragraphes 15 à 17, et 27).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Dans le contexte d'un dossier renfermant de multiples éléments de preuve documentaire concernant la situation dans le pays, la Commission n'a pas à citer chacun de ces documents. Toutefois, la Commission commet une erreur si elle omet de mentionner les éléments essentiels d'une preuve cruciale qui va à l'encontre des conclusions qu'elle tire ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 36, au paragraphe 41).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  Le demandeur affirme que la Commission a fait fi d'un article, écrit au début de l'année 2012 et publié sur le site Web du ministère de la Défense du Sri Lanka, qui portait principalement sur une organisation nommée « Congrès tamoul canadien » (le CTC) (dossier certifié du tribunal (DCT), aux pages 1510 à 1512). On y alléguait que le CTC servait de paravent aux TLET et qu'il visait à promouvoir les objectifs des TLET, par l'entremise d'actions sur le plan des droits de la personne. Le passage pertinent mentionne ce qui suit (DCT, volume 8, à la page 1511):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [traduction]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Les enquêtes en cours révèlent que le CTC a facilité les opérations de plusieurs millions de dollars des TLET visant le passage de clandestins à bord du  
 NM Ocean Lady 
  (76 membres d'équipage et passagers) et du  
 NM Sun Sea 
  (492 membres d'équipage et passagers). Les TLET, qui sont dirigés par deux anciens Tigres des mers, soit Ravishankar Kanagarajah, du Canada, et Shanmugasundaram Kanthaskaran, du Royaume-Uni, ont aussi facilité le passage au Canada de plus de 200 membres et dirigeants des TLET, ainsi que leur famille [...] Les enquêtes révèlent de plus que, non seulement le CTC a bel et bien fourni de l'aide financière et juridique à l'équipage et aux passagers membres des TLET, mais qu'ils les ont aussi présentés comme étant d'authentiques réfugiés, et non comme des terroristes. Lors de l'arrivée de dirigeants importants des TLET et de leur famille à Vancouver, Poopalapillai [le directeur des relations publiques du CTC] et son équipe ont pris, dès le lendemain, l'avion en direction de Vancouver pour prendre la défense des agents des TLET et pour contrer les efforts déployés par le Canada afin d'élaborer une législation sévère. Gary Anandasangaree, du CTC, agissait à titre de conseiller juridique.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  Dans l'affaire dont je suis saisie, la Commission a reconnu le caractère essentiel de cet élément de preuve. La Commission a énoncé que « [n]ul doute que l'arrivée du  
 NM 
   
 Sun Sea 
  [avait] grandement suscité l'intérêt du public et des autorités gouvernementales du Sri Lanka, de même que du Canada » (décision, au paragraphe 74). La SPR a de plus expliqué que « des préoccupations [avaient] été exprimées par les autorités canadiennes et sri-lankaises quant aux antécédents des migrants arrivés au Canada à bord du  
 NM 
   
 Sun Sea 
  et à leurs motifs » (décision, au paragraphe 71).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Dans la même veine, la Commission a cité d'autres articles que le conseil avait invoqués, lesquels concernaient les liens de certains passagers du  
 NM 
   
 Sun Sea 
  avec les TLET. Un des articles, daté du 6 mars 2012 et publié par le Secrétariat présidentiel du Sri Lanka, expliquait qu'un des passagers du  
 NM 
   
 Sun Sea 
  avait admis avoir travaillé pour le compte des TLET avant son arrivée au Canada, et mentionnait que 15 autres passagers étaient des membres prétendus des TLET (décision, au paragraphe 68, qui renvoyait au DCT, volume 8, à la page 1525). Le deuxième article, qui remontait à 2011, avait été publié sur le ministère de la Défense du Sri Lanka. Cet article expliquait que l'un des migrants du  
 NM 
   
 Sun Sea 
  avait reconnu faire partie des TLET (décision, au paragraphe 68, qui renvoyait au DCT, volume 4, à la page 658).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  En résumé, je ne suis pas convaincue que la Commission a fait fi des documents en question. On a examiné l'essentiel de ces documents, et ce n'était pas incompatible avec les conclusions de la Commission. Cette preuve démontre, tout au plus, que le  
 NM 
   
 Sun Sea 
  était associé aux TLET et que certains des passagers, mais pas tous, pouvaient faire partie des TLET ou avoir des liens avec cette organisation. Cependant, la question est de savoir si, au vu de la totalité de la preuve, il était raisonnable pour la Commission de conclure que le demandeur lui-même ne serait pas exposé à un risque en raison de liens perçus avec les TLET. Comme je l'explique plus loin, la Commission a raisonnablement conclu que le demandeur dans la présente affaire  
 ne 
  serait  
 pas 
  perçu comme quelqu'un faisant partie des TLET à son retour au Sri Lanka. Le fait qu'elle n'ait pas renvoyé à certains documents en particulier n'a aucune incidence quant à l'issue de la présente affaire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 B. La deuxième question en litige: la conclusion déraisonnable quant à la demande présentée sur place  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  Le demandeur a présenté à la Commission (et à la Cour) le raisonnement suivant à l'appui d'une conclusion selon laquelle il serait exposé à plus qu'une simple possibilité d'être persécuté à son retour au Sri Lanka:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. La preuve dont disposait la Commission démontrait clairement que les représentants du gouvernement du Sri Lanka avaient systématiquement recours à la torture des détenus pour obtenir des informations ou des aveux.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Tous les Tamouls qui étaient à bord du  
 NM 
   
 Sun Sea 
  et qui seront renvoyés au Sri Lanka seront soumis à un interrogatoire pour établir s'ils pourraient avoir des liens avec les TLET ou des renseignements liés aux membres des TLET qui étaient responsables de cette opération de passage de clandestins.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. Par conséquent, il existe plus qu'une simple possibilité qu'il soit exposé à la torture systémique à son retour au Sri Lanka.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  La faille dans l'argumentation du demandeur découle de sa troisième étape. La Commission a reconnu les violations des droits de la personne de la part du gouvernement du Sri Lanka, et le fait que le demandeur serait détenu et interrogé à son retour. Cependant, la Commission a refusé de conclure qu'il existait une possibilité sérieuse que  
 le demandeur en l'espèce 
  soit exposé à un risque de torture à son retour au Sri Lanka. La Commission a conclu que, étant donné les circonstances propres au demandeur, les autorités du Sri Lanka ne concluraient probablement pas qu'il était lié aux TLET. Par conséquent, il n'y avait pas plus qu'une simple possibilité qu'il soit détenu pendant une longue période et qu'il soit exposé à un risque de torture.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  La question est de savoir si la Commission disposait d'une preuve lui permettant de tirer cette conclusion. Je suis d'avis que c'était le cas. À titre d'exemple, on avait présenté à la Commission une preuve concernant le sort des autres demandeurs d'asile déboutés renvoyés dans leur pays, et elle en a fait mention. La Commission a signalé que, malgré deux enquêtes concernant les antécédents du demandeur, les autorités du Sri Lanka « s'étaient assuré[es] que le demandeur [...] n'avait aucun lien avec les TLET » (décision, au paragraphe 33) et qu'elles « étaient d'avis qu'il ne présentait aucun risque pour la paix et la stabilité de leur pays » (décision, au paragraphe 35). La Commission a aussi mentionné le fait, non contesté, que les autorités canadiennes avaient conclu, en se fondant sur les entrevues conduites par l'Agence canadienne des services frontaliers, que le demandeur n'avait aucun lien avec les TLET. La Commission a logiquement tenu pour acquis que ce fait allait être connu des autorités sri-lankaises. De plus, la Commission a examiné certaines déclarations générales portant que « tout Sri-Lankais ayant fui le pays de façon irrégulière doit être un partisan des TLET » (décision, au paragraphe 70) et elle a expliqué pourquoi elle n'y attribuait pas de poids.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Le demandeur soutient que la Commission a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a formulé l'hypothèse que sa décision constituerait, pour les autorités sri-lankaises, une preuve convaincante qu'il ne faisait pas partie des TLET. Ce faisant, il omet de tenir compte de l'ensemble du contexte dans lequel on fait référence à la décision canadienne. La suggestion, formulée par la Commission, que le demandeur montre la décision de la Commission le concernant aux autorités sri-lankaises n'était pas déraisonnable dans le contexte de la décision dans son ensemble. Comme l'ont supposé la Commission et le demandeur, les autorités sri-lankaises allaient savoir que le demandeur s'était rendu au Canada à bord du  
 NM 
   
 Sun Sea 
 , et elles allaient logiquement conclure qu'il avait demandé l'asile. Donc, en théorie, la décision de la Commission ne pouvait l'exposer davantage à un risque et elle pourrait être utile pour démontrer pourquoi les autorités canadiennes croyaient que le demandeur ne faisait pas partie des TLET. Bien qu'il n'y ait pas de preuve que la décision de la Commission aura nécessairement une force probante auprès des autorités sri-lankaises, la Commission a reconnu que le gouvernement du Sri Lanka allait conduire sa propre enquête indépendante, et que cette hypothèse n'était formulée qu'à titre de possibilité.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Pour étayer sa prétention, le demandeur m'a fourni un certain nombre de décisions de la Commission, dans lesquelles différents commissaires avaient conclu, en adoptant, allègue-t-il, le raisonnement qu'il propose, que les demandeurs d'asile à bord du  
 NM 
   
 Sun Sea 
  étaient des réfugiés au sens de la Convention. Le problème réside dans le fait que ces décisions de la Commission n'ont pas valeur de précédent, et ce, pour une excellente raison. Chaque affaire doit être examinée selon la situation qui lui est propre. Par exemple, dans l'une des affaires invoquées par le demandeur, le tribunal avait conclu que le demandeur d'asile avait le profil d'une personne soupçonnée d'avoir les liens avec les TLET, ce qui exacerbait le risque auquel il aurait été exposé à son retour.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  En outre, et il s'agit d'un facteur encore plus important, la décision est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la raisonnabilité. Il est possible de parvenir à des conclusions différentes à partir de faits similaires. Je reconnais que le demandeur a mis de l'avant un raisonnement logique à l'appui de la conclusion qu'il était exposé à un risque, en raison de son arrivée au pays à bord du  
 NM 
   
 Sun Sea 
 . Cela ne signifie toutefois pas que le raisonnement adopté par la Commission était déraisonnable. L'existence d'un éventail d'issues possibles est la caractéristique principale de la norme de la raisonnabilité et elle constitue la fondation de la déférence envers les décideurs. La question de savoir si le demandeur en l'espèce serait exposé à plus qu'une simple possibilité de persécution était une question factuelle qui relevait de la Commission. Malgré le fait qu'il soit possible que moi, ou qu'un autre commissaire, ayons pu parvenir à une conclusion différente, il était raisonnablement loisible à ce tribunal de la Commission d'en arriver à cette décision, au vu du dossier de preuve en l'espèce. La Cour ne devrait pas intervenir.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V. Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  La décision n'est pas déraisonnable et elle ne devrait pas être annulée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

Boivin, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act), of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the panel) dated September 16, 2009, according to which the applicant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection under the Act.
Facts
[2]
The applicant is a citizen of Mexico who alleges a fear of persecution by a group of Federal Judicial Police officers from Colonia Paraje San Juan, where he lives.
[3]
On December 19, 2006, two Federal Judicial Police officers allegedly beat Francisco Javier Davalos Aguilar, a friend of the applicant, threatening to harm him if he did not go to work with a group involved in the theft of cars and car parts. The applicant and his friend filed a complaint with the public prosecutor that same day.
[4]
On January 8, 2007, the applicant filed a second complaint and was arrested by a Federal Judicial Police patrol. The applicant received medical attention at a medical clinic. The doctor who treated him, Dr. Medrano, told him that he had to report the incident to the authorities, or she would. When the applicant came home, his mother told him to register a complaint with the public prosecutor in Ixtapalapa for his illegal detention, but he did not receive a copy of that charge.
[5]
After consulting with a lawyer, the applicant made a complaint to the authorities on January 9, 2007, but the officials would not listen to him and said that they wanted witnesses. On February 18, 2007, the applicant filed another complaint with the public prosecutor, but he was told that he could not do so because the incident involved his uncle, who was the one who needed to file the complaint.
[6]
The applicant went to Guadalajara, Jalisco, to the house of his friend Carlos Alberto, because he did not want to leave his country and his mother. The applicant's lawyer then informed him that he had been unable to obtain copies of his complaints and that the complaints were inactive.
[7]
On May 20, 2007, the applicant went out with his friend Carlos Alberto. A white car followed them, and the applicant recognized one of the policemen involved in the car theft operation in the neighbourhood. The applicant then fled to Morelos, Mochoacán, on May 21, 2007.
[8]
The applicant left Mexico on June 12, 2007. He made a claim for refugee protection in Canada the day after he arrived.
Impugned decision
[9]
The panel first determined that the applicant was not credible, for he had produced no evidence corroborating the essential elements of his narrative and had no reasonable explanation for his failure to do so. The panel rejected the applicant's explanations about his efforts to obtain the documents, which were contradictory.
[10]
In addition, the panel concluded that, even if he had been found to be credible, the applicant failed to demonstrate through clear and convincing evidence that the state was unwilling or unable to offer him protection. In the panel's the opinion, the applicant had gone to the authorities but had not exhausted all courses of action open to him. After reviewing the documentary evidence, the panel determined that the applicant could have gone to other authorities in place  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that deal with police corruption problems.
Issues
[11]
This application for judicial review raises the following issues:
1. Did the panel err in finding that the applicant was not credible?
2. Did the panel err in determining that the applicant did have access to state protection  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ?
Analysis
Standard of review
[12]
Evaluating credibility and weighing evidence falls within the jurisdiction of the tribunal assessing a refugee protection claimant's allegation of a subjective fear (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicable standard of review under such circumstances was patent unreasonableness; it is now reasonableness.
[13]
The applicable standard of review for questions of state protection is reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras. 55, 57, 62 and 64;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 1 at para. 38;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 968 at para. 14).
1. Did the panel err in finding that the applicant was not credible?
[14]
It is well established that issues of credibility, assessment of facts and appreciation of evidence are wholly within the discretion of the panel, as the trier of fact (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 118;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 1228), and it is not for the Court to substitute its assessment of the evidence for that of the panel.
[15]
The applicant submits that the panel failed to assess the documentary evidence carefully and consider the fact that Mexican police have problems with corruption.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 783, this Court noted that the obligation to comment on documentary evidence in a decision depends on the importance of that evidence. Here, the applicant alleges that the documentary evidence that was ignored dealt with facts essential to the applicant's claim, rendering the panel's decision unreasonable.
[16]
However, the Court notes that the panel found several omissions and inconsistencies in the applicant's testimony, namely the following:
a. During the incident of December 19, 2006, the applicant stated that he and his friend Francisco had signed a complaint and had asked for a copy but that the authorities had refused to provide them with one. The applicant did not include this information in his Personal Information Form (PIF), believing it to be an unimportant detail. He later admitted, however, that it was important information.
b. The applicant first denied having asked his lawyer to obtain copies of his complaints and then said that he had asked his mother for copies. Later, he stated that his lawyer charged between 8,000 and 9,000 pesos for obtaining a copy of the complaints and refused to help him. This was not mentioned in the applicant's PIF. The applicant then asked his mother to find another lawyer, which she did in April 2008, but this second lawyer also charged between 7,000 and 8,000 pesos. This information is not in the PIF, and, according to the applicant, his lawyer refused to send him a letter confirming the incidents  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for fear of having problems with Mexican police or Canadian authorities.
c. The applicant stated that his mother had tried to get a copy of his medical report and that he had also made a number of telephone calls to try to obtain it. This information was also not in his PIF, and the applicant was unable to explain this omission. More specifically, the panel referred to the documentary evidence, in particular document MEX102725.E dated April 17, 2008, entitled "Police reports; procedures to obtain a copy from the various police forces; the cost; the persons who can obtain a copy; the time it takes to obtain a copy; the possibility of obtaining a copy from Canada", showing that the applicant in this case could have obtained copies of police reports by writing directly to the authorities or with the help of a lawyer.
[17]
Even though the applicant alleged a fear of persecution by a group of Federal Judicial Police agents in Colonia Paraje San Juan, no concrete evidence was filed in support of this element. In addition, the Court is of the opinion that the applicant provided no reasonable explanation as to why he failed to produce evidence corroborating the complaints he claims to have filed with the authorities.
[18]
On this basis, it was open to the panel to draw a negative inference, first, regarding the applicant's credibility, because of the lack of corroborating evidence and, second, because of the lack of reasonable and credible explanations for his failure to produce that evidence. It is trite law that the panel may make adverse findings based on the fact that applicants failed to produce evidence corroborating their testimony or make any efforts to obtain such corroborating documentation (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 809, and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 725).
[19]
The panel is in the best position to assess the explanations submitted by applicants for any perceived inconsistencies and implausibilities, and the role of this Court is not to substitute its judgment for the panel's on findings of fact relating to the applicant's credibility (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 325 at para. 36;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)). Here, the applicant's explanations for the lack of evidence corroborating his narrative are not reasonable.
[20]
Overall, I am of the opinion that the applicant in this case did not demonstrate that the panel based its decision on erroneous findings of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the evidence.
2. Did the panel err in determining that the applicant did have access to state protection  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ?
[21]
The applicant submits that, in its analysis of the availability of state protection, the panel failed to consider the information on Mexico showing that the country is grappling with unequalled, rampant corruption.
[22]
The respondent notes that the onus is on the applicant to provide clear and convincing evidence of the state of Mexico's inability to protect him (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It is not enough for the applicant merely to show that state protection was not perfect, as no government that adheres to democratic values or makes any claim to protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times (
Canada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 1259 (F.C.A.)).
[23]
The panel considered the applicant's allegations that he approached Mexican authorities for protection. Several decisions of this Court have determined that Mexico is able to protect its citizens, despite problems with corruption and even when the agents of persecution are police officers (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 694 at para. 18;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 705 at para. 10).
[24]
The panel also noted that the applicant never sought protection from higher authorities  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In light of the documentary evidence showing that efforts are being made to fight police corruption and that there are other organizations that the applicant could have turned to, it was reasonable for the panel to reject the applicant's explanation that fear prevented him from approaching higher authorities. As counsel for the respondent pointed out at the hearing, the applicant had to exhaust all courses of action open to him in his country, which he did not do. Given that the evidence on file shows that there are other agencies with which the applicant could have filed his complaint, it was reasonable to expect the applicant to make some effort to use other measures before seeking international protection.
[25]
In its decision, the panel recognized that there have been many actions taken against corrupt officials involved in illegal activities throughout the years. The June 29, 2009, National Documentation Package, at section 7.1,
Narcotics Control Strategy Report
from the United States, describes President Calderon's efforts to fight drug traffickers and police corruption. There are also other resources such as the Secretariat of Public Administration, which offers various services to citizens wishing to report acts of corruption.
[26]
In spite of this, the applicant claimed that fear prevented him from going to the federal authorities. This explanation cannot be accepted, for the adequacy of state protection cannot rest on the subjective fear of an applicant. The presumption of state protection cannot be rebutted on this subjective basis alone ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> v
.
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
), 2005 FC 1050, 141 A.C.W.S. (3d) 116).
[27]
To rebut the presumption of state protection, an applicant must present clear and convincing proof of the state's inability to protect. The evidence must be relevant and reliable, and convince the trier of fact that the state protection is inadequate (
Ward
;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[28]
State protection does not need to be perfect, as no government can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times; it merely needs to be adequate (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 191;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 904).
[29]
When the state is a democratic state such as Mexico, the applicant's obligation to obtain state protection is greater. Applicants in that case must show that they have tried to exhaust all courses of action open to them to obtain the necessary state protection. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] F.C.J. No. 343 (QL) at para. 22;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 175 at paras. 21-22;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 291 at para. 6).
[30]
If a refugee protection claimant failed to take all available measures to seek state protection, the Court finds that it is not enough to rely solely on documentary evidence of flaws in the justice system of the refugee protection claimant's country of origin ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 450). The applicant did not want to go to the authorities out of fear, and he did not approach higher authorities or other agencies. By not taking measures to seek state protection before making a claim for refugee protection, the applicant failed to rebut the presumption of state protection (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] F.C.J. No. 620 (QL)).
[31]
The Court is of the opinion that, even though there are still problems with corruption  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the evidence shows that there are avenues-albeit at times still imperfect-of state protection that were available to the applicant. Under the circumstances, the Court finds that the panel's decision is reasonable. The applicant did not try to seek out other means of state protection and did not show that state protection was not reasonably available  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[32]
For these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed. The parties did not propose a question for certification, and no question arises on this record.

Manuel Alejandro Romero Castañeda (partie demanderesse) v. Le Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration (partie défenderesse)
[1]
Le juge Boivin
: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés, L.C. 2001, ch. 27 (la loi), à l'encontre d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (le tribunal) datée le 16 septembre 2009, selon laquelle le demandeur n'est pas un réfugié au sens de la Convention ni une personne à protéger en vertu de la loi.
Contexte factuel
[2]
Le demandeur est un citoyen du Mexique qui allègue craindre la persécution aux mains d'un groupe d'agents de la police judiciaire fédérale de Colonia Paraje San Juan où il demeure.
[3]
Le 19 décembre 2006, il est allégué que monsieur Francisco Javier Davalos Aguilar, un ami du demandeur, fut battu par deux agents de la police judiciaire fédérale. On aurait menacé ce dernier s'il n'allait pas travailler avec un groupe impliqué dans le vol de voitures et de pièces de voiture. Le demandeur et son ami ont fait une plainte au ministère public le même jour.
[4]
Le 8 janvier 2007, le demandeur a déposé une deuxième plainte et il fut arrêté par la patrouille de la police judiciaire fédérale. Le demandeur a reçu des soins médicaux à une clinique médicale. Le médecin qu'il a vu, Dr. Medrano, lui a dit de dénoncer l'incident aux autorités ou sinon elle le ferait. Lorsque le demandeur est retourné chez lui, sa mère lui a dit de faire une plainte au ministère public à Ixtapalapa pour sa détention illégale mais il n'a pas reçu de copie de cette accusation.
[5]
Après avoir consulté un avocat, le demandeur a fait une plainte aux autorités le 9 janvier 2007, mais les agents ne l'ont pas écouté et lui ont dit qu'ils voulaient des témoins. Le 18 février 2007, le demandeur a fait une autre dénonciation au ministère public, mais on lui a dit qu'il ne pouvait pas dénoncer car il s'agissait d'un événement qui impliquait son oncle et c'est ce dernier qui devait faire la dénonciation.
[6]
Le demandeur est allé à Guadalajara, Jalisco chez son ami Carlos Alberto car il ne voulait pas quitter son pays et sa mère. L'avocat du demandeur l'a ensuite avisé qu'il n'avait pas pu obtenir des copies de ses plaintes et que les plaintes étaient inactives.
[7]
Le 20 mai 2007, le demandeur est sorti avec son ami Carlos Alberto. Une voiture blanche les suivait et le demandeur a reconnu un des policiers qui participait à l'opération de voitures volées dans le quartier. Le demandeur a ensuite fui à Morelos, Mochoacán le 21 mai 2007.
[8]
Le demandeur a quitté le Mexique le 12 juin 2007. Il a fait une demande d'asile au Canada le lendemain de son arrivée.
Décision contestée
[9]
Le tribunal a d'abord conclu que le demandeur n'était pas crédible car il n'a produit aucune preuve corroborant les éléments essentiels de son récit et il n'a pas raisonnablement expliqué son défaut de le faire. Le tribunal a rejeté les explications du demandeur concernant ses efforts pour obtenir les documents qui se sont avérés contradictoires.
[10]
De plus, le tribunal a conclu que même s'il avait été jugé crédible, le demandeur n'a pas démontré le refus ou l'incapacité de protection de l'État par une preuve claire et convaincante. Le tribunal a considéré que le demandeur s'était adressé aux autorités, mais a conclu qu'il n'avait pas épuisé les recours qui s'offraient à lui. Après avoir considéré la preuve documentaire, le tribunal a déterminé que le demandeur aurait pu s'adresser à d'autres autorités en place au Mexique qui s'occupent des problèmes de corruption policière.
Questions en litige
[11]
Cette demande de contrôle judiciaire présente les questions suivantes:
1. Est-ce que le tribunal a erré en concluant que le demandeur n'était pas crédible?
2. Est-ce que le tribunal a erré en concluant que le demandeur pouvait se prévaloir de la protection de l'État du Mexique?
Analyse
Norme de contrôle
[12]
L'évaluation de la crédibilité et l'appréciation de la preuve relèvent de la compétence du tribunal administratif qui doit apprécier l'allégation d'une crainte subjective d'un demandeur d'asile ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la norme de contrôle applicable dans des circonstances semblables était celle de la décision manifestement déraisonnable. Depuis, il s'agit de la décision raisonnable.
[13]
La norme de contrôle applicable aux questions de protection de l'État est la raisonnabilité (Dunsmuir aux par. 55, 57, 62 et 64 ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 1 au par. 38 ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 968 au par. 14).
1. Est-ce que le tribunal a erré en concluant que le demandeur n'était pas crédible?
[14]
Il est bien établi que les questions de crédibilité, d'évaluation des faits et d'appréciation de la preuve relèvent entièrement de la discrétion du tribunal, à titre de juge des faits ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 118;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 1228) et il n'appartient pas à la cour de substituer son appréciation de la preuve à celle du tribunal.
[15]
Le demandeur prétend que le tribunal n'a pas fait diligence dans l'étude de la preuve documentaire et qu'il n'a pas considéré le fait que la police au Mexique connaît des problèmes de corruption.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 783, cette Cour a noté que l'obligation de commenter une preuve documentaire dans une décision dépend de l'importance de cette preuve. En l'espèce, le demandeur allègue que la preuve documentaire ignorée portait sur des faits au cœur de la revendication du demandeur, ce qui rend la décision du tribunal déraisonnable.
[16]
Toutefois, la Cour note que le tribunal a relevé plusieurs omissions et contradictions dans le témoignage du demandeur, notamment:
a. Lors de l'incident du 19 décembre 2006, le demandeur a dit que lui et son ami Francisco avaient signé une plainte et ils avaient demandé une copie, mais les autorités avaient refusé de leur en fournir une copie. Le demandeur n'a pas inclus cette information dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) car il ne croyait pas qu'il s'agissait d'un détail important. Il a toutefois admis par la suite qu'il s'agit d'une information importante.
b. Le demandeur a d'abord nié avoir demandé à son avocat d'obtenir des copies de ses plaintes et il dit ensuite avoir demandé des copies à sa mère. Plus tard, il dit que son avocat demandait de 8,000 à 9,000 pesos pour obtenir une copie des plaintes et il refusait de l'aider. Ceci n'était pas mentionné dans le FRP du demandeur. Le demandeur a ensuite demandé à sa mère de trouver un autre avocat, ce qu'elle a fait en avril 2008, mais ce deuxième avocat demandait aussi de 7,000 à 8,000 pesos. Ces informations ne figurent pas dans le FRP et selon le demandeur, son avocat a refusé de lui envoyer une lettre confirmant les événements au Mexique de peur d'avoir des problèmes avec la police au Mexique ou les autorités au  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  aussi fait de nombreux appels téléphoniques pour tenter de l'obtenir. Cette information était également absente de son FRP et le demandeur n'a pas pu expliquer cette omission. Plus particulièrement, le tribunal a fait référence à la preuve documentaire, notamment le document MEX102725.E du 17 avril 2008 portant le titre « Police reports; procedures to obtain a copy from the various police forces; the cost; the persons who can obtain a copy; the time it takes to obtain a copy; the possibility of obtaining a copy from Canada » qui démontre que le demandeur en l'espèce aurait pu obtenir des copies des rapports policiers en écrivant directement aux autorités ou avec l'aide d'un avocat.
[17]
Bien que le demandeur ait dit craindre la persécution aux mains d'un groupe d'agents de la police judiciaire fédérale de Colonia Paraje San Juan, aucune preuve tangible n'a été déposée au soutien de cet élément. De plus, la Cour est d'avis que le demandeur n'a pas raisonnablement expliqué son défaut de produire de la preuve corroborant les plaintes qu'il prétend avoir déposées aux autorités.
[18]
Sur cette base, le tribunal était en droit de tirer une inférence négative, d'une part, quant à la crédibilité du demandeur en raison de l'absence de preuve corroborante et, d'autre part, en raison de l'absence d'explications raisonnables et crédibles pour expliquer son défaut de produire cette preuve. Il est de jurisprudence constante que le tribunal peut tirer une conclusion défavorable du fait qu'un demandeur n'a pas produit une preuve corroborante pour étayer son témoignage et sur l'absence d'efforts pour obtenir une telle corroboration documentaire ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 809 et  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 725).
[19]
Le tribunal est le mieux placé pour évaluer les explications fournies par les demandeurs au sujet des contradictions et invraisemblances apparentes et il n'appartient pas à la Cour de substituer son jugement aux conclusions de fait tirées par le tribunal au sujet de la crédibilité du demandeur ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 325 au par. 36;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)). En l'espèce, les explications du demandeur pour justifier l'absence de preuve qui corrobore son récit ne sont pas raisonnables.
[20]
Somme toute, je suis d'avis que le demandeur, en l'espèce, n'a pas démontré que le tribunal a rendu une décision fondée sur des conclusions de faits erronées, tirées de façon abusive ou arbitraire, sans tenir compte de la preuve.
2. Est-ce que le tribunal a erré en concluant que le demandeur pouvait se prévaloir de la protection de l'État du Mexique?
[21]
Le demandeur avance que le tribunal ne considère pas l'information concernant le Mexique selon laquelle le pays est aux prises avec une corruption inégalable et omniprésente dans son analyse de la disponibilité de la protection de l'État.
[22]
Le défendeur note qu'il incombe au demandeur d'établir de façon claire et convaincante que l'État du Mexique était incapable d'assurer sa protection (Canada (Procureur général) c. Ward, [1993] 2 R.C.S. 689, 153 N.R. 321). Il ne suffit pas au demandeur de démontrer que la protection de l'État n'était pas parfaite car aucun gouvernement qui adhère aux valeurs démocratiques ou affirme son respect des droits de la personne ne peut garantir la protection de chacun de ses citoyens en tout temps (Canada (Ministre de l'emploi et de l'immigration) c. Villafranca, (1992), 150 N.R. 232, 37 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1259 (C.A.F.)).
[23]
Le tribunal a considéré les allégations du demandeur à l'effet qu'il se soit adressé aux autorités mexicaines en vue d'obtenir la protection. Plusieurs décisions de cette Cour ont déterminé que le Mexique est en mesure de protéger ses citoyens malgré les problèmes de corruption et même lorsque les agents persécuteurs sont des policiers ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 694 au par. 18;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 705 au par. 10).
[24]
Le tribunal a aussi noté que le demandeur n'a jamais sollicité la protection auprès d'instances supérieures au Mexique. Compte tenu de la preuve documentaire qui révèle les efforts contre la corruption policière et l'existence d'autres organisations où le demandeur aurait pu s'adresser, il était raisonnable pour le tribunal de rejeter l'explication du demandeur qu'il ne s'était pas adressé aux instances supérieures parce qu'il avait peur. Comme la souligné la procureure de la défenderesse à l'audience, le demandeur se devait d'épuiser les recours qui lui sont offerts dans son pays, ce qu'il n'a pas fait. Compte tenu que la preuve au dossier démontre qu'il existe d'autres organismes où le demandeur aurait pu se plaindre, il était raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que le demandeur fournisse des efforts pour se prévaloir de d'autres mesures avant de rechercher la protection internationale.
[25]
Dans sa décision, le tribunal reconnaît plusieurs initiatives contre la corruption de fonctionnaires impliqués dans des activités illégales dans les dernières années. Le Cartable national de documentation du 29 juin 2009 à la section 7.1, soit le Narcotics Control Strategy Report des États-Unis, mentionne les efforts du président Calderon contre les trafiquants de drogue et contre la corruption par des policiers. Il y a aussi d'autres ressources telles que le Secrétariat de l'Administration Publique, qui offre des services variés aux citoyens qui veulent signaler des actes de corruption.
[26]
Malgré cela, le demandeur a dit ne pas avoir fait appel aux autorités fédérales par crainte. Cette explication ne peut être acceptée car la suffisance de la protection de l'état ne peut reposer sur la peur subjective du demandeur. La présomption de la protection de l'état ne peut être réfutée sur cette seule base subjective ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 116).
[27]
Pour réfuter la présomption de protection de l'État, le demandeur doit présenter une preuve claire et convaincante de l'incapacité de l'État de fournir une protection. La preuve doit être pertinente et fiable et être en mesure de convaincre le juge des faits que la protection de l'État est insuffisante ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[28]
La protection de l'État ne doit pas être parfaite car aucun gouvernement ne peut garantir la protection de tous ses citoyens à tout moment. Il suffit que la protection de l'État soit adéquate ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 191;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 904).
[29]
L'obligation qui incombe au demandeur d'obtenir la protection de l'État augmente lorsqu'il s'agit d'un État démocratique comme le Mexique. Le demandeur en l'espèce doit démontrer qu'il a tenté d'épuiser tous les recours s'offrant à lui en vue d'obtenir la protection nécessaire ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] A.C.F. no 343 (QL) au par. 22;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 175 aux par. 21-22;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 291 au par. 6).
[30]
Si un demandeur d'asile a omis de prendre toutes les mesures disponibles pour chercher la protection de l'État, la Cour constate qu'il n'est pas suffisant de se baser uniquement sur la preuve documentaire étayant certaines failles dans le système de justice de son pays d'origine ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 450). Le demandeur ne voulait pas aller voir les autorités car il avait peur, et il ne s'est pas adressé à des autorités supérieures ou d'autres organismes. En omettant de prendre des mesures pour chercher la protection de l'État avant de faire une demande d'asile, le demandeur n'a pas réfuté la présomption de la protection de l'État ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] A.C.F. no 620 (QL)).
[31]
La Cour est d'avis que même s'il y a encore des problèmes de corruption au Mexique, la preuve démontre qu'il existe des voies - bien que parfois encore imparfaites - de protection de l'État qui étaient accessibles au demandeur. Dans ces circonstances, la Cour constate que la décision du tribunal est raisonnable. Le demandeur n'a pas tenté de rechercher d'autres moyens de protection de l'État et il n'a pas démontré que la protection de l'État n'était pas raisonnablement disponible au Mexique.
[32]
Pour ces motifs, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. Les parties n'ont proposé aucune question à certifier et ce dossier n'en contient aucune.

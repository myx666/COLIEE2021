 Summary: 
 
 Adjani sponsored his son's application for permanent residence as a member of the family class. A visa officer denied the application because Adjani had not declared the child as his dependent at the time of his processing or landing in Canada, contrary to s. 117(9)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations. Adjani appealed. The Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board dismissed the appeal. Adjani applied for judicial review of the IAD's decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 I.  
 Introduction  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] 
   
 Blanchard, J. 
 : The Applicant, Joshua Taiwo Adjani, seeks judicial review of the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board; Immigration Appeal Division (the Board) dated April 2, 2007, denying the his appeal of a visa officer's refusal of his son's sponsorship. The Application is brought pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection  
 Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the  
 IRPA 
 ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II.  
 Factual Background  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The Applicant was born on May 1, 1960, in Accra in Ghana. He holds Ghanaian and Canadian citizenships. He was recognized as a refugee in Canada in 1996. He then applied for and obtained permanent residence in Canada. He became a Canadian citizen in 1999.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The Applicant visited Nigeria on several occasions and had a casual relationship with a girlfriend there in the late eighties.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  During a trip to Nigeria in 2003, the Applicant's sister informed him that his former girlfriend had a son who looked like him. He then discovered that he had a son with the girlfriend he was with in the eighties and a DNA test confirmed that he was the father of the child.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  The Applicant developed a relationship with the child and sponsored him as member of the family class. His son applied for a permanent resident visa. The visa officer refused to grant a permanent visa to his son on October 19, 2006, because he did not meet the requirements for immigration to Canada. Specifically, because the Applicant, as the sponsor, had not declared the child as his dependant at the time of his processing or landing in Canada contrary to paragraph 117(9)(d) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations 
 , SOR/2002-227 (the  
 Regulations 
 ). The visa officer concluded that since the son was not declared and examined at that time, he could not then, be considered a member of the family class.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  On December 18, 2006, the Applicant filed an appeal of the visa officer's decision with the Board pursuant subsection 63(1) of the  
 IRPA 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  On April 2, 2007, the Board dismissed the Applicant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Board concluded that "... the appellant's non-disclosure of the applicant when he applied for landing prohibit him from sponsoring him in the future because section 117(9)(d) of the  
 Regulations 
  is meant to preclude an appellant from sponsoring family members who were not examination [sic] at the time the application for permanent residence was made. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [8] 
  The Board acknowledged that the Applicant did not know he was the father until recently, well after he was landed in Canada. The Board nevertheless found that, "... knowingly or not, the appellant precluded not only the visa officer from having him examined, but it also precluded him from sponsoring the applicant at a later date. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [9] 
  The Board further observed that humanitarian and compassionate considerations, if any, should have been raised with the visa officer pursuant to s. 25(1) of the  
 IRPA 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  On May 17, 2007, the Applicant filed the within application for judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  The Applicant raises the following issues in this application:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 A. Does the application of paragraph 117(9)(d) of the  
 Regulations 
  violate the Applicant's  
 Charter 
  rights as provided for under s. 15(1) of the  
 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
 , Schedule B, Part I to the  
 Canada Act 1982 
  (U.K.) 1982, c. 11 (the  
 Charter 
 )?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 B. Is paragraph 117(9)(d) of the  
 Regulations 
  ultra vires the  
 IRPA 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 C. Was the decision rendered by the Board unreasonable?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V.  
 Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  It is unclear if the  
 Charter 
  arguments raised on this application were before the Board. In the circumstances, and to the extent that the determination of a standard of review is required, the two first issues involve the interpretation of paragraph 117(9)(d) of the  
 Regulations 
  and related provisions of the  
 IRPA 
  including a constitutional question. The applicable standard of review for such questions is correctness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The third issue concerns the application of paragraph 117(9)(d) of the  
 Regulations 
  to the facts. This is a question of mixed fact and law reviewable on the standard of reasonableness simpliciter. ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 14;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 17-20). An unreasonable decision is one that, in the main, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination ( 
 Director of Investigation and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 56).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Legislative provisions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  The pertinent legislative provisions have been reproduced in Annex.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VII.  
 Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 A.  
 Does the application of paragraph 117(9)(d) of the  
 Regulations 
  violate the Applicant's  
 Charter 
  rights as provided for under s. 15(1) of the  
 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
   
 Schedule B, Part I to the  
 Canada Act 1982 
  (U.K.) 1982 c. 11 (the  
 Charter 
 )?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The Applicant submits that because his son was born out of wedlock and that he was unaware of the child's existence; his son is being treated differently than other children applying for permanent residence. He argues that such discrimination is a violation of his s. 15(1)  
 Charter 
  right; namely the right to be treated equally. The Applicant claims that as a member of a specific group, his son will be excluded by Canadian law based on his age and lineage. The Applicant contends that the impugned provision reflects a demeaning and prejudicial view of the child's worth simply because he was born out of wedlock.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  The Respondent claims that the Applicant's s. 15(1)  
 Charter 
  argument must fail because paragraph 117(9)(d) of the  
 Regulations 
  makes no distinction between a dependent child born out of wedlock or not. Rather, it contemplates timely disclosure versus non-disclosure of members of the family class and whether these members may be examined by the immigration authorities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  In order to determine whether an enactment violates a s. 15  
 Charter 
  right, the Supreme Court teaches that the following three broad inquiries as outlined in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 39, be conducted:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "... Does the impugned law (a) draw a formal distinction between the claimant and others on the basis of one or more personal characteristics or (b) fail to take into account the claimant's already disadvantaged position within Canadian society resulting in substantively differential treatment between the claimant and others on the basis of one or more personal characteristics? If so, there is differential treatment for the purpose of s. 15(1). Second, was the claimant subject to differential treatment on the basis of one or more of the enumerated and analogous grounds? And third, does the differential treatment discriminate in a substantive sense, bringing into play the purpose of s. 15(1) of the  
 Charter 
  in remedying such ills as prejudice, stereotyping, and historical disadvantage? The second and third inquiries are concerned with whether the differential treatment constitutes discrimination in the substantive sense intended by s. 15(1). <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [18] 
  The Applicant contends that the inevitable result that would flow from these inquiries would be that the impugned provision violates his s. 15  
 Charter 
  rights and that the provision would not be justified under section 1 of the  
 Charter 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  As the Supreme Court teaches in  
 Law 
 , the first step in the required analysis to determine whether  
 Charter 
  rights have been violated is to identify the comparator group. The equality guarantee is a comparative concept. Identifying the appropriate comparator is necessary in assessing differential treatment and the grounds of the distinction. Several factors are considered to locate the appropriate comparator. For example, the subject matter of the legislation, the biological, historical and sociological similarities or dissimilarities may be relevant in establishing the relevant comparator in particular, and whether the legislation effects discrimination in a substantive sense more generally.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  The Applicant contends that the comparator group at issue here would be those children born out of wedlock versus legitimate children. There is simply no basis for this assertion. The regulatory scheme makes clear that a dependent child of a sponsor may be a member of a family class. There is no requirement that the child be born from parents that are married. There is no prohibition relating to a child born out of wedlock in the applicable regulations. Paragraph 117(1)(a) of the  
 Regulations 
  speaks only of "a dependent child of the sponsor". Here, there is no dispute; the child at issue is the dependent child of the Applicant, the sponsor. The proper comparator group is rather the accompanying family members of the sponsor that may be examined. The differential treatment at issue here has no nexus with whether the child was born out of wedlock or not. On the basis of this stated characteristic, there is simply no differential treatment that would flow from the application of the impugned legislation. In short, the arguments advanced by the Applicant and the circumstances here do not support a foundation for a claim of infringement of the Applicant's s. 15  
 Charter 
  rights. Consequently, the Applicant's s. 15  
 Charter 
  argument must fail.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 B.  
 Is paragraph 117(9)(d) of the  
 Regulations 
  ultra vires the  
 IRPA  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  The Applicant contends that the Board's decision does not respect the stated objectives of the  
 IRPA 
 , in particular the objective "to see that families are reunited in Canada." The Applicant further contends that the principle of the protection of the family and the best interest of the child concerned are violated by a mechanical application of the impugned regulation. As I understand the Applicant's argument, the impugned regulation and its application are in direct conflict with the above stated objective and the purpose of the  
 IRPA 
 , and is consequently ultra vires the  
 IRPA 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  Parliament has the right to adopt immigration policy and to enact legislation prescribing the conditions under which non-citizens will be permitted to enter and remain in Canada. This it has done by enacting the  
 IRPA 
 :  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 27. The  
 IRPA 
  and  
 Regulations 
  made pursuant to paragraphs 14(2)(b) and (d) thereof, set out a regulatory scheme that essentially controls the admission of foreign nationals to Canada ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Family reunification and the best interest of children are recognized as valid purposes under the  
 IRPA 
  and are to be considered when relevant. The legislation also has other purposes, one of which is the maintenance of the integrity of the Canadian refugee protection system. The Federal Court of Appeal had to consider whether paragraph 117 (9)(d) of the  
 Regulations 
  was ultra vires the  
 IRPA 
  in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Justice Rothstein, writing for the majority stated the following at paragraphs 28-29 of his reasons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "[28] Paragraph 117(9)(d) does not bar family reunification. It simply provides that non-accompanying family members who have not been examined  
 for a reason other than a decision by a visa officer 
  will not be admitted as members of the family class. A humanitarian and compassionate application under section 25 of the  
 IRPA 
  may be made for Mr. Azizi's dependants or they may apply to be admitted under another category in the  
 IRPA 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "[29] Mr. Azizi says these are undesirable alternatives. It is true that they are less desirable from his point of view than had his dependants been considered to be members of the family class. But it was Mr. Azizi's misrepresentation that has caused the problem. He is the author of this misfortune. He cannot claim that paragraph 117(9)(d) is ultra vires simply because he has run afoul of it." (My emphasis)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  The Court of Appeal has therefore decided that the impugned regulation is not utltra vires the  
 IRPA 
  particularly in cases where there is a misrepresentation to immigration authorities. Here, however, the Applicant did not know of his son's existence at the time of his application for permanent residence. He cannot, therefore, be said to have concealed this information or to have misrepresented his circumstances. In my view, it matters not whether non-disclosure is deliberate or not. The regulation is clear, paragraph 117(9)(d) makes no distinction as to the reason for which an non-accompanying family member of the sponsor was not disclosed in his application for permanent residence. What matters, is the absence of examination by an officer that necessarily flows from the non-disclosure. This interpretation is consistent with the findings of my Colleague, Justice Mosley in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where the scope and effect of the impugned regulation were found not to be limited to cases of fraudulent non-disclosure. At paragraph 11 of his reasons, my learned colleague wrote, "... Whatever the motive, a failure to disclose which prevents the immigration officer from examining the dependent precludes future sponsorship of that person as a member of the family class. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [25] 
  The provisions of paragraph 117(9)(d) of the  
 Regulations 
  are not inconsistent with the stated purposes and objectives of the  
 IRPA 
 . I am in agreement with the view expressed by Justice Kelen at paragraph 38 of his reasons in  
 de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that "The objective of family reunification does not override, outweigh, supersede or trump the basic requirement that the immigration law must be respected, and administered in an orderly and fair manner." Further, in exceptional circumstances where humanitarian and compassionate factors are compelling, an applicant can seek, pursuant to s. 25(1) of the  
 IRPA 
 , a ministerial exemption to the statutory and regulatory requirements for admission to Canada. Such an application remains open to the Applicant. If successful, the Applicant could be reunited with his son. ( 
 Chen 
 , above, at para. 18).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  For the above reasons, I find that the impugned regulation is not ultra vires the  
 IRPA 
  nor inconsistent with its stated objectives or purposes.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 C.  
 Was the decision rendered by the Board unreasonable?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  The Applicant challenges the reasonableness of the Board's decision. The only arguments raised on this application are in respect to the s. 15  
 Charter 
  rights and the vires of the impugned regulation. Both of these arguments were dealt with above.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  As stated earlier, the impugned regulation, in the circumstances of this case, does not violate the Applicant's s. 15  
 Charter 
  rights and is not ultra vires the  
 IRPA 
 . Given the mandatory nature of the regulation and its imperative language, the Board had no option but to dismiss the sponsorship application and in so doing committed no reviewable error. For the above reasons, this judicial review application will be dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VIII.  
 Question for certification  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  The Applicant has submitted the following question for certification:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Does subsection 117(9)(d) of the  
 IRPR 
  apply to exclude non-accompanying family members from membership from the family class in circumstances where the sponsor was unaware of their existence at the time of his/her application for Permanent Residence and Landing in Canada?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  The proposed question suggests that the impugned regulation be interpreted to read in an element of subjective knowledge by the Sponsor regarding the non-disclosure so that deliberate or fraudulent non-disclosure be required for a finding under paragraph 117(9)(d) of the  
 Regulations 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  In my view the impugned provision does not allow for such an interpretation. The language is clear and unambiguous, subjective knowledge of the misrepresentation or non-disclosure is not contemplated in the regulation. The Court of Appeal in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 28 of its reasons, interpreted the provision as follows: "It simply provides that non-accompanying family members who have not been examined  
 for a reason other than a decision by a visa officer 
  will not be admitted as members of the family class." (My emphasis) This interpretation is consistent with decisions of the Federal Court. As stated above, in  
 Chen 
  at paragraph 11, the motive is unimportant, a failure to disclose which prevents examination of the dependent precludes future sponsorship of that person as a member of the family class. See also  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  In my view, the meaning, scope, purpose and application of the impugned regulation have been comprehensively dealt with in the jurisprudence. The scope of the regulation is not limited to deliberate or fraudulent non-disclosure but to any non-disclosure which may prevent examination of a dependent. Non-disclosed, non-accompanying family members cannot be admitted as members of the family class. The proposed question has been answered, and is consequently inappropriate for certification.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IX.  
 Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  This application for judicial review will be dismissed. I do not propose to certify a question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

[1]
Campbell, J.
: The present Application concerns a Wahta Mohawk First Nation (First Nation) governance dispute.
[2]
The salient features of the dispute are as follows: as a result of an election in March 2011 the government of the First Nation was composed of Chief Blaine Commandant, an Applicant in the present Application, and four Councillors who are the Respondents in the present Application; in October 2011, by a vote of the four Councillors pursuant to the
Election Rules and Regulations
approved January 8, 2011 (
Election
Regulations
) Chief Commandant was relieved of his office because he failed to attend three consecutive Council meetings; Mr. Commandant did not contest the Councillors' decision by way of judicial review nor was a by-election held as required by the
Election Regulations
to fill the office of Chief because of uncertainty as to who in the First Nation membership would be eligible to vote; in June, 2012, pursuant to the
Election
Regulations
, by a Petition vote of 50 plus one of the voters who voted in the March 2011 election the Councillors were relieved of their offices; nevertheless, the Councillors did not adhere to the vote with the result that on June 21, 2012 the present Application was commenced to challenge their jurisdiction to remain in office.
[3]
Despite intense disagreement that played out over many months bringing the Application to hearing, in the end a settlement was reached. At a point early in the hearing of the present Application, with my encouragement, the parties agreed to work with their Counsel to find a just solution, by consent. After many hours of effort the solution was found. Attached, as an APPENDIX to these reasons, is the Settlement Agreement (Agreement) reached. To the real credit of the parties, the settlement was not accomplished by mediation; it was accomplished by good faith negotiation.
[4]
Given that the Agreement was accomplished, no findings were made on the merits of the Application. At the hearing the terms of the Agreement were read into the record, one term being that "the Application will be dismissed with costs to be determined by the Court". For clarification, it is agreed that the Agreement misstates this fact in the phrase "the application is dismissed with costs payable to the Respondents to be determined by the Court". The point of difference is that whether any costs are payable is within my discretion.
[5]
Pursuant to the Agreement, by the present Reasons for Order and Order the Application is dismissed and the outstanding issue of costs is addressed. During the motions history of the present Application, two orders were made deferring a decision on costs pending the outcome of the Application, and one order was made for "costs in the cause". Since the Application concluded in a settlement, I find that consideration of the orders merges into the present Reasons for Order and Order.
[6]
Upon reaching the Agreement, Counsel for the Applicants stated that the Applicants were not requesting an order for costs. However, Counsel for the Respondents stated that the Respondents request that costs be awarded in their favour.
I.
The Test to be Applied on the Costs Issue
[7]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Randall)
at paragraphs 14, 21 and 22, Prothonotary Lafrenière states a caution which I find applies in the present case:
The result of the proceeding usually carries significant weight because, as a general rule, costs should follow the event:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) at 464. Where success has been fairly evenly divided, however, there should normally be no order as to costs:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) at 25.
[...]
The Court must also be mindful about the chilling effect of awarding costs against a party after the conclusion of a mediation
. It is now widely accepted that dispute resolution conferences have a significant role to play in the litigation process. A mediated settlement can produce solutions that exceed those available through the courts. Its success is contingent, however, upon the parties buying in to the process.
The litigation between the Claimants and the Band Council brought a number of festering issues to a head, and resulted in negotiated settlement that will no doubt contribute to a better environment and understanding in the community, to the credit of all parties. [Emphasis added]
I believe that the message communicated in the caution is that the benefit of a settlement will be lost if a costs award is made because the contention which the settlement resolved will most certainly continue. This is so because the award will be perceived as a win in a result where there is to be no winner and no loser.
[8]
In the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Mohawk of Akwensasne
), Justice Lemieux quotes Prothonotary Lafrenière's caution with approval, but, nevertheless, at paragraph 12 confirms that, as a general rule, even where a litigation settlement is reached, an award of costs might be made under certain circumstances:
However, costs can be awarded on the basis of the conduct of the parties during the course of the litigation such as: (1) whether it was reasonable for a party to raise, pursue or contest a particular allegation or issue; (2) whether a party properly pursued or defended its case or a particular allegation or issue; (3) whether a party exaggerated its claim or raised a baseless defence; and (4) whether a party properly conceded issues or abandoned allegations during discoveries.
In my opinion, the general rule might easily be applied in the settlement of a commercial dispute, for example, but, as a practical matter, it is extremely difficult to fairly apply in the settlement of a First Nation's governance dispute.
[9]
A unique factor, which militates towards the settlement of a First Nations governance dispute, is motivation to adhere to the cultural value that balance must be restored to the community. Thus, given the application of this higher principle, to maintain a dispute beyond a settlement reached by a request for costs is counter-indicated because the governance dispute just settled is, in fact, not settled and balance will not be achieved.
[10]
Thus, because of the unique nature of a First Nations governance dispute, in my opinion where a settlement is reached, whether by mediation or direct negotiation, each party should bear their own costs unless a clear serious reason exists to ground an award for costs. As found in
Mohawk of Akwensasne
a serious reason can be found across a range: unreasonable actions and mistakes made in the course of litigation at one end to unacceptable reprehensible behaviour at the other.
II.
The Test Applied to the Present Costs Dispute
[11]
While the Applicants make no request for costs, the Respondents request an award of costs on a full indemnity basis in the amount of $531,236.44 grounded on an allegation of unacceptable reprehensible behaviour in conducting the litigation on the part of Counsel for the Applicants, acting on the instructions of the Applicants.
[12]
Governance disputes in all communities are strong: there is much at stake. Thus, each party to a dispute is willing to invest time, energy, and money in a bid to succeed. However, realistic choices must be made in the approach taken to a particular issue. It might at first seem worthwhile to invest heavily in maintaining a particular position on a particular issue with little or no calm reflection on whether the inflated cost of doing so leads to the conclusion that it is not worth maintaining the position. Of course, the party that takes a hard position is most usually met with hard resistance. And so the fight goes on, and so does the extraordinary expense of it. Often the welfare of the community as a whole is lost as a consideration in the choices made. In my view, prior to the Agreement, this was the experience on both sides of the present dispute, and, in my experience, there is nothing unusual about it.
[13]
On the basis of the costs arguments presented, I find that there are three relevant circumstances upon which to make findings.
A.
The claims
[14]
The Respondents' principal costs argument arises from the claims for relief advanced by the Applicants in the present Application:
(i) a declaration in the nature of a writ of
quo warranto
declaring that the respondents have ceased to be Councillors of the Wahta Mohawks Band;
(ii) an order that a prompt by-election to elect a Chief and Councillors for the Wahta Mohawks Band be held at which election the applicant Blaine Commandant shall be at liberty to stand for election as Chief;
(iii) an order for costs; and
(iv) such further or other order as to this Honourable Court appears just.
[15]
As mentioned above, given the outcome of the Petition vote, and given that the Councillors did not adhere to the vote, it is readily apparent that the primary objective of the Application was to have the Court declare that, by the vote, the Councillors lost jurisdiction to govern. In response to the Application the onus was on the Respondent Councillors to establish that the Petition vote could not be relied upon to ground an order for removal. To achieve this result the Respondents alleged irregularities in the Petition process. Thus, the straightforward focus of the Application was on the quality of the Petition vote.
[16]
However, the claims of the Application went beyond the removal of the Respondents. As mentioned, a by-election was not held to fill the vacant office of Chief as required by the
Election Regulations
. It appears that, if the Applicants were successful on the
quo warranto
claim, the purpose of the second claim was to require a by-election election to be held, not only to fill their offices, but to fill the vacant office of Chief as well. However, in making the second claim for relief, it is also readily apparent that a primary objective of the Application was to provide an opportunity for Mr. Commandant to regain his position as Chief by attempting a review and rectification of his removal as Chief, which was a decision that he did not contest by judicial review.
[17]
The Application was prepared and filed by Mr. Schindler who preceded present Counsel for the Applicants. With respect to attempting to engage a review of Mr. Commandant's removal, the grounds, which rely on Mr. Commandant's affidavit filed in support of the Application, read as follows:
6. The applicant Blaine Commandant was continuously the Chief of the Wahta Mohawks from 1999 until 27th October 2011. On this latter date the respondents, acting as Council of the Wahta Mohawks, declared the office of Chief to be vacant by reason of the Chief having missed three consecutive meetings of Council.
6. [sic] The applicant Blaine Commandant had just cause for missing the three meetings and was given no notice of the proposed resolution of the Council declaring the office of Chief to be vacant.
7. The applicant Blaine Commandant did not seek judicial review of the purported declaration that his office was vacant at the time as he could not work with the current Council and their removal from office was a pre-requisite for his seeking re-instatement or re-election as Chief of the Wahta Mohawks.
8. The applicants rely on the provisions of sections 18 (1) and 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act.
Mr. Commandant's affidavit of June 15, 2012 filed in support of the Application gives a clear picture of his interests in participating in the Application:
38. Acting as if the declaration that my office as Chief was vacated was valid, the respondents acting as the Council of the Wahta Mohawks advised the community in newsletters in January and February 2012 that an election for Chief would be held on 21st April 2012 but subsequently, on 12th April 2012, after nominations were closed, advised the community that the proposed election was cancelled, with setting a date for a new election.
39. As a result, with the purported vacancy of the office of Chief and given the public petition recalling the four Councillors, there is no elected member of the community left who can take responsibility for the affairs of the community pending a by-election for Chief and councillors.
40. I am willing to take on this responsibility pending the required bye-election [sic] and wish to have the option of standing for election as Chief at the bye-election [sic]. For this reason, I am providing this affidavit in support of an application for a declaration that the offices of the four Councillors elected in March 2011 are vacant and that my purported removal from office by reason of the motion of 27th October 2011 is of no force and effect and requring [sic] a new election for Chief and Council to be called as soon as the election rules permit, together with interim relief enjoining the four councillors and the administrator appointed by them from exercising any of the powers of their respective positions and clothing me with the sole authority to administer the affairs of the Wahta Mohawks pending the hearing of the application.
[18]
Indeed, in support of Mr. Commandant's interests, on July 10, 2012, Mr. Schindler filed a motion for injunctive relief claiming as follows:
(i) an interlocutory injunction restraining the respondents from exercising any powers as Councillors of the Wahta Mohawks Band pending the hearing of the within application or the holding of the by-election to elect a Chief and Councillors for the Wahta Mohawks Band sought by the applicants;
(ii) a mandatory injunction that pending the hearing of the application or the said by-election the applicant Blaine Commandant shall have and exercise, to the exclusion of all other persons, all of the powers of the Chief and Council of the Wahta Mohawks Band;
(iii) In the alternative, an order for an expedited hearing of the within application under Rule 385.
[19]
Indeed, once retained to replace Mr. Schindler, present Counsel for the Applicants maintained the positions taken by Mr. Schindler. In the Applicants' Memorandum of Fact and Law dated February 28, 2013 with respect to the merits of the Application, the claims for relief stated in the Application are advanced in argument, including the following:
61. Breaches of procedural fairness must be reviewed on a standard of correctness.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Tremblay-Lamer. J.), para. 37 ("'Basil").
62. It is, accordingly, submitted that this Court should consider whether it was correct to declare vacant the office of Chief without according to Chief Commandant the requisites of fairness. The Court should also consider whether it was correct to cancel the special bi-election [sic] in order to conduct a review of the blood quantum requirements of the
Citizenship Code
. Both of these questions involve the application of the
January 2011 Election Regulations
.
[20]
However, just prior to the hearing of the present Application, Counsel for the Applicants gave the following notice to the Court and Counsel for the Respondents by letter dated October 10, 2013:
This matter is scheduled to be heard on Tuesday, October 15, 2013 and Wednesday, October 16, 2013. Please be advised that the Applicants will only be seeking the relief as outlined in the Notice of Application, namely a declaration in the nature of a writ of quo warranto. While the other issues raised in the Applicants' factum are important background to the relief sought, no other relief will be requested other than that described above.
On October 11th, a follow-up notice was given:
Further to my letter of yesterday, for clarity purposes, please be advised that the Applicants will only be seeking the relief as outlined in the Notice of Application, namely a declaration in the nature of a writ of quo warranto and an order that a prompt by-election to elect a Chief and Councillors for the Wahta Mohawks Band be held. My apologies for any confusion.
In her affidavit on the issue of costs affirmed January 15, 2014, Ms. Hensell, Counsel for the Applicants, makes the following statement to explain the second notice:
20. During the course of the Application our clients agreed not to pursue the issue of Mr. Commandant's eligibility to run for the position of Chief. Minor changes such as this in the relief being sought are normal occurrences in the course of litigation and did not represent a change in position by our clients in their Application.
[21]
Given the history of importance of the standing claim to the present Application, in particular with respect to Mr. Commandant's objective, I do not accept that the abandonment of the claim is a "minor change".
[22]
There are serious unresolved problems with the claims advanced by Mr. Schindler and maintained by present Counsel for the Applicants.
[23]
Without approval of the Court, by Rule 302 of the
Federal Courts Rules
, a judicial review Application is limited to addressing a single decision or action. However, in the present Application there are many interlocking claims for relief involving a number of discrete decisions and actions: the Councillors' removal of Mr. Commandant from office; Mr. Commandant's failure to address his removal by judicial review; the Councillors' failure to call a by-election to fill the office of Chief; the holding of the Petition vote; the outcome of the Petition vote; the Councillors' disregard of the Petition vote; and Mr. Commandant's quest to regain office despite the bar from doing so presented by the
Election
Regulations
.
[24]
Under the
Federal Courts Act
the Court has jurisdiction pursuant to s. 18 (1)(a) to determine the Councillors' authority to remain in office, and pursuant to s. 18.1 (3)(a) to order a by-election in appropriate circumstances. However, the Court has no jurisdiction to order that Mr. Commandant be "at liberty to stand" (the standing claim) for election. The qualification of a person to run in a Wahta Mohawk First Nation election is governed exclusively by the First Nation's
Election Regulations
. Furthermore, pursuant to Article II (f) of the
Election
Regulations
, because Mr. Commandant had been removed from the office of Chief in October 2011, he could not qualify to run for office for three years from the time of his removal from office.
[25]
Present Counsel for the Applicants and Counsel for the Respondents should have immediately recognized the problems with the claims advanced by Mr. Schindler. Apparently this did not occur because neither took action to address them during the long course of the litigation by way of limiting the claims, including withdrawal of the standing claim by the Applicants, or a motion to strike the standing claim by the Respondents.
[26]
In my opinion, the conduct of the present Application by both sides inflated the cost of maintaining the litigation well beyond normal and what I consider to be reasonable limits, and I find that both sides are equally responsible for this outcome.
[27]
Nevertheless, I accept Counsel for the Respondents' argument that a great deal of effort went into challenging Mr. Commandant's effort to regain his position as Chief. I find that the introduction of this objective was a mistake on the part of the Applicants and its abandonment does not correct the mistake. Coincidentally, the mistake is named in
Mohawk of Akwensasne,
as quoted above, as a circumstance which might warrant an order for costs: "whether it was reasonable for a party to raise, pursue or contest a particular allegation or issue". Therefore, I find that a clear and serious reason exists to award costs to provide a measure of indemnity to the Respondents for their costs wasted on this issue.
B.
Conflict of interest
[28]
The second costs issue arises from an alleged fear of conflict of interest advanced by the Respondents. The fear was generated by the fact that Mr. Schindler had acted for the First Nation in the past, and since he filed the present Application, and was acting for the Applicants against the existing First Nations government, confidential information he attained as Counsel for the First Nation might be misused in litigating the Application. Despite earnest assurances to alleviate this concern given by Mr. Schindler, and by present Counsel for the Applicants who replaced Mr. Schindler, the Respondents continued to press the issue hard.
[29]
Prothonotary Milczynski finally terminated the intense litigation on the issue in a without prejudice order dated February 4, 2013 in which no findings were made with respect to whether a conflict of interest in fact and law existed, or the relevance of the alleged fear to the present Application. Without such findings, in my opinion it is not possible to attribute blame to the Applicants for strongly resisting the Respondents' adamant position. I find no clear serious reason to award costs on this issue.
C.
Willingness to mediate
[30]
With respect to the failure to reach an agreement on having the Application mediated at an early phase, no blame can be levelled resulting in a costs award. There is a time for mediation when the parties are comfortable engaging in the process. While this Court fully supports mediation at the first opportunity, if it cannot be engaged then, the hope remains with the Court that it will be engaged later when the parties are ready.
[31]
Experience has taught that, at a particular moment in time, the parties to a governance dispute might be willing to sit down and settle their differences. That moment must be carefully chosen to reach a settlement. Climbing the courthouse steps to attend a hearing usually sharpens the senses to the reality that someone else, a judge, who does not know what each litigant knows, is about to decide what the parties might have decided for themselves prior to that moment. Usually the fear of losing a dispute rather than the hope of winning comes clearly into focus. Also, hearing a reminder that only the power of good faith, rather than recrimination, will achieve a just result works to open a passage out of the litigation that has for so long been a punishing reality. These forces create the opportune time to find a self-made solution. In the present case this was the experience at the hearing of the Application.
[32]
I find no clear serious reason to award costs on this issue.
III.
Costs Award
[33]
As an element of the Respondents' argument on the issue of costs, Counsel for the Respondents has provided a Bill of Costs dated November 21, 2013 which states allowable costs claimed pursuant to Column V of Tariff B of the
Federal Courts Rules
, and also "full", "substantial", and "partial" indemnity costs claimed in responding to all the issues raised in the Application. Upon reviewing the Bill of Costs, I make three findings: only the "partial" indemnity costs claimed are reasonable in the amount of $224,080; addressing the complications arising from the Applicants' objective of providing an opportunity for Mr. Commandant to regain his position as Chief generated approximately half of the Respondents' claimed indemnity costs; and, therefore, indemnity costs of $112,040 are potentially attributable to the standing claim issue. Given my finding that both sides are equally responsible for inflating the cost of the litigation, I find that a lump sum award in favour of the Respondents in the amount of $56,020 is fair and just.
IV.
Conclusion
[34]
It is my sincere hope that this decision on costs will end the present litigation. I encourage both the Applicants and the Respondents to focus on the future which they have so carefully crafted in reaching the very important Agreement terminating the Application. In this effort, I wish them success.

.........................
Blaine Commandant, Darrel Bruce Decaire, George Francis Decaire, Elizabeth Bella Roberts, Scott Sahanatien, Lawrence Schell, Neil Schell, Ronald Strength,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  présente demande a trait à un différend sur la gouvernance au sein de la Première Nation des Mohawks de Wahta (la Première Nation).
[2]
Les éléments essentiels du différend sont les suivants. À la suite d'une élection tenue en mars 2011, le gouvernement de la Première Nation a été composé du chef Blaine Commandant, l'un des demandeurs dans le cadre de la présente demande, ainsi que de quatre conseillers, qui sont les défendeurs en l'espèce. En octobre 2011, les quatre conseillers ont voté, conformément aux
Election Rules and Regulations
approuvés le 8 janvier 2011 (le Règlement sur les élections), la destitution du chef Commandant parce qu'il n'avait pas assisté à trois réunions consécutives du Conseil. M. Commandant n'a pas contesté la décision des conseillers par voie de contrôle judiciaire, et on n'a pas procédé non plus à une élection partielle pour combler le poste de chef, comme l'exigeait le Règlement sur les élections, en raison de l'incertitude quant à la question de savoir quels membres de la Première Nation étaient habilités à voter. En juin 2012, par suite d'une pétition signée par 50 pour cent plus un des électeurs ayant voté au scrutin de mars 2011, une élection a été tenue et les conseillers ont été destitués conformément au Règlement sur les élections. Ces derniers n'ont toutefois pas accepté les résultats du vote de sorte que, le 21 juin 2012, les demandeurs ont introduit la présente demande afin de contester le pouvoir des conseillers de rester en poste.
[3]
Malgré la profonde mésentente qui a régné pendant les mois qui ont précédé l'audience relative à la présente demande, les parties sont finalement parvenues à un règlement. Peu après le début de l'audience et avec mes encouragements, les parties et leurs avocats ont travaillé de concert pour en arriver, après de nombreuses heures d'efforts, à une solution juste à laquelle tout le monde a souscrit. L'entente de règlement conclue (l'entente) est jointe à titre d'ANNEXE aux présents motifs. Il est tout à l'honneur des parties qu'elles en soient arrivées à un règlement en engageant des négociations de bonne foi et sans recourir à la médiation.
[4]
Comme les parties sont parvenues à cette entente, aucune conclusion sur le fond n'a été tirée dans le cadre de la demande. On a lu les conditions de l'entente à l'audience, dont la suivante: [traduction] « La demande sera rejetée avec dépens, qui devront être adjugés par la Cour ». Pour clarifier les choses, les parties conviennent que ce n'est pas ce qui est écrit dans l'entente, libellée comme suit: [traduction] « La demande est rejetée avec dépens, payables aux défendeurs, qui devront être adjugés par la Cour ». La différence entre les deux énoncés soulève la question de savoir si j'ai le pouvoir discrétionnaire d'adjuger ou non les dépens.
[5]
Conformément à l'entente, la demande est rejetée et la question en suspens des dépens est réglée par les présents motifs de l'ordonnance et ordonnance. Dans le cadre de la présente demande qui a donné lieu à plusieurs requêtes, deux ordonnances ont été rendues en vue de reporter la décision sur les dépens en attendant l'issue de la demande, et, dans une autre ordonnance, la Cour a déclaré que [traduction] « les dépens suivront l'issue de la cause ». Puisque la demande s'est réglée par une entente, je conclus que l'examen de ces ordonnances doit faire partie des présents motifs de l'ordonnance et ordonnance.
[6]
Lorsque les parties ont conclu l'entente, l'avocate des demandeurs a déclaré que ses clients ne demandaient pas d'adjudication de dépens. L'avocat des défendeurs a toutefois déclaré que ses clients demandaient quant à eux qu'on leur adjuge les dépens.
I.
Critère à appliquer pour régler la question des dépens
[7]
Aux paragraphes 14, 21 et 22 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Randall
), le protonotaire Lafrenière donne une mise en garde que j'estime pertinente pour la présente affaire:
Le résultat de la procédure compte habituellement beaucoup puisque, en règle générale, les dépens suivent l'issue de la cause:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.), à la page 464. Cependant, quand le jugement rendu favorise également les deux parties, aucune ordonnance portant adjudication des dépens ne devrait normalement être rendue:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.), à la page 25.
[...]
La Cour doit également être attentive à l'effet de douche froide qu'auraient des dépens adjugés contre une partie après une médiation.
Il est maintenant largement accepté que les conférences de règlement des litiges jouent un rôle important dans le processus de règlement des litiges. Un règlement faisant suite à une médiation peut produire des solutions dépassant celles dont disposent les tribunaux. Toutefois, le processus de médiation ne peut être couronné de succès que si les parties y croient.
Le litige entre les demandeurs et le conseil de bande a forcé une décision sur un certain nombre de questions latentes et a résulté en un règlement négocié, qui sans aucun doute contribuera à améliorer l'environnement et l'harmonie dans la communauté, ce qui est à l'honneur de toutes les parties.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
Je crois que le message véhiculé par la mise en garde est que l'avantage tiré de la conclusion d'un règlement disparaîtra si l'on adjuge des dépens, parce qu'il y a fort à parier que cela aura pour effet de faire se prolonger le différend qui a fait l'objet d'un règlement, car l'adjudication de dépens sera perçue comme un gain alors qu'il n'était censé n'y avoir ni gagnant ni perdant.
[8]
Dans la décision
Première nation des Mohawks d' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Mohawks d'Akwesasne
), le juge Lemieux cite avec approbation la mise en garde du protonotaire Lafrenière, en confirmant toutefois, au paragraphe 12, la règle générale voulant que, même si un règlement met fin au litige, des dépens peuvent être adjugés dans certaines circonstances:
La Cour peut toutefois adjuger des dépens en fonction de la conduite des parties pendant le litige, en se demandant par exemple (1) s'il était raisonnable pour une partie de soulever, poursuivre ou contester une allégation ou une question, (2) si une partie a poursuivi ou défendu une cause ou une allégation ou question particulière comme il convenait, (3) si une partie a exagéré ses prétentions ou soulevé une défense sans fondement et (4) si une partie a à juste titre concédé certains points ou abandonné des allégations au cours de la communication préalable (paragraphe 18).
À mon avis, on pourrait probablement appliquer facilement la règle générale dans le cas du règlement d'un différend commercial par exemple, mais il est extrêmement difficile, en pratique, de l'appliquer équitablement au règlement d'un différend sur la gouvernance au sein d'une Première Nation.
[9]
Un facteur peu commun milite toutefois en l'espèce en faveur du règlement d'un tel différend: la volonté de respecter la valeur culturelle voulant que l'équilibre dans la collectivité soit rétabli. Compte tenu de ce principe supérieur, il ne serait pas opportun de faire se prolonger un tel litige après l'obtention d'un règlement par une demande de dépens, puisque le différend sur la gouvernance qui vient d'être réglé ne le serait alors plus, et l'équilibre ne serait pas recouvré.
[10]
Je suis donc d'avis qu'en raison de la nature particulière d'un différend sur la gouvernance concernant les Premières Nations, chaque partie devrait payer ses propres dépens après l'obtention d'un règlement, que ce soit par médiation ou au moyen de négociations directes, à moins qu'il n'existe une raison claire et sérieuse qui justifie l'adjudication de dépens. Comme l'a constaté la Cour dans la décision
Mohawks d'Akwesasne
, les raisons sérieuses peuvent être très variées: en effet, elles peuvent aller des actions déraisonnables et des erreurs commises au cours du litige jusqu'aux comportements répréhensibles et inacceptables.
II.
Application du critère au présent différend sur les dépens
[11]
Alors que les demandeurs ne sollicitent pas de dépens, les défendeurs demandent à la Cour leur adjuger des dépens sur une base de pleine indemnité, à savoir un montant de 531 236,44 $, au motif que l'avocate des demandeurs, en suivant les instructions de ses clients, se serait comportée de manière inacceptable et répréhensible pendant le déroulement du litige.
[12]
Les différends sur la gouvernance au sein des collectivités sont toujours importants, car les enjeux sont grands. Chaque partie à un différend est donc disposée à y consacrer beaucoup de temps, d'énergie et d'argent pour avoir gain de cause. La méthode utilisée devant une question particulière doit toutefois s'accompagner de choix réalistes. De prime abord, il peut sembler valoir la peine d'investir sans compter pour défendre une certaine position à l'égard d'une question donnée, et ce, sans une mûre réflexion sur la question de savoir si les coûts élevés qui y sont associés en valent la peine. Par la suite, la partie qui défend une position avec vigueur se heurte habituellement à une forte opposition, de sorte que le conflit persiste et les frais élevés qui y sont associés continuent de s'additionner. Souvent, on perd de vue le bien-être de la collectivité dans les choix qui sont faits. À mon avis, c'est ce qu'ont vécu les deux parties au présent différend avant qu'elles ne concluent l'entente, et je sais par expérience que cela n'a rien d'inhabituel.
[13]
Au vu des arguments présentés sur les dépens, j'estime qu'il existe trois facteurs pertinents dont il faut tenir compte pour parvenir à des conclusions à cet égard en l'espèce.
A.
Mesures de réparation sollicitées
[14]
Le principal argument avancé par les défendeurs à l'appui de leur demande de dépens a trait aux mesures de réparation sollicitées par les demandeurs dans le cadre de la présente demande:
[traduction]
(i) une déclaration, de la nature d'un
quo warranto
, portant que les défendeurs ont cessé d'être des conseillers de la bande des Mohawks de Wahta;
(ii) une ordonnance prévoyant la tenue rapide d'une élection partielle pour le choix du chef et des conseillers de la bande des Mohawks de Wahta, élection à laquelle le demandeur Blaine Commandant pourra poser sa candidature comme chef;
(iii) une ordonnance d'adjudication des dépens;
(iv) toute autre ordonnance qu'il semblera juste à l'honorable Cour de rendre.
[15]
Vu le résultat du scrutin tenu par suite d'une pétition et de son non-respect par les conseillers dont on a déjà parlé, on comprend aisément que l'objet premier de la présente demande était de faire déclarer par la Cour que, par suite de l'élection, les conseillers n'avaient plus le pouvoir de gouverner. En réponse à la demande, les conseillers défendeurs devaient démontrer qu'on ne pouvait se fonder sur le scrutin tenu par suite de la pétition pour rendre une ordonnance de destitution. Les défendeurs ont fait valoir à cette fin que le processus entourant la tenue d'un scrutin par pétition était entaché d'irrégularités. Par conséquent, la demande visait clairement la qualité de cette élection.
[16]
Les demandeurs n'ont toutefois pas uniquement cherché à obtenir la destitution des défendeurs dans la demande. Comme nous l'avons vu, la Première Nation n'a pas tenu d'élection partielle pour combler le poste vacant de chef, comme l'exige pourtant le Règlement sur les élections. Il appert que, si les demandeurs avaient obtenu la délivrance d'un
quo warranto
, ils auraient ensuite voulu obtenir la deuxième mesure de réparation sollicitée, une ordonnance prévoyant la tenue d'une élection partielle en vue de combler non seulement les postes des défendeurs mais aussi celui de chef qui était vacant. Or, il appert aussi à la lecture de la deuxième mesure sollicitée que la demande avait aussi comme objectif crucial de fournir à M. Commandant l'occasion de retrouver son poste de chef, et ce, en tentant de faire réviser et rectifier la décision - non contestée par voie de contrôle judiciaire - de le destituer.
[17]
M. Schindler, le précédent avocat des demandeurs, a rédigé et déposé la demande. Cherchant à faire réviser la destitution de M. Commandant, il a invoqué les motifs suivants, qui reposent sur l'affidavit déposé par M. Commandant à l'appui de la demande:
[traduction]
6. Le demandeur Blaine Commandant a été chef des Mohawks de Wahta sans interruption de 1999 au 27 octobre 2011. À cette dernière date, les défendeurs, agissant en tant que Conseil des Mohawks de Wahta, ont déclaré vacant le poste de chef au motif que le chef Commandant n'avait pas assisté à trois réunions consécutives du Conseil.
6. Le demandeur Blaine Commandant avait un motif valable pour ne pas assister aux trois réunions, et on ne l'a pas avisé de la résolution que le Conseil envisageait d'adopter en vue de déclarer vacant le poste de chef.
7. Le demandeur Blaine Commandant n'a pas alors demandé le contrôle judiciaire de la prétendue déclaration de vacance de son poste parce qu'il ne pouvait travailler avec les membres actuels du Conseil et que la destitution de ceux-ci était une condition préalable à toute tentative de sa part de réintégration ou de réélection comme chef des Mohawks de Wahta.
8. Les demandeurs se fondent sur les articles 18 (1) et 18.1 de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales.
Le passage suivant de l'affidavit du 15 juin 2012 de M. Commandant, déposé à l'appui de la demande, démontre clairement son intérêt dans la demande:
[traduction]
38. Agissant comme si la déclaration de vacance de mon poste de chef était valide, les défendeurs, agissant en tant que Conseil des Mohawks de Wahta, ont en janvier et en février 2012 informé, au moyen de bulletins, la collectivité de la tenue d'un scrutin le 21 avril 2012 pour le choix d'un chef. Ils ont toutefois informé la collectivité plus tard, le 12 avril 2012, soit après la date limite de dépôt des candidatures, que le scrutin prévu était annulé; aucune date n'a été fixée pour la tenue d'un nouveau scrutin.
39. Par conséquent, étant donné la prétendue vacance du poste de chef et la pétition publique destituant les quatre conseillers, il n'y a plus d'élu qui puisse prendre en charge les affaires de la collectivité avant la tenue d'une élection partielle pour désigner un chef et les conseillers.
40. Je suis prêt à assumer cette responsabilité en attendant la tenue de l'élection partielle requise, où je veux pouvoir me porter candidat. Pour ce motif, je soumets le présent affidavit au soutien d'une demande de déclaration portant que les postes des quatre conseillers élus en mars 2011 sont vacants et que ma prétendue destitution, découlant de la résolution du 27 octobre 2011, est nulle et sans effet. Je soumets aussi l'affidavit au soutien d'une demande d'ordonnance prévoyant la tenue, dès que les règles relatives aux élections le permettront, d'un nouveau scrutin en vue du choix d'un chef et de conseillers, et au soutien, à titre de mesure de réparation provisoire, d'une demande d'ordonnance interdisant aux quatre conseillers et à l'administrateur nommé par eux d'exercer un quelconque pouvoir lié à leur charge, tout en me confiant la responsabilité d'administrer les affaires des Mohawks de Wahta en attendant l'instruction de la demande.
[18]
Le 10 juillet 2012, M. Schindler a d'ailleurs déposé une requête en injonction visant à préserver les intérêts de M. Commandant et dans laquelle il sollicitait les mesures de réparation suivantes:
[traduction]
(i) une injonction interlocutoire interdisant aux défendeurs d'exercer tout pouvoir dévolu aux conseillers de la bande des Mohawks de Wahta, en attendant l'instruction de la présente demande ou la tenue de l'élection partielle pour le choix d'un chef et de conseillers de bande des Mohawks de Wahta, tel qu'il est demandé par les demandeurs;
(ii) une injonction prévoyant qu'en attendant l'instruction de la demande ou la tenue de cette élection partielle, le demandeur Blaine Commandant ait et exerce, à l'exclusion de toute autre personne, tous les pouvoirs dévolus au chef et aux conseillers de la bande des Mohawks de Wahta;
(iii) de manière subsidiaire, une ordonnance prévoyant, conformément à l'article 385 des Règles, l'instruction accélérée de la présente demande.
[19]
Une fois choisie pour remplacer M. Schindler, l'avocate actuelle des demandeurs a adopté la même position que son prédécesseur. Ainsi, dans leur mémoire des faits et du droit, daté du 28 février 2013 dont suit un extrait, les demandeurs reprennent quant au fond les mesures de réparation sollicitées dans la demande, notamment:
[traduction]
61. Les manquements à l'équité procédurale appellent la norme de contrôle de la décision correcte.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (juge Tremblay-Lamer), au paragraphe 37 (
Basil
).
62. Nous soutenons par conséquent que la Cour devrait examiner la question de savoir si la décision de déclarer le poste de chef vacant, sans respecter envers le chef Commandant les obligations en matière d'équité, était correcte. La Cour devrait aussi examiner la question de savoir si la décision d'annuler la tenue de l'élection partielle spéciale pour pouvoir étudier la question du degré de sang requis par le
Citizenship Code
(le code de la citoyenneté) était correcte. Ces deux questions mettent en cause l'application des
January 2011 Election Regulations
(le règlement de 2011 sur les élections).
[20]
Toutefois, juste avant l'instruction de la présente demande, l'avocate des demandeurs a informé la Cour et l'avocat des défendeurs de ce qui suit, par lettre datée du 10 octobre 2013:
[traduction]
Les dates prévues pour l'instruction de l'affaire sont le mardi 15 octobre 2013 et le mercredi 16 octobre 2013. Veuillez noter que les demandeurs ne solliciteront que les mesures de réparation exposées dans l'avis de demande, soit une déclaration de la nature d'un bref de
quo warranto
. Bien que les autres questions soulevées dans le mémoire des demandeurs inscrivent en contexte les mesures de réparation demandées, nous ne solliciterons aucune autre mesure que celles décrites précédemment.
Le 11 octobre, un avis de suivi a été envoyé:
[traduction]
Comme suite à ma lettre d'hier, veuillez noter, par souci de clarté, que les demandeurs ne solliciteront que les mesures de réparation exposées dans l'avis de demande, à savoir une déclaration de la nature d'un bref de
quo warranto
et une ordonnance prévoyant la tenue rapide d'une élection partielle pour combler les postes de chef et de conseillers de la bande des Mohawks de Wahta. Je m'excuse de tout malentendu.
Dans son affidavit sur la question des dépens souscrit le 15 janvier 2014, Mme Hensell, l'avocate des demandeurs, a formulé les explications suivantes au sujet du deuxième avis:
[traduction]
20. Pendant le déroulement de la procédure de demande, nos clients ont convenu de ne plus demander l'examen de l'admissibilité de M. Commandant comme candidat au poste de chef. Il est normal d'apporter de telles modifications mineures aux mesures de réparation demandées au cours de l'instance, et ces modifications ne constituent pas un changement de position de nos clients aux fins de la présente demande.
[21]
Toutefois, étant donné l'importance qu'a toujours eue la prétention concernant la candidature dans le cadre de la présente demande, en ce qui a trait notamment à l'objectif de M. Commandant, je ne puis admettre que l'abandon de cette prétention constitue une [traduction] « modification mineure ».
[22]
Les prétentions présentées par M. Schindler, que l'actuelle avocate des demandeurs a continué de faire valoir, soulèvent de graves problèmes restés sans réponse.
[23]
Sauf avec l'autorisation de la Cour, une demande de contrôle judiciaire ne peut, aux termes de l'article 302 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
, avoir trait qu'à une seule décision ou action. Or, on sollicite dans la présente demande plusieurs mesures de réparation qui s'entrecroisent et qui mettent en cause un certain nombre de décisions et d'actions distinctes: la destitution de M. Commandant par les conseillers; le défaut de M. Commandant de s'opposer à cette destitution par voie de contrôle judiciaire; le défaut des conseillers de tenir une élection partielle pour combler le poste de chef; la tenue d'un scrutin par pétition; le résultat de ce scrutin; le non-respect de ce résultat par les conseillers; les efforts de M. Commandant en vue de recouvrer sa fonction de chef, bien que le Règlement sur les élections ne l'y autorise pas.
[24]
Sous le régime de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
, la Cour a compétence, en vertu de l'alinéa 18(1)
a
), pour statuer sur le droit des conseillers de demeurer en poste et, en vertu de l'alinéa 18.1(3)
a
), pour ordonner la tenue d'une élection partielle lorsque les circonstances le justifient. La Cour n'a toutefois pas compétence pour déclarer que M. Commandant [traduction] « peut se porter candidat » (la prétention concernant la candidature). Seul le Règlement sur les élections de la Première Nation peut prévoir les qualifications requises pour qu'une personne puisse se porter candidat à une élection de la Première Nation des Mohawks de Wahta. De plus, comme M. Commandant a été destitué du poste de chef en octobre 2011, il ne pouvait, en vertu de l'alinéa II
f
) du Règlement sur les élections, se porter candidat pendant les trois années suivant cette destitution.
[25]
L'actuelle avocate des demandeurs et l'avocat des défendeurs auraient dû immédiatement repérer les problèmes soulevés par les demandes formulées par M. Schindler. Or, cela ne semble pas s'être produit parce que ni l'un ni l'autre n'a pris des mesures en ce sens pendant le long litige en limitant les prétentions, par exemple par le retrait de celle concernant la candidature par les demandeurs, ou par une requête en annulation de cette demande présentée par les défendeurs.
[26]
À mon avis, le comportement des deux parties dans le cadre de la présente demande a fait gonfler le coût de la procédure bien au-delà de la normale et des limites que je considère comme raisonnables, et j'en attribue la responsabilité en parts égales aux deux parties.
[27]
Quoi qu'il en soit, je souscris à l'argument de l'avocat des défendeurs selon lequel beaucoup d'efforts ont dû être déployés pour contrer la tentative de M. Commandant de recouvrer son poste de chef. Je conclus que les demandeurs ont eu tort de poursuivre cet objectif, et que son abandon ne constitue pas un correctif approprié. Dans l'extrait de la décision
Mohawks d'Akwesasne,
précitée, reproduit précédemment, la Cour assimile cette erreur à une circonstance pouvant justifier l'adjudication des dépens. En effet, la Cour peut chercher à savoir « s'il était raisonnable pour une partie de soulever, poursuivre ou contester une allégation ou une question ». Je conclus qu'il existe donc une raison claire et sérieuse d'adjuger des dépens aux défendeurs pour les indemniser dans une certaine mesure des frais qu'ils ont dû inutilement engager au regard de cette question.
B.
Conflit d'intérêts
[28]
La deuxième question soulevée quant aux dépens vient de la crainte alléguée par les défendeurs d'un conflit d'intérêts. Cette peur découlerait du fait que M. Schindler a représenté la Première Nation dans le passé et que, puisqu'il a déposé la présente demande et représenté les demandeurs contre le gouvernement actuel de la Première Nation, il a pu utiliser à mauvais escient certains renseignements confidentiels obtenus comme avocat de la Première Nation dans le cadre de la présente demande. Malgré les sérieuses assurances données par M. Schindler et par l'avocate qui le remplace auprès des demandeurs pour dissiper toute inquiétude à ce sujet, les défendeurs continuent d'insister fortement sur ce point.
[29]
La protonotaire Milczynski a finalement mis un terme au profond différend sur ce point par une ordonnance rendue sous toutes réserves le 4 février 2013, où aucune conclusion n'était tirée quant à l'existence dans les faits ou selon droit d'un conflit d'intérêts, ou quant à la pertinence de la crainte alléguée en regard de la demande. En l'absence de telles conclusions, je ne crois pas possible de reprocher aux demandeurs de s'être opposés avec vigueur à la position défendue avec une telle intransigeance par les défendeurs. Je conclus qu'il n'existe pas de raison claire et sérieuse d'adjuger des dépens à l'égard de cette question.
C.
Volonté de recourir à la médiation
[30]
Quant au défaut des parties de convenir tôt de soumettre la demande à la médiation, on ne peut jeter aucun blâme qui justifierait l'octroi de dépens. La médiation peut être effectuée lorsque les parties sont disposées à y recourir. Quoique la Cour soit entièrement favorable à la médiation à la première occasion, si l'on ne peut y recourir alors, elle garde espoir que les parties pourront le faire plus tard lorsqu'elles seront prêtes.
[31]
L'expérience enseigne qu'à un certain moment les parties à un différend sur la gouvernance peuvent être disposées à s'asseoir à la même table et à régler leur différend. On doit choisir ce moment avec soin pour parvenir à un règlement. Lorsqu'on gravit les marches du palais de justice pour aller assister à une audience, cela nous fait habituellement bien saisir qu'un étranger, un juge qui ignore les choses que sait chacune des parties, va bientôt décider de ce qu'elles-mêmes auraient pu décider précédemment. Ce qui vient alors clairement à l'esprit, d'habitude, c'est la crainte de perdre le litige plutôt que l'espoir d'avoir gain de cause. Aussi, se faire rappeler que seul le pouvoir conféré par la bonne foi, plutôt que les récriminations, permettra d'arriver à un résultat juste peut ouvrir la porte de sortie d'un litige qui, pendant si longtemps, constituait la pénible réalité. Tout cela fait émerger un moment opportun pour trouver une solution adaptée aux parties. Cela s'est produit en l'espèce lors de l'instruction de la demande.
[32]
Je conclus qu'il n'existe pas de raison claire et sérieuse d'adjuger des dépens à l'égard de cette question.
III.
Adjudication des dépens
[33]
Comme élément de l'argumentation des défendeurs sur la question des dépens, leur avocat a produit un mémoire de dépens, daté du 21 novembre 2013, faisant état de dépens admissibles réclamés au titre de la colonne V du tarif B des
Règles des Cours fédérales
ainsi que de frais pour l'indemnisation [traduction] « entière », « substantielle » et « partielle » réclamés pour la réponse à toutes les questions soulevées dans la demande. Je tire trois conclusions après examen du mémoire de dépens: seuls les frais pour l'indemnisation [traduction] « partielle » de 224 080 $ réclamés sont raisonnables; s'attaquer aux difficultés soulevées par l'objectif poursuivi par les demandeurs en vue de permettre à M. Commandant de recouvrer son poste de chef a occasionné environ la moitié des frais d'indemnisation réclamés par les défendeurs; par conséquent, on pourrait évaluer à 112 040 $ les frais d'indemnisation imputables à la prétention concernant la candidature. Compte tenu de ma conclusion selon laquelle on peut tenir les deux parties également responsables de l'accroissement du coût du litige, j'estime juste et équitable d'accorder aux défendeurs un montant forfaitaire de 56 020 $.
IV.
Conclusion
[34]
J'espère sincèrement que la présente décision sur les dépens mettra fin au litige. J'encourage les demandeurs et les défendeurs à se concentrer sur l'avenir qu'ils ont pris tant de soin à tracer en concluant la très importante entente mettant un terme à la demande. Tous mes souhaits de réussite accompagnent les efforts qu'ils pourront déployer en ce sens.

 I.  
 Introduction  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] 
   
 Noël, J. 
  [Translation]: This is an application for judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001 c 27 (IRPA) of a decision dated February 21, 2013, by a member of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), that the applicant is not a Convention refugee for the purposes of section 96 of the IRPA or a person in need of protection under section 97 of that same Act.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II.  
 Facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The applicant, a citizen of Bangladesh, is married and the father of two children.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The applicant is an active member of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), a political party that is the fierce political rival of another party, the Awami League (AL). He joined the BNP in 1992 as a general member of the 89th Ward Unit in the city of Dhaka, and became vice-president of that Ward Unit in 1996. Over time, the applicant became increasingly active and popular within the organization.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  Tensions between the two parties, which alternate in power in Parliament, increased over time such that the applicant was allegedly the victim of many violent incidents because of his political affiliation and activities and his opposition to the AL.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  The applicant left Bangladesh in March 2006 to settle in the United States on a visa. He lived there illegally for five years.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  In July 2006, his wife and children, still in Bangladesh, were purportedly forced to leave their family home to go to live in another village, Kalabaga. Subsequently his wife apparently received death threats from members of the AL when she returned to visit their house in August 2006 and January 2011.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  The applicant left the United States on June 2, 2011, to claim refugee protection in Canada on the grounds that he would have a well-founded fear of persecution in Bangladesh by members of the AL, that is, by the governing party, toward which he had expressed fierce opposition.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III.  
 Decision under review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The RPD stated at the outset that it was satisfied as to the applicant's identity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  The RPD rejected the applicant's claim for two reasons: first, because it did not find him credible, and second, because it found that there was an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Bangladesh.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  In the first place, the RPD found that important parts of the applicant's account were neither credible nor plausible. The applicant stated that he held an important position within the BNP, and yet others who also held prominent positions within the party were not victims of violence or threats and continue to be BNP militants without having to flee Bangladesh. The applicant said that he was more openly critical than his colleagues and that he was targeted more by the AL because he recruited a lot of members for the BNP, both of which reasons the RPD characterized as unlikely. The RPD indicated that, since the applicant left the country in 2006 and has been totally absent from the local political scene since then, it is unlikely that he would be sought and threatened by the AL. The applicant also asserted that the police are seeking his arrest for charges dating back to 2000, and that a death threat was made against him in 2009, but the RPD did not find his testimony credible on this point. He also stated that his spouse received death threats from members of the AL when she visited the family home. The RPD characterized that statement as a fabrication because such a thing was unlikely to have occurred as the applicant's spouse and children had moved permanently to Kalabaga.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  Furthermore, the RPD questioned some key elements of the applicant's evidence, pointing to contradictions therein with respect to when the applicant joined the BNP. It also rejected several pieces of evidence on the basis of a document from the Bangladesh National Documentation Package that states that certain official documents from that country may be false.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  The RPD stated that the applicant resided in the United States for five years without claiming refugee status there and that he therefore has no subjective fear of persecution in Bangladesh.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  Second, the RPD found that there was an IFA in Bangladesh where the applicant could live without fear of persecution because he was threatened only in the 89th Ward. According to the RPD, the applicant's spouse and children were never threatened in Kalabaga and the applicant could join them there without any problem. Thus, it would not be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh to require the applicant to avail himself of an IFA before claiming refugee status in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Finally, the RPD found that the applicant did not have a subjective fear of persecution at the time that he left Bangladesh. It added that, on a balance of probabilities, the applicant would not be faced, if he were to return to Bangladesh, with a reasonable chance or a serious possibility of persecution or with a risk of torture or a threat to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 Arguments of the applicant  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The applicant is of the opinion that the RPD's decision is unreasonable for four reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  First, the RPD erred in dealing with the evidence. It failed to take into consideration essential documents, in particular a newspaper article that directly contradicts its findings that other high-ranking leaders of the BNP were never victims of violence. Furthermore, the RPD made no comment on evidence that contradicts its findings, in particular with respect to the applicant's political activities within the BNP.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Second, the RPD found that some of the documents submitted in evidence by the applicant were false, but it did not indicate why it was rejecting those specific documents. Yet the RPD had an obligation to provide reasons for that blanket rejection. It was also required to provide the applicant with an opportunity to be heard on this point. Moreover, the RPD may only reject official documents if it has serious grounds for doing so.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  Third, the RPD erred in concluding that there was an IFA in Bangladesh because it failed to take into account either the applicant's level of participation in the BNP from Canada or documents indicating that people may be the subject of false charges, and because it failed to consider the whole of the evidence concerning the applicant, including the fact that his passport has expired and that he is politically active in Canada. Moreover, the applicant explained in his testimony why he could not simply move elsewhere in the country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  Fourth, regarding the risk of persecution, the RPD should have taken into consideration the fact that the applicant is associated with the BNP and an opponent of the AL, the party currently in power, and it should have done so even if it did not believe the allegations of persecution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V.  
 Arguments of the respondent  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  The respondent maintains that the RPD's decision is reasonable and that the Court's intervention is not warranted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  The respondent began by stating that the mere fact that the applicant lived in the United States for five years without claiming refugee status there constitutes a fatal error that justifies the dismissal of his application herein. The respondent added the following arguments, however.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  First, the RPD did not fail to consider essential documentation because it is presumed to have looked at all of the evidence submitted, and the fact that it did not refer to each item of evidence does not vitiate its decision. Furthermore, the document relied on by the applicant contradicts his own words as the RPD summarized the essential points of his testimony in its decision. That is to say that, in his testimony, the applicant himself did not refer to the content of the newspaper article.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Second, regarding the applicant's argument concerning the existence of an IFA in Bangladesh, the RPD's reasons clearly state that it took into account the applicant's allegations but did not find them credible, in particular because he had not been in the country since 2006 and he was no longer politically active there.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  Third, the RPD did not have to assess new risks in support of the claim, that is, the fact that the applicant's passport has expired and that he is politically active in Canada. Those risks do not appear in the applicant's Personal Information Form (PIF).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Fourth, the RPD did in fact provide reasons for refusing to give any probative value to certain pieces of evidence as it clearly stated in its reasons that it based its decision on a review of the documentary evidence. Furthermore, contrary to what the applicant claims, the RPD was not required to raise this issue at the hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VI.  
 Reply memorandum  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  With respect to the RPD's alleged failure to take into account certain documents, the applicant reiterates that the RPD made no comment regarding the article relied on and that by failing to take into account that article and the applicant's testimony at the hearing the RPD distorted the evidence on which one of its most important implausibility findings is based, that is, the finding that the applicant cannot alone have been targeted by the AL while other members of the BNP, who were more prominent than he, were not. Furthermore, the applicant rejects the findings of implausibility and argues that the RPD should have informed him of the contradictions it noted so as to give him the opportunity to respond to them.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Regarding the existence of the IFA, the RPD could not have made such a finding if it had consulted all of the evidence, since the evidence shows that, among other things, opposition party members can be the subject of false charges and that such charges are national in scope. This suggests that the RPD did not take all of the evidence into consideration.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  Regarding the RPD's obligation to assess all of the reasons related to risk in the event of the applicant's return to Bangladesh, the RPD found that the applicant did not have a subjective fear at the time that he left the country, whereas it should have considered the extent of his subjective fear at the time of the hearing, given the new circumstances.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VII.  
 Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  The parties' arguments raise two issues:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Did the RPD err in its findings regarding the applicant's credibility and in its assessment of the evidence?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Did the RPD err in finding that there was an IFA in Bangladesh?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VIII.  
 Standard of review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  The RPD's findings concerning the applicant's credibility and its assessment of the evidence in the case require deference and must be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 315). The issue of the existence of an IFA in Bangladesh constitutes a question of fact that must therefore also be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IX.  
 Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 A.  
 Did the RPD err in its findings regarding the applicant's credibility and in its assessment of the evidence?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  The RPD's decision is unreasonable and the matter must be referred back to the decision-maker for redetermination on account of the assessment therein of the evidence. The errors made by the RPD in its analysis of the evidence are so significant and so numerous that they warrant the intervention of the Court. In fact, the erroneous assessment of the evidence constitutes, in part, the basis of the RPD's findings with respect to the lack of credibility or plausibility in the applicant's statements.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  In its decision, the RPD called the applicant's credibility into question by dwelling on the unlikelihood that he was the subject of violence and threats because other prominent members of the BNP, including the president of the party in the applicant's ward, are still active in Bangladesh and have never had reason to flee the country (see RPD's decision at para 17). That finding cannot stand for two reasons. First, it would be completely unreasonable to find that the applicant had no reason to leave his country of origin simply because other people, who perhaps could have left, have remained there. Second, the RPD reached this conclusion by disregarding an important piece of evidence in the record that shows that the political context in the country and the political allegiances of the applicant and the other members of the BNP put them in serious danger. Indeed, according to a newspaper article filed as Exhibit C-24, the validity of which is not questioned by the RPD, the president of the BNP in the applicant's ward was attacked and so seriously injured that he had to be hospitalized. After reading this article, it is difficult to understand how the RPD was able to find that this person had no reason to flee Bangladesh. This error in the assessment of the evidence led to an unreasonable finding that the applicant lacked credibility. Furthermore, the evidence shows that other BNP leaders left the country as a result of their political activity (see Tribunal Record, page 163).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  Further on, the RPD goes as far as to state that the applicant "acknowledged that the other leaders [of the BNP] . . . were never the object of threats to their lives" (see RPD's decision at paragraph 19). Yet a reading of the hearing transcript indicates that the applicant never made such a statement. Certainly, the issue of the fate of the other prominent members of the party was addressed at the hearing, but the applicant stated that, unlike other members, his life had come under  
 direct 
  attack. This finding by the RPD is therefore not consistent with the applicant's testimony and is unreasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  The RPD found at paragraph 18 of its decision that there was "a lack of plausibility with respect to principal aspects of the claimant's evidence." Given this wording, this Court must find that the RPD gave significant weight to the finding that followed this phrase. That finding is unfounded, however. The RPD perceived what it considered a contradiction between the information provided on the applicant's PIF and that provided on his claim for protection form (CPF). The applicant allegedly stated that he joined the BNP in two different years: 1992 on his PIF and 1996 on his CPF. However, the applicant's CPF specifies that he was a vice-president starting in 1996, which in no way contradicts the other information in the record. This error in the assessment of the evidence as well as the resulting finding are unreasonable, especially given the importance the RPD attached to this finding and considering its consequences for the applicant, whose claim is in large part based on his political activities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  In paragraph 24 of its decision, the RPD addresses Exhibit C-11, a newspaper article from 2001 that reports a violent incident between the BNP and the AL. The RPD found that, since members of both parties were injured, "this is not a situation where the claimant was targeted." However, the article is not one that illustrates in a general manner the violence between the two parties: the applicant is mentioned in the article as one of the injured who are named. The RPD therefore erred in its assessment of that piece of evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  The RPD pursued its reasoning by relying on the Bangladesh National Documentation Package, which it cited in noting that the country had returned to democratic rule in 2009, that previously flouted constitutional rights had been restored, and that the elected government had made a commitment to address a number of serious human rights problems. As the applicant rightly observed in his memorandum of fact and law, one cannot but conclude that the RPD likely cherry-picked the excerpts that it wished to rely on because, in the same paragraph as the one it cited, the following appears: "[y]et extrajudicial executions, custodial torture, and impunity for members of the security forces continue." The RPD cannot split the evidence by extracting the passages that support its conclusion and not even mention the rest ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 912; see also  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  61 ACWS (3d) 769).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  Moreover, again according to the national documentation before the RPD, political violence has increased since the AL has come into power, and supporters of the opposition party (BNP) are harassed by supporters of the governing party. The documentation also states that there were 220 deaths and some 14,000 injured in connection with political violence in 2010 alone.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [38] 
  In that respect, it is very clear and has long been recognized by the courts that an administrative decision-maker is not required to refer to every piece of evidence before him or her. Such an obligation would be an excessive burden for decision-makers, whose workload is already heavy. However, administrative decision-makers, in this case the RPD, must nevertheless demonstrate that they engaged in the exercise of a general weighing of all of the evidence. The more the evidence that is not mentioned or analyzed is important in light of the circumstances in the case, the more willing a court, like this Court, may be to infer that the decision-maker made an erroneous finding of fact by not taking into account the evidence before it ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 35 ( 
 Cepeda-Gutierrez 
 ), see for example  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 189).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] 
  Furthermore, in the case at bar, I am of the opinion that the RPD was required to at least acknowledge the existence of evidence contrary to its own conclusions ( 
 Cepeda- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 17). If one is to go by the RPD's reasoning, Bangladesh has returned to democratic rule and the legal system is working efficiently. The RPD made no reference to the significant political violence that continues to exist, even though this is a central point and one that is absolutely essential to dealing with the claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [40] 
  Finally, I am also of the view that the RPD erred by rejecting en bloc, as it did, certain evidence submitted by the applicant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2005] FCJ No 831). The RPD cited a document from the Bangladesh National Documentation Package (the  
 Country of Origin Information Report 
 ) according to which official documents from that country may be false, and then it rejected a series of pieces of evidence on the basis of that passage alone. The RPD did not indicate why it rejected those specific documents. Why those and not others? Even though the document cited cautions the RPD about the existence of falsified documents, it does not authorize the RPD to systematically reject evidence on the sole basis that it comes from that country. In accepting certain documents from Bangladesh and rejecting others, the RPD did not explain its rationale for doing so. In that context, it was incumbent upon it to explain, if only summarily, the general nature of the distinctions made.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [41] 
  However, the respondent argues, and rightly so, that the applicant lived illegally in the United States for five years before moving to Canada and claiming refugee status here. Although this element could have been fatal to the claim at the heart of this judicial review, I am of the view that the decision is nevertheless unreasonable because of the large number of errors committed by the RPD in its assessment of the evidence and the gravity of those errors, which form the basis of the RPD's findings with respect to the applicant's lack of credibility. All of these errors seriously taint the RPD's reasoning so that the decision cannot stand, and the matter must therefore be referred back to the RPD for redetermination. Given the deficiencies of the decision as regards the applicant's credibility, it could be the case that, if the RPD were to look at the case as a whole from a different perspective, the analysis concerning the applicant's five-year stay in the United States might lead to a different finding.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 B.  
 Did the RPD err in finding that there was an IFA in Bangladesh?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [42] 
  Given the answer to the first question and the resultant order that the decision be set aside, there is no need for the Court to answer the second question. On the whole, the RPD carried out an unreasonable assessment of the evidence in this case, including the evidence that led it to find that there is an IFA in Bangladesh. Consequently, the RPD's finding in that regard cannot be valid and the matter must be redetermined by the RPD.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [43] 
  As a result, for the above-stated reasons, I am of the view that the RPD's decision is unreasonable and that the matter must be referred back to the decision-maker for redetermination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [44] 
  The parties were invited to submit a question for certification, but none was submitted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 ORDER  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [45] 
   
 THE COURT ORDERS that 
  this application for judicial review is allowed and that the matter be referred to another member of the RPD for redetermination. No question is certified.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Le juge Noël 
 : Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la  
 Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés 
 , LC 2001, ch 27 [LIPR] à l'encontre de la décision rendue le 21 février 2013 par un commissaire de la Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR] de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada [CISR], dans laquelle on concluait que le demandeur n'est ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention pour l'application de l'article 96 de la LIPR, ni une personne à protéger selon l'article 97 de cette même loi.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II.  
 Faits  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Le demandeur est un citoyen du Bangladesh, marié et père de deux enfants.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Le demandeur est un membre actif du Bangladesh Nationalist Party [BNP], parti politique qui entretient une grande rivalité politique avec un autre parti, l'Awami League [AL]. Il s'est joint au BNP en 1992 en tant que membre général de l'unité du 89e quartier ( 
 ward 
 , en anglais), dans la ville de Dhaka, et il est devenu vice-président de cette unité de quartier en 1996. Au fil du temps, le demandeur est devenu de plus en plus actif et populaire au sein de l'organisation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  Les tensions entre les deux partis, qui s'échangent le pouvoir au Parlement, se sont accrues avec le temps, de telle sorte que le demandeur aurait été victime de nombreux épisodes de violence en raison de son appartenance et de ses activités politiques ainsi que de son opposition à l'AL.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Le demandeur a quitté le Bangladesh en mars 2006 pour aller s'établir aux États-Unis au titre d'un visa, où il a habité illégalement pendant cinq ans.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  En juillet 2006, sa femme et ses enfants, toujours au Bangladesh, auraient été contraints de quitter la résidence familiale pour aller vivre dans un autre village, Kalabaga. Sa femme aurait par la suite reçu des menaces de mort de la part de membres de l'AL, alors qu'elle était retournée visiter la maison en août 2006 et en janvier 2011.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Le demandeur a quitté les États-Unis le 2 juin 2011 pour demander l'asile au Canada au motif qu'il aurait une crainte justifiée d'être persécuté au Bangladesh par des membres de l'AL, c'est-à-dire du parti au pouvoir à l'égard duquel il a manifesté une vive opposition.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III.  
 Décision contestée  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  D'emblée, la SPR s'est dite convaincue quant à l'identité du demandeur.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  La SPR a rejeté la demande du demandeur pour deux motifs, d'une part parce qu'elle ne l'a pas trouvé crédible, d'autre part parce qu'elle a conclu à l'existence d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur [PRI] au Bangladesh.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Premièrement, la SPR a conclu que d'importants pans du récit du demandeur n'étaient ni crédibles ni plausibles. Le demandeur affirmait occuper un poste important au sein du BNP, alors que d'autres personnes qui, elles aussi, occupaient des postes d'envergure au sein du parti n'ont pas été victimes de violence ou de menaces et continuent à militer pour le BNP sans avoir à fuir le Bangladesh. Le demandeur a indiqué qu'il était plus ouvertement critique que ses collègues et qu'il était ciblé davantage par l'AL parce qu'il recrutait beaucoup de membres pour le BNP, deux motifs que la SPR a qualifiés de peu probables. La SPR a indiqué que, puisque le demandeur a quitté le pays en 2006 et qu'il est totalement absent de la scène politique locale depuis ce temps, il est peu probable qu'il fasse l'objet de recherches et de menaces de la part de l'AL. Le demandeur a également fait valoir que la police cherche à l'arrêter pour des accusations datant de 2000, et qu'il a été menacé de mort en 2009, mais la SPR n'a pas jugé son témoignage crédible sur ce point. Il a de plus indiqué que son épouse a fait l'objet de menaces de mort de la part de membres de l'AL au moment où elle visitait la maison familiale. La SPR a qualifié cette allégation de fabrication puisqu'il était peu probable qu'une telle situation survienne alors que l'épouse du demandeur et ses enfants avaient déménagé en permanence à Kalabaga.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  De plus, la SPR a mis en doute certains éléments importants de la preuve du demandeur, en y relevant des contradictions quant au moment auquel le demandeur a joint les rangs du BNP. Elle a également écarté plusieurs éléments de preuve en s'appuyant sur un document du cartable national de documentation sur le Bangladesh rapportant que certains documents officiels de ce pays peuvent être faux.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  La SPR a précisé que le demandeur a résidé aux États-Unis pendant cinq ans sans y demander le statut de réfugié et qu'il n'a donc pas de crainte subjective d'être persécuté au Bangladesh.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  Deuxièmement, la SPR a déterminé qu'il existait une PRI au Bangladesh où le demandeur pourrait aller vivre sans craindre d'être persécuté, puisqu'il n'était menacé que sur le territoire du 89e quartier. Selon la SPR, l'épouse du demandeur et ses enfants n'ont jamais été menacés à Kalabaga et le demandeur pourrait les y rejoindre sans problème. Ainsi, il ne serait pas objectivement déraisonnable ou indûment sévère d'exiger du demandeur qu'il se prévale d'une PRI avant de réclamer le statut de réfugié au Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Ultimement, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas de crainte subjective d'être persécuté au moment où il a quitté le Bangladesh. Elle a ajouté que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le demandeur serait exposé, s'il devait retourner au Bangladesh, ni à une chance raisonnable ou à une sérieuse possibilité de persécution, ni à un risque de torture ou à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou de peines cruels ou inusités.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 Arguments du demandeur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Le demandeur est d'avis que la décision de la SPR est déraisonnable pour quatre motifs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Premièrement, la SPR s'est mal appropriée la preuve. Elle a omis de prendre en considération de la documentation essentielle, notamment un article de journal qui contredit directement ses conclusions quant au fait que les autres hauts dirigeants du BNP n'ont jamais été victimes de violence. De plus, la SPR n'a pas commenté d'éléments de preuve qui contredisent ses conclusions, notamment au sujet de la participation politique du demandeur au sein du BNP.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Deuxièmement, la SPR a conclu que certains documents soumis en preuve par le demandeur constituaient de faux documents sans indiquer les raisons qui l'amenaient à rejeter ces documents en particulier. Pourtant, la SPR avait l'obligation de motiver ce rejet en bloc. Elle devait en outre offrir au demandeur la possibilité d'être entendu à ce sujet. De plus, la SPR ne peut rejeter des documents officiels à moins d'un motif sérieux.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  Troisièmement, la SPR a erronément conclu à l'existence d'une PRI au Bangladesh puisqu'elle n'a pas pris en considération le niveau de participation du demandeur au BNP depuis le Canada, qu'elle n'a pas tenu compte de la documentation faisant état de la possibilité pour les personnes de faire l'objet de fausses accusations et en oubliant d'examiner l'ensemble des éléments concernant le demandeur, y compris le fait que son passeport est expiré et qu'il est actif sur le plan politique au Canada. Qui plus est, le demandeur a expliqué dans son témoignage ce pour quoi il ne pouvait pas simplement déménager ailleurs au pays.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  Quatrièmement, pour ce qui est du risque de persécution, la SPR aurait dû tenir compte du fait que le demandeur est associé au BNP et un opposant à l'AL, parti actuellement au pouvoir, et ce, même si elle n'a pas cru les allégations de persécution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V.  
 Arguments du défendeur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Le défendeur soutient que la décision de la SPR est raisonnable et que l'intervention de la Cour n'est pas justifiée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  D'emblée, le défendeur indique que le simple fait pour le demandeur d'avoir vécu aux États-Unis pendant cinq ans sans y avoir demandé le statut de réfugié constitue une erreur fatale pour le demandeur qui justifie le rejet de la présente demande. Le défendeur ajoute toutefois les arguments énoncés ci-dessous.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  Premièrement, la SPR n'a pas omis de considérer de la documentation essentielle puisqu'elle est présumée s'être saisie de la totalité de la preuve présentée, et le fait de ne pas mentionner tous les éléments de preuve ne vicie pas sa décision. De plus, le document invoqué par le demandeur contredit les propos mêmes du demandeur puisque la SPR a résumé l'essentiel du témoignage de ce dernier dans sa décision. C'est donc dire que, dans son témoignage, le demandeur lui-même n'a pas rapporté le contenu de l'article de journal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Deuxièmement, pour ce qui est de l'argument du demandeur sur l'existence d'une PRI au Bangladesh, les motifs de la SPR indiquent clairement qu'elle a tenu compte des allégations du demandeur, mais ne les a pas jugées crédibles notamment parce que celui-ci n'était plus au pays depuis 2006 et qu'il n'y était plus actif sur le plan politique.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  Troisièmement, la SPR n'était pas tenue d'examiner de nouveaux risques à l'appui de la demande, soit le fait que le passeport du demandeur est expiré et que celui-ci est politiquement actif au Canada. En effet, ces risques ne figurent pas dans le Formulaire de renseignements personnels [FRP] du demandeur.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Quatrièmement, la SPR a bel et bien motivé les raisons pour lesquelles elle a refusé d'accorder toute force probante à certains éléments de preuve, puisqu'elle a clairement indiqué dans ses motifs qu'elle appuyait cette décision sur un examen de la preuve documentaire. De plus, contrairement à ce que prétend le demandeur, la SPR n'avait pas à soulever cet enjeu à l'audience.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VI.  
 Mémoire en réplique  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  Au sujet de la prétendue omission par la SPR de prendre en compte certains documents, le demandeur rappelle que le tribunal n'a pas commenté l'article invoqué et qu'en omettant de tenir compte de cet article et du témoignage du demandeur à l'audience, la SPR a perverti la preuve sur laquelle repose l'une de ses plus importantes conclusions d'invraisemblance, soit le fait que le demandeur ne peut lui seul avoir été visé par l'AL tandis que d'autres membres plus importants que lui du BNP n'ont pas été visés. De plus, le demandeur réfute les conclusions d'absence de vraisemblance et fait valoir que la SPR aurait dû informer le demandeur des contradictions qu'elle a relevées de manière à lui permettre d'y répondre.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Quant à l'existence de la PRI, la SPR n'aurait pas pu arriver à une telle conclusion si elle avait consulté l'ensemble de la preuve, puisque celle-ci indique, entre autres choses, que les membres du parti d'opposition peuvent faire l'objet de fausses accusations et que de telles accusations sont de portée nationale. Cela porte à croire que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte de toute la preuve.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  Pour ce qui est de l'obligation pour la SPR d'examiner tous les motifs liés au risque d'un éventuel retour au Bangladesh, la SPR a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas de crainte subjective au moment où il a quitté le pays, alors qu'elle aurait dû examiner l'étendue de sa crainte subjective au moment de l'audience, compte tenu des nouvelles circonstances.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VII.  
 Questions en litige  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  Les arguments des parties soulèvent deux questions en litige:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur dans ses conclusions relatives à la crédibilité du demandeur et dans son appréciation de la preuve?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant à l'existence d'une PRI au Bangladesh?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VIII.  
 Norme de contrôle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  Les conclusions de la SPR concernant la crédibilité du demandeur ou l'appréciation de la preuve au dossier commandent la déférence et doivent être contrôlées suivant la norme de la décision raisonnable ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 315). La question de l'existence d'une PRI au Bangladesh constitue une question de fait qui doit donc, elle aussi, être examinée sous la norme de la décision raisonnable ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IX.  
 Analyse  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 A.  
 La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur dans ses conclusions relatives à la crédibilité du 
   
 demandeur et dans son appréciation de la preuve?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  La décision de la SPR est déraisonnable et le dossier devra être renvoyé devant le décideur aux fins de réexamen en raison de l'appréciation de la preuve qui y est faite. Les erreurs commises par la SPR dans son analyse de la preuve sont si importantes et nombreuses qu'elles justifient l'intervention de la Cour. En effet, cette appréciation erronée de la preuve constitue, en partie, le fondement des conclusions de la SPR quant au manque de crédibilité ou de vraisemblance dans les propos du demandeur.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  Dans sa décision, la SPR remet en doute la crédibilité du demandeur en insistant sur le fait qu'il est peu probable que le demandeur ait fait l'objet de violence et de menaces puisque d'autres membres importants du BNP, dont le président du parti dans le quartier du demandeur, sont toujours actifs au Bangladesh et n'ont jamais eu de motif pour fuir le pays (voir la décision de la SPR au para 17). Cette conclusion ne saurait tenir, et ce, pour deux raisons. D'une part, il serait tout à fait déraisonnable de conclure que celui-ci n'a pas de raison de quitter son pays d'origine simplement parce que d'autres personnes, qui auraient peut-être pu partir, y sont restées. D'autre part, la SPR arrive à cette conclusion en faisant fi d'un important élément de preuve au dossier qui révèle que le contexte politique au pays et les allégeances politiques du demandeur et des autres membres du BNP les exposent à de graves dangers. En effet, selon un article de journal dont la validité n'est pas mise en doute par SPR, c'est-à-dire la pièce C-24, le président du PNB dans le quartier du demandeur a été attaqué et sérieusement blessé à un point tel qu'il a dû être hospitalisé. Après avoir lu cet article, il est difficile de comprendre la façon dont la SPR a pu conclure que cette personne n'avait pas eu de raison de fuir le Bangladesh. Cette erreur dans l'appréciation de la preuve a mené à une conclusion quant au manque de crédibilité du demandeur qui n'est pas raisonnable. De plus, la preuve révèle que d'autres dirigeants du PNB ont quitté le pays en conséquence de leur activité politique (voir Dossier du tribunal, p. 163).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  Plus loin, la SPR en rajoute et affirme que le demandeur aurait « [traduction] reconnu que d'autres dirigeants [du BNP] [...] n'ont jamais fait l'objet de menaces de mort. » (voir la décision de la SPR au para 19). Or, à la lecture de la transcription de l'audience, on constate que le demandeur n'a jamais formulé une telle assertion. Certes, la question du sort des autres membres importants du parti a été abordée à l'audience, mais le demandeur a affirmé que, contrairement à d'autres membres, il a subi, lui, une attaque  
 directe 
  à sa vie. Cette conclusion de la SPR n'est donc pas conforme au témoignage du demandeur et n'est pas raisonnable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  La SPR constate, au paragraphe 18 de sa décision, « [traduction] une absence de plausibilité en ce qui concerne les principaux aspects de la preuve du demandeur. » Étant donné la formulation de cette phrase, la présente Cour doit conclure que la SPR a accordé beaucoup de poids à la conclusion qui a suivi ce passage. Cette dernière n'est toutefois pas fondée. La SPR a perçu ce qu'elle considère être une contradiction entre les renseignements fournis dans le FRP et dans le Formulaire de demande d'asile du demandeur [FDA]. Ce dernier aurait affirmé avoir joint les rangs du BNP à deux années différentes, soit en 1992 dans son FRP et en 1996 dans son FDA. Cependant, le FDA du demandeur précise que celui-ci a occupé un poste de vice-président à partir de 1996, ce qui ne contredit en rien les autres renseignements au dossier. Cette erreur dans l'appréciation de la preuve ainsi que la conclusion qui en a découlé ne sont pas raisonnables surtout compte tenu de l'importance accordée à cette conclusion par la SPR et de la portée de celle-ci pour le demandeur, dont la demande s'appuie en majeure partie sur ses activités politiques.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  Au paragraphe 24 de sa décision, la SPR aborde l'élément de preuve C-11, un article de journal datant de 2001 qui témoigne d'un incident de violence entre le BNP et l'AL. La SPR conclut que, puisque des membres des deux partis ont été blessés, « [traduction] il ne s'agit pas d'une situation où le demandeur était visé. » Toutefois, il ne s'agit pas d'un article illustrant d'une manière générale la violence entre les deux partis: le demandeur figure dans l'article parmi les blessés nommés. La SPR a donc commis une erreur dans son appréciation de cet élément de preuve.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  La SPR poursuit son raisonnement en s'appuyant sur le cartable national de documentation du Bangladesh, qu'elle cite en indiquant que la démocratie a été réinstaurée au pays en 2009, que les droits constitutionnels auparavant bafoués ont été rétablis et que le gouvernement élu s'était engagé à régler divers problèmes majeurs en matière de droits de la personne. Comme l'a justement soulevé le demandeur dans son mémoire des faits et du droit, force est de constater que la SPR a vraisemblablement choisi les extraits qu'elle souhaitait retenir puisque, dans le même paragraphe qu'elle a cité, on retrouve le passage suivant: « [traduction] néanmoins, des gens sont toujours victimes d'exécutions extrajudiciaires et de torture pendant leur détention et les forces de l'ordre continuent à agir en toute impunité. » La SPR ne peut pas scinder la preuve pour en extraire les passages qui appuient ses propos sans même faire mention du reste ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 912; voir également 
 , 
   
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  61 ACWS (3d) 769).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  De plus, toujours selon la documentation nationale dont était saisie la SPR, la violence à caractère politique a augmenté depuis l'arrivée au pouvoir de l'AL, et les partisans du parti de l'opposition (BNP) font l'objet de harcèlement aux mains des partisans du parti au pouvoir. Cette documentation fait également état, pour 2010 seulement, de 220 décès et de quelques 14 000 blessés en lien avec la violence de nature politique.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [38] 
  À cet égard, il est bien évident et depuis longtemps reconnu par les tribunaux qu'un décideur administratif n'est pas tenu de commenter toute la preuve dont il est saisi. Une telle obligation représenterait un fardeau indu pour les décideurs dont la charge de travail est déjà élevée. Toutefois, les décideurs administratifs, en l'occurrence la SPR, doivent néanmoins montrer un exercice d'appréciation générale de toute la preuve. Plus la preuve qui n'est pas mentionnée ou analysée est importante vu les circonstances du dossier, plus une cour de justice, comme la présente Cour, peut être disposée à inférer que le décideur a tiré une conclusion de fait erronée en ne tenant pas compte de la preuve dont il disposait ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 35 [ 
 Cepeda-Gutierrez 
 ], voir par exemple  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] ACF no 189).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] 
  De plus, dans le cas qui nous préoccupe, je suis d'avis que la SPR devait au moins reconnaître l'existence de preuve allant à l'encontre de ses conclusions ( 
 Cepeda-Gutierrez 
 , précité, au para 17); si l'on se fie à son raisonnement, la démocratie est de retour au Bangladesh et le système juridique va rondement. La SPR ne fait aucune mention des grandes violences de nature politique qui persistent, bien qu'il s'agisse d'un point central et tout à fait essentiel au traitement de la demande.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [40] 
  Enfin, je suis également d'avis que la SPR a commis une erreur en rejetant en bloc des éléments de preuve présentés par le demandeur comme elle l'a fait ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2005] ACF no 831). La SPR cite un document tiré du cartable national de documentation sur le Bangladesh (le  
 Country of Origin Information Report 
 ) selon lequel des documents officiels issus de ce pays peuvent être faux, et elle rejette ensuite une série d'éléments de preuve en s'appuyant sur ce seul passage. La SPR ne donne aucune indication quant aux motifs qui l'ont mené à rejeter ces documents en particulier. Pourquoi ceux-là et pas d'autres? Bien que le document cité offre une mise en garde à la SPR sur l'existence de documents falsifiés, il ne l'autorise pas pour autant à rejeter systématiquement des éléments de preuve au seul motif qu'ils proviennent de ce pays. En retenant certains documents provenant du Bangladesh et en en rejetant d'autres, la SPR n'explique pas la raison d'être de ses choix. Dans ce contexte, elle se devait d'expliquer, ne serait-ce que sommairement, les grandes lignes des distinctions faites.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [41] 
  En revanche, le défendeur fait valoir, et ce, à bon droit, que le demandeur a vécu illégalement aux États-Unis pendant cinq ans avant de déménager au Canada et de demander le statut de réfugié ici. Quoique cet élément ait pu être fatal à la demande au cœur du présent contrôle judiciaire, je suis d'avis que la décision est néanmoins déraisonnable en raison du nombre élevé d'erreurs commises par la SPR dans son appréciation de la preuve et de la gravité de ces erreurs, lesquelles sous-tendent les conclusions de la SPR quant au manque de crédibilité du demandeur. Toutes ces erreurs entachent sérieusement le raisonnement de la SPR de telle sorte que la décision ne saurait tenir, et le dossier devra donc être renvoyé devant la SPR aux fins de réexamen. Étant données les lacunes de la décision touchant la crédibilité du demandeur, il se pourrait qu'en portant un regard différent sur l'ensemble du dossier l'analyse concernant le séjour de cinq ans du demandeur aux États-Unis puisse amener une différente conclusion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 B.  
 La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant à l'existence d'une PRI au Bangladesh?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [42] 
  Compte tenu de la réponse à la première question, qui ordonne l'annulation de la décision, il n'est pas nécessaire pour la Cour de répondre à la seconde. Dans l'ensemble, la SPR a réalisé un examen déraisonnable de la preuve dans le présent dossier, y compris en ce qui concerne les éléments de preuve qui l'ont menée à conclure à l'existence d'une PRI au Bangladesh. Par conséquent, la conclusion de la SPR à cet égard ne peut être valide et la question devra être examinée de nouveau par la SPR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [43] 
  Conséquemment, pour les motifs exposés ci-dessus, je suis d'avis que la décision de la SPR est déraisonnable et que le dossier doit être renvoyé devant le décideur aux fins de réexamen.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [44] 
  Les parties ont été invitées à présenter une question aux fins de certification, mais aucune question ne fut proposée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 ORDONNANCE  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [45] 
   
 LA COUR ORDONNE que 
  la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire soit accueillie et que le dossier soit renvoyé devant un autre membre de la SPR aux fins de réexamen. Aucune question n'est certifiée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

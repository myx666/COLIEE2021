 Dawson, J. 
 : Yadwinder Singh Sidhu was landed in Canada in August of 1995 as a permanent resident. Subsequently, he sponsored the applications for landing of his father, Ranjodh Singh, and his sister, Kiranjeet Kaur. Together, they bring this application for judicial review of the decision of a senior immigration officer refusing to land Mr. Singh and Ms. Kaur, and seek by way of mandamus an order that they be immediately landed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  While the Notice of Application filed on their behalf also put into issue the decision of an immigration officer which preceded the decision of the senior immigration officer, that claim was, on consent, abandoned at the hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 THE FACTS  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Mr. Sidhu was born in India, moved to the United States, and became a citizen of the United States in 1994. He then applied to immigrate to Canada and was granted permanent residence in August of 1995. Since then, Mr. Sidhu states that he has maintained two residences; one in Windsor, Ontario and one in Sterling Heights, Michigan. His wife, mother and children live in Michigan and his wife works in Michigan. Mr. Sidhu also works in Michigan.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  Mr. Sidhu says that because he knew that he was required to maintain a residence in Canada he rented a place in Windsor with friends, lived there during the week for most of the year, commuted to work in Michigan, and visited his family after work and on weekends and vacations. These assertions are not accepted by the Minister.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Mr. Sidhu says his plan upon immigrating to Canada was to sponsor his parents and siblings to immigrate, and that his plan was that when they were landed in Canada he would move his entire family to Canada from the United States.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  On April 6, 2000, the same day that his father and sister were arriving in Toronto from India, Mr. Sidhu was stopped from entering Canada at the Windsor border. An immigration officer issued a report pursuant to section 20 of the  
 Immigration Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 (" 
 Act 
 ") that in his opinion Mr. Sidhu was no longer a permanent resident of Canada because Mr. Sidhu had remained outside of Canada for more than 183 days. The report was forwarded to a senior immigration officer who issued a direction for inquiry and a direction for Mr. Sidhu to return to the United States.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Mr. Sidhu claims not to have received notice of a scheduled inquiry that he was to attend on July 14, 2000. He states that he has not been successful in obtaining another date for the inquiry.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  Kiranjeet Kaur and Ranjodh Singh arrived in Canada on April 6, 2000 with immigrant visas seeking landing as permanent residents. Immigration officials at that time decided to defer their landing interview until an investigation could be done as to whether or not Mr. Sidhu remained a permanent resident of Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  Kiranjeet Kaur and Ranjodh Singh sought leave and judicial review in this Court to review that decision, and on March 19, 2001 their application for judicial review was allowed and their cases returned to different immigration officials for determination as to whether or not they would be landed. The basis for allowing the application was that the immigration officials had not set a precise date for their re-examination, contrary to the  
 Act 
  and  
 Immigration Regulations, 1978 
  SOR/78-172 (" 
 Regulations 
 ").  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 201 F.T.R. 210; 2001 FCT 197 (T.D.).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  On June 19, 2001, Kiranjeet Kaur and Ranjodh Singh were interviewed by an immigration officer who prepared reports under subsection 20(1) of the  
 Act 
  based on his opinion that they were members of the inadmissible class of persons described in paragraph 19(2)(d) of the  
 Act 
  and section 12 of the Regulations. These reports were reviewed by a senior immigration officer who then directed an inquiry which was scheduled for August 28, 2001. This application for judicial review is brought in respect of the decision of the senior immigration officer to direct an inquiry.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  To date, no inquiry has been held and the Court was advised that the inquiry has been adjourned pending the outcome of this application for judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 THE ISSUES  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  The applicants raise two issues on this application:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Was the decision to refuse landing to Kiranjeet Kaur and Ranjodh Singh in error?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Was the duty of fairness breached in the manner by which a decision to refuse landing was made by the senior immigration officer?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  In response, the Minister raises the objection that remedies such as those sought on this application for judicial review ought not to be granted where there is an adequate, alternative remedy available to the applicants.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  The other relevant provision in the  
 Regulations 
  is section 12 which provides:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "12. An immigrant who has been issued a visa and who appears before an immigration officer at a port of entry for examination pursuant to subsection 12(1) of the Act is required  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 ANALYSIS  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  It is helpful to review the scheme set out in the  
 Act 
  and  
 Regulations 
  for the sponsorship of family members and their landing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  Subsection 2(1) in conjunction with subsection 5(2) of the  
 Regulations 
  allows Canadian citizens or permanent residents who meet certain requirements to sponsor an application for landing of a member of the family class.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  As to the admission of the sponsoree, section 9 of the  
 Act 
  requires an immigrant to apply for and obtain an immigrant's visa before appearing at a port of entry. Such applications are to be assessed by a visa officer, and where a visa officer is satisfied that it would not be contrary to the  
 Act 
  or  
 Regulations 
  to grant landing, the officer may issue a visa to the applicant to identify the applicant as a person who, in the opinion of the visa officer, meets the requirements of the  
 Act 
  and  
 Regulations 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  The holder of the immigrant visa then, pursuant to subsection 12(1) of the  
 Act 
 , presents himself or herself to an immigration officer at a port of entry for examination to determine whether the person is a person who may be granted admission.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  So that the immigration officer can determine if the person still meets the requirements of the  
 Act 
  and the  
 Regulations 
  at the time the person arrives at the port of entry, the person is, by section 12 of the  
 Regulations 
 , required to disclose all material facts changed since the issuance of the visa, or not disclosed at the time the visa was issued.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Under subsection 14(2) of the  
 Act 
 , where the immigration officer is satisfied that it would not be contrary to the  
 Act 
  or the  
 Regulations 
  to grant landing, the immigration officer shall either grant landing or authorize the immigrant to come into Canada on condition that the immigrant be present for further examination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  Under subsection 20(1) of the  
 Act 
 , where the immigration officer is of the opinion that it would, or may be, contrary to the  
 Act 
  or  
 Regulations 
  to grant admission, the immigration officer shall either report the person in writing to a senior immigration officer or allow the person to leave Canada forthwith.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Where a senior immigration officer receives such report, and is satisfied that it would not be contrary to the  
 Act 
  or  
 Regulations 
  to grant landing or otherwise authorize the immigrant to come into Canada, the senior immigration officer shall, pursuant to subsection 23(1) of the  
 Act 
 , either grant landing or authorize the immigrant to come into Canada for further examination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  Where, as in the present case, the senior immigration officer does not grant landing or allow the immigrant to enter pursuant to subsection 23(1), and does not make an exclusion order, paragraph 23(4.2)(a) of the  
 Act 
  requires the senior immigration officer to cause an inquiry to be held concerning the person as soon as is reasonably practicable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Section 31 of the  
 Act 
  requires an adjudicator conducting an inquiry to give a decision as soon as possible after an inquiry and where, in respect of a person who was seeking landing, the adjudicator is satisfied that it would not be contrary to the  
 Act 
  or  
 Regulations 
  to grant landing, the adjudicator shall grant landing as provided in paragraph 32(3)(a) of the  
 Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  Where the inquiry results in the issuance of a removal order or a conditional removal order, there is a right of appeal pursuant to paragraph 70(2)(b) of the  
 Act 
  to the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board ("Appeal Division").  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  On such appeal, the Appeal Division may either allow or dismiss the appeal, as provided for in subsection 73(1) of the  
 Act 
 . Where the appeal is allowed, subsection 74(1) allows the Appeal Division to make any removal order or conditional removal order that should have been made or to direct an examination as a person seeking entry at a port of entry.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  What emerges from this review is an understanding that sections 9, 12, 14, 20, 23, 31, 32, 70, 73 and 74 of the  
 Act 
  establish a complete procedure governing landing, including ultimately a right of appeal to the Appeal Division where landing is denied.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  It is a settled principle of law that remedies such as those sought on this application for judicial review ought not to be granted if the Court is satisfied that an adequate, alternative remedy is available to the applicant. See, for example,  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). The point is often expressed in terms that applicants ought to exhaust all statutory remedies before seeking judicial review, and reflects the discretionary and extraordinary nature of judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  In my view, in the present case the legislative provisions governing landing provide an adequate, alternative remedy to judicial review of the decision of the senior immigration officer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  In so concluding I have had regard to the following factors. The tenor of the  
 Adjudication Division Rules 
 , SOR/93-47 and the  
 Immigration Appeal Division Rules 
 , SOR/93-46 encourages the parties to proceed expeditiously. There is no suggestion that the process is costly, or in any event more costly than judicial review. An adjudicator has jurisdiction to grant landing, which is a remedy superior to that available on an application for judicial review, where the matter may well simply be remitted for redetermination. The final decision of the Appeal Division may be the subject of an application for leave and for judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  Declining, in the face of an adequate alternative remedy, to exercise the court's discretion at this juncture preserves the integrity of the process established by Parliament, reflects a proper and measured concern for the economic use of judicial resources, and ensures that if questions of law are ultimately to be decided by this Court on an application for judicial review the Court will have the benefit of reasons from the Appeal Division.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  For these reasons, the application for judicial review will be dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  Counsel for the applicants sought certification of a question in the following terms:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Is a senior immigration officer at a port of entry obliged to land holders of Family Class immigrant visas, where there has been an opinion by another immigration officer that the sponsor is no longer a permanent resident, and there has been no judicial or quasi-judicial determination of this issue? <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [37] 
  In view of the basis on which I have disposed of this application, it is not appropriate to certify the question posed or any similar question. This is an argument which should be addressed in the first instance to an adjudicator, and then, if necessary, to the Appeal Division.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [38] 
  In these circumstances the outstanding, but adjourned, inquiry should proceed expeditiously before the adjudicator.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 ORDER  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] 
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. No question is certified.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

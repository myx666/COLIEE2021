 This appeal was heard at Toronto, Ontario, on October 28, 2009, by Mandamin, J., of the Federal Court, who delivered the following reasons for judgment on November 12, 2009. 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
                                                                                                      
 
 
 
 [1] 
   
 Mandamin, J. 
 : Mr. Ding Yang (identified in the style of cause as Ding Yan) appeals the refusal of his citizenship application pursuant to subsection 14(5) of the  
 Citizenship Act 
  (" 
 Act 
 "), s. 18.1 of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
 , and rule 300 of the  
 Federal Court Rules 
 . 
 
 
 
 [2] 
  Mr. Yang contends the Citizenship Judge lost jurisdiction due to delay and/or because the Judge did not consider all the evidence demonstrating residency. Mr. Yang seeks as a remedy a declaration by this Court essentially confirming his entitlement to citizenship. 
 
 
 
 FACTS 
 
 
 
 [3] 
  Mr. Yang is 29 years old and from Hunan in the People's Republic of China. He first came to Canada on January 24, 1997 and he became a permanent resident on June 24, 2002. He applied to become a Canadian citizen on October 18, 2004. 
 
 
 
 [4] 
  The time period relevant to Mr. Yang's citizenship application is October 18, 2000 to October 18, 2004. As calculated under the 
  Act 
 , Mr. Yang was physically present in Canada 1059 days, 36 days short of the minimum 1095 days required in a four pear period. Mr. Yang was absent for family visits to China and sightseeing. 
 
 
 
 [5] 
  Mr. Yang sought to prove he established residence in Canada notwithstanding his absences. He had been married to a Canadian woman but later divorced. He entered into business relationships; he owned a condominium which he subsequently sold; and he was registered to study at York University. He even submitted documentation about being charged and convicted of summary offences, initially to show the convictions did not adversely affect his application but later submitting it also demonstrating residency. 
 
 
 
 [6] 
  The Citizenship Judge interviewed Mr. Yang on January 15, 2007. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Judge reserved his decision and requested more documentation. Mr. Yang submitted further information to the Citizenship Judge on January 15 and February 9, 2007. 
 
 
 
 DECISION UNDER APPEAL 
 
 
 
 [7] 
  On April 24, 2008, the Citizenship Judge issued the decision on Mr. Yang's application for citizenship. 
 
 
 
 [8] 
  The Citizenship Judge noted that Mr. Yang was short 36 days of the minimum 1095 days residency required during the four years preceding application. The Judge referred to Mr. Yang's acknowledgement that his application was dependent on the submission of additional documentation and stated Mr. Yang failed to provide the additional documents requested. Finally, some of the documents did not relate to the relevant time period. 
 
 
 
 [9] 
  The Citizenship Judge stated in part: 
 
 
 
 "... You stated in your application that you were physically present in Canada for 1154 days during the relevant period and absent 95 days. You are 36 days short of the minimum requirement of 1,095 days as prescribed in Paragraph 5(1)(c) of the  
 Act 
 . 
 
 
 
 "At the hearing, you were requested to provide additional documents to support your claim of residence in Canada. The letter of January 15, 2007, which you were given at the interview further stated that 'I understand that, should such documentation not be provided, my Citizenship Application will be [sic] non approved by the Judge.' 
 
 
 
 "To date, you have failed to provide the additional documents requested and some documents are not within the four year review period (October 18, 2000 to October 18, 2004). ... 
 
 
 
 "I was therefore unable to determine whether or not you met all the requirements of the  
 Act 
  with respect to [sic] 'Residence'. 
 
 
 
 "The Issue: 
 
 
 
 "Have you, the applicant, accumulated at least three years (1,095 days) of residence in Canada within the four years (1,460 days) immediately preceding the date of your application for Canadian citizenship? 
 
 
 
 "Decision: 
 
 
 
 "For reasons provided above, I am unable to approve your application because you have not met the residence requirement under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the  
 Act 
  ..." 
 
 
 
 [10] 
  The Judge refused Mr. Yang's application for citizenship. 
 
 
 
 ISSUES 
 
 
 
 [11] 
  The issues in this appeal are: 
 
 
 
 1. What is the effect of the Citizenship Judge's failure to render a decision within the 60 days required by the 
  Act 
 ? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the Citizenship Judge err in refusing the citizenship application? 
 
 
 
 3. What remedy is available if the citizenship judge erred in respect of either of the above issues?

  In

  In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED further distinguished between the interpretation of statutes or jurisprudence and fact finding by citizenship judges: 
 
 
 
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED( 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 [15] 
  In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Supreme Court held it was not necessary to conduct a standard of review analysis where a standard was previously decided. Accordingly I conclude the standard of review in this matter is correctness in the interpretation of statute or jurisprudence and reasonableness in the application of facts to the law. 
 
 
 
 ANALYSIS 
 
 
 
 Sixty Day Requirement for Decision 
 
 
 
 [16] 
  Mr. Yang contends he was prejudiced by delay since he left Canada shortly after the hearing to work for family in China, and by implication he lost the opportunity to remedy the 36 day shortfall by staying in Canada. The Respondent responds by simply noting that Mr. Yang left even before the 60 days period expired. 
 
 
 
 [17] 
  The 
  Act 
  provides: 
 
 
 
 "14(1) An application for 
 
 
 
 (a) a grant of citizenship under subsection 5(1), 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 shall be considered by a citizenship judge who shall, within sixty days of the day the application was referred to the judge, determine whether or not the person who made the application meets the requirements of this Act and the regulations with respect to the application." 
 
 
 
                                                                                                      
 
 
 
 "14(1) Dans les soixante jours de sa saisine, le juge de la citoyenneté statue sur la conformité - avec les dispositions applicables en l'espèce de la présente loi et de ses règlements - des demandes déposées en vue de: 
 
 
 
 a) l'attribution de la citoyenneté, au titre des paragraphes 5(1) ou (5) ..." 
 
 
 
 [18] 
  The 
  Act 
  is silent on the consequence of a decision rendered outside of the 60 days. 
 
 
 
 [19] 
  In  
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED found the 60 day limit in the  
 Act 
  was a procedural right. He found since s. 14 of the 
  Act 
  at that time provided for an appeal de novo there was an effective recourse for a breach of the 60 day limit. However,  
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED 
  was decided before Rule 300 was amended to no longer permit appeals de novo. 
 
 
 
 [20] 
  In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, a Citizenship Judge refused to adjourn a hearing beyond the 60 days allowed for decision in the 
  Act 
 . The applicant was ineligible for citizenship until after completing probation for a criminal conviction and wanted the judge to wait. He would still have been on probation at the expiry of the 60 day period. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED considered the citizenship judge bound by the 60 day time limit. She stated FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED  
 Sahota 
  para. 20. 
 
 
 
 [21] 
  The 
  Act 
  states the judge "shall" render a decision within 60 days. Section 11 of the  
 Interpretation Act 
  states "shall" is imperative. However, as noted in  
 The Interpretation of Statutes 
 , there is room for two types of procedural requirements in statute: mandatory and directory: 
 
 
 
 "A strong line of distinction may be drawn between cases where the prescriptions of the Act affect the performance of a duty and where they relate to a privilege or power. Where powers, rights or immunities are granted with a direction that certain regulations, ... shall be complied with, it seems neither unjust nor inconvenient to exact a rigorous observance of them as essential to the acquisition of the right or authority conferred,  
 ... But when a public duty is imposed and the statue requires that it shall be performed 
  in a certain manner, or  
 within a certain time 
 , or under other specified conditions,  
 such prescriptions may well be regarded as intended to be directory only in cases when injustice or inconvenience to others who have no control over those exercising the duty would result if such requirements were essential and imperative 
 .: 10th Ed. (1953), at 376-77. As quoted in  
 Principles of Administrative Law 
 , 5th Ed. Jones and de Villar, 2009 (Carswell, Toronto)." (emphasis added) 
 
 
 
 [22] 
  FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED considered this issue in  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. He stated: 
 
 
 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 
 [23] 
  The Federal Court of Appeal upheld Justice Lemieux's finding that the provision in question was directory.  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
 [24] 
  The 
  Act 
  confers citizenship when an applicant meets the statutory requirements. Voiding citizenship decisions for being late would cause serious inconvenience and injustice for successful applicants. They would not be able to go about their affairs with the certain knowledge of citizenship. Equally important is the timely informing of unsuccessful applicants so that they may address shortcomings in their applications and apply anew. 
 
 
 
 [25] 
  In my view the 60 day requirement in s. 14(5) of the 
  Act 
  is directory. The Citizenship Judge did not lose jurisdiction because the delay exceeded the prescribed 60 days. 
 
 
 
 Did the Citizenship Judge err in refusing the citizenship application? 
 
 
 
 [26] 
  In  
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED described the jurisprudence that has emerged on the question of residency required to qualify for citizenship: 
 
 
 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 
 [27] 
  A Citizenship Judge may apply any one of the three tests in deciding if the residency requirement is met.  
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED 
 , supra,  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
 [28] 
  The Judge may not "blend" the tests but may discuss alternatives in explaining the choice of test applied. In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 [29] 
  The 
  Act 
  requires the Citizenship Judge to give reasons. This is especially important where the judge refuses an application for citizenship. Jurisprudence calls for clear reasons. In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 
 [30] 
  The Citizenship Judge's reasons in this case are confusing. From the onset, Mr. Yang acknowledged his shortfall in days of physical presence in Canada. He requested the Citizenship Judge consider the centralized mode of living test. The Judge appeared to do so by reserving his decision and requesting more documents. However, the Judge then appears to dismiss any consideration of a centralized mode of living test and revert to a strict count of days. 
 
 
 
 [31] 
  While citizenship judges may select which residency test to apply, applicants are entitled to clear and meaningful reasons. In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED found a mixed message and lack of guidance provided in the decision led him to conclude the citizenship judge erred. 
 
 
 
 [32] 
  I am unable to say if the Citizenship Judge rejected the centralized mode of living approach because the Applicant gave what appears to be a waiver or because the documents and other information which had been submitted by Mr. Yang were inadequate. If the Citizenship Judge decided on the basis of an apparent waiver, that would be an error, since the judge is duty bound to consider the application. The Judge's use of the formalistic phrase "For reasons above" does not inform the Applicant in any meaningful way how his application for citizenship is deficient. 
 
 
 
 [33] 
  In my view the Citizenship Judge's decision does not provide the Applicant with clear and meaningful reasons as required by the 
  Act 
  and jurisprudence. In this regard, the judge erred. 
 
 
 
 Available Remedies 
 
 
 
 [34] 
  The Citizenship Judge breached the 60 day time period for rendering a decision. However, the breach of a procedural right cannot give rise to a substantive right,  
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
 [35] 
  Nothing in the 
  Act 
  remotely suggests citizenship can be achieved by any other means than what is set out in the legislation. 
 
 
 
 [36] 
  The record before this Court is not complete. For instance, the interview of Mr. Yang is not available. In these circumstances, I consider it appropriate to remit the hearing back for re-determination before another citizenship judge. 
 
 
 
 [37] 
  Finally, there remains the matter of addressing the failure to issue a decision within the statutory 60 day period. No explanation is offered for the fifteen month delay of the ruling on Mr. Yang's citizenship application. 
 
 
 
 [38] 
  Costs have been awarded because failure to comply with a directory requirement should not be sanctioned. In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Federal Court of Appeal awarded costs for the unsuccessful applicant at both levels of court because non-compliance with a directory requirement should not be sanctioned. 
 
 
 
 [39] 
  Accordingly, I find the Applicant is entitled to costs. 
 
 
 
 CONCLUSION 
 
 
 
 [40] 
  I allow this appeal and direct that this matter be re-determined by a different Judge of the Citizenship Court. 
 
 
 
 [41] 
  Costs are awarded to the Applicant. 
 
 
 
 JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 [42] 
   
 THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that 
 : 
 
 
 
 1. the appeal is allowed; 
 
 
 
 2. this matter is remitted back to be re-determined by a different Judge of the Citizenship Court; and 
 
 
 
 3. costs are awarded to the Applicant. 
 
 
 
 Appeal allowed.

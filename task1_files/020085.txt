I.
Overview
[1]
Brown, J.
: This is an application for judicial review brought by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration [the applicant] under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the IRPA] of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Refugee Protection Division [the RPD], dated July 31, 2013 (and rendered orally on July 3, 2013), in which the RPD determined that Gergo Balogh, Adrienn Juhasz, Jazmin Leila Balogh, Mercedesz Adrie Liptai, and Gabor Juhasz, [the respondents] were Convention refugees.
[2]
In my opinion, this application for judicial review should be allowed for the reasons set out below.
II.
Facts
[3]
The respondents arrived in Canada on November 21, 2010, and applied for refugee protection the same day on the basis of well founded fear of persecution in Hungary on account of their Roma ethnicity.
[4]
Gergo Balogh was the principal claimant [PC]. The claims of Adrienn Juhasz (the PC's spouse), Gabor Juhasz (the PC's brother-in-law), Jazmin Leila Balogh and Mercedesz Adrie Liptai (the PC's minor children) were joined to the PC's claim pursuant to Rule 55 of the
Refugee Protection Division Rules
, SOR/2012-256.
[5]
The RPD heard the respondents' refugee protection claim on July 3, 2013 in Toronto and rendered its oral decision and reasons on the same day. Written reasons are dated July 31, 2013.
III.
Decision under Review
[6]
The respondents' identities were established through a certified copy of their passports.
[7]
The RPD found the respondents all testified in a consistent manner, although it also found them to be "somewhat credible". Some inconsistencies were noted, but none of which were considered enough to impugn their testimonies.
[8]
The RPD noted the existence of a presumption of state protection, except in situations where the State is in a complete breakdown. The RPD also noted that the respondents had the burden, on a balance of probabilities, of rebutting the presumption of state protection by adducing clear and convincing evidence.
[9]
The RPD noted that while the effectiveness of the protection is a relevant consideration, the test for a finding of state protection is whether the protection is adequate rather than effective
per se
. In other words, the state protection does not need to be perfect.
[10]
In determining the adequacy of state protection, the RPD noted the importance of considering whether a legislative and procedural framework exists to that effect, as well as whether the State, through the police or other authorities, is able and willing to effectively implement that framework. The RPD also noted that failures by the local authorities to provide protection do not amount to failure by the State as a whole.
[11]
The RPD noted that the burden of rebutting the presumption of state protection is directly proportional to the degree of democracy in that State. The RPD then noted that, based on the evidence before it: Hungary is a democracy; has free and fair elections; a relatively independent and impartial judiciary; is in control of its territory; has a functioning security force to uphold the laws and constitution in place; and was not in a state of complete breakdown. The RPD noted the existence of a new Fundamental Law, as well as more than twenty new Cardinal Laws that "gave rise to concerns" that the country's democratic institutions could be undermined, but concluded that there was no persuasive evidence to show that Hungary was not a democracy, and that any parts of the new legislation that do not comply with the basic tenets of the European Union could be challenged.
[12]
However, the RPD found that, in this case, the respondents were persecuted in Hungary on the basis of the cumulative acts of discrimination directed at them, and that the respondents had rebutted the presumption of state protection.
[13]
The RPD concluded that, "[h]aving considered all the evidence and Counsel's submissions" as well as case law, the respondents were Convention refugees.
IV.
Issue
[14]
This matter raises the following issue: did the RPD err by failing to provide adequate written reasons on the issue of state protection, and as to how it concluded that the respondents experienced persecution?
V.
Standard of Review
[15]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the Supreme Court of Canada held that a standard of review analysis is unnecessary where "the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question".
[16]
In
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Newfoundland Nurses
], the Supreme Court of Canada held that the adequacy of reasons is not a stand-alone basis for quashing a decision and that any challenge to the reasoning/result of a decision should therefore be made within the reasonableness standard of review.
[17]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47, the Supreme Court of Canada explained what is required of a court reviewing on the reasonableness standard of review:
[47] ... A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
[18]
In
Newfoundland Nurses
at para 16, the Supreme Court explained what is required of a tribunal's reasons in order to meet the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria:
[16] Reasons may not include all the arguments, statutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details the reviewing judge would have preferred, but that does not impugn the validity of either the reasons or the result under a reasonableness analysis. A decision-maker is not required to make an explicit finding on each constituent element, however subordinate, leading to its final conclusion (
Service Employees' International Union, Local No 333 v Nipawin District Staff Nurses Assn.
, [1975] 1 SCR 382, at p 391). In other words, if the reasons allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> criteria are met.
VI.
Submissions of the Parties and Analysis
[19]
Section 169 of the IRPA requires that the RPD gives reasons for the disposition of all claims:
Decisions and reasons
169. In the case of a decision of a Division, other than an interlocutory decision:
(a) the decision takes effect in accordance with the rules;
(b) reasons for the decision must be given;
(c) the decision may be rendered orally or in writing, except a decision of the Refugee Appeal Division, which must be rendered in writing;
(d) if the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim, written reasons must be provided to the claimant and the Minister;
(e) if the person who is the subject of proceedings before the Board or the Minister requests reasons for a decision within 10 days of notification of the decision, or in circumstances set out in the rules of the Board, the Division must provide written reasons; and
(f) the period in which to apply for judicial review with respect to a decision of the Board is calculated from the giving of notice of the decision or from the sending of written reasons, whichever is later.
Décisions
169. Les dispositions qui suivent s'appliquent aux décisions, autres qu'interlocutoires, des sections:
a) elles prennent effet conformément aux règles;
b) elles sont motivées;
c) elles sont rendues oralement ou par écrit, celles de la Section d'appel des réfugiés devant toutefois être rendues par écrit;
d) le rejet de la demande d'asile par la Section de la protection des réfugiés est motivé par écrit et les motifs sont transmis au demandeur et au ministre;
e) les motifs écrits sont transmis à la personne en cause et au ministre sur demande faite dans les dix jours suivant la notification ou dans les cas prévus par les règles de la Commission;
f) les délais de contrôle judiciaire courent à compter du dernier en date des faits suivants: notification de la décision et transmission des motifs écrits.
[20]
Accordingly, this Court has held that a refugee claimant, the Minister, and the public at large equally have the right to know the reasons for which a claim was or was not allowed (see
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[21]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 17-20, the Federal Court of Appeal listed some of the beneficial purposes served by reasons:
[17] ... Reasons serve a number of beneficial purposes including that of focussing the decision maker on the relevant factors and evidence. In the words of the Supreme Court of Canada:
Reasons, it has been argued, foster better decision making by ensuring that issues and reasoning are well articulated and, therefore, more carefully thought out. The process of writing reasons for decision by itself may be a guarantee of a better decision.
[18] Reasons also provide the parties with the assurance that their representations have been considered.
[19] In addition, reasons allow the parties to effectuate any right of appeal or judicial review that they might have. They provide a basis for an assessment of possible grounds for appeal or review. They allow the appellate or reviewing body to determine whether the decision maker erred and thereby render him or her accountable to that body. This is particularly important when the decision is subject to a deferential standard of review.
[20] Finally, in the case of a regulated industry, the regulator's reasons for making a particular decision provide guidance to others who are subject to the regulator's jurisdiction. They provide a standard by which future activities of those affected by the decision can be measured.
[22]
The applicant submits that the RPD's reasons fail to address the issue of state protection and articulate how the discrimination that the respondents experienced amounts to persecution, thus rendering the decision unreasonable for lack of justification, transparency and intelligibility.
[23]
The respondents submit that the RPD provided adequate reasons, addressed the issue of Hungary as a democracy, articulated the evidence of the claimant on which it relied, considered evidence of Hungary's ability to protect (contrary and otherwise), and sufficiently analyzed the issue of persecution.
A.
Adequacy of reasons regarding state protection
[24]
The respondents submit, and I agree, that "the starting point for the inquiry in respect of an argument regarding the impact of failure to mention key evidence is that the reviewing court must presume that the tribunal considered the entire record" (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[25]
The respondents also correctly submit that the RPD is not required to comment on every piece of evidence in the record (see
Newfoundland Nurses
at para 16) and that its duty to expressly refer to evidence that contradicts its key findings does not apply where the contrary evidence in question is only general country documentary evidence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[26]
However, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> this Court held:
[28] The Board must actually analyse the evidence it references and consider how that evidence relates to the issue of state protection. It is insufficient to merely summarize large volumes of evidence and then state a conclusion that state protection is adequate. The evidence and the conclusion must be connected with a line of reasoning that is transparent and intelligible.
[27]
I agree with the applicant. It is not evident from the RPD's reasons that it turned its mind to key issues such as how the respondents rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. This is because the RPD did not reference any basis for its conclusion; the RPD simply stated it had concluded that the respondents "have rebutted the presumption of protection in their personal circumstances".
[28]
There is no doubt that the RPD recited a great deal of relevant law in connection with the doctrine of state protection. However, the critical failure was to leap from that legal summary to the conclusion that the presumption of state protection was rebutted. It is simply not possible for this Court to determine how that result was obtained. This is not a case where the Court can fill in the dots. Rather it is a case where there are no dots to fill in.
[29]
It is not the duty of this Court is to review the (conflicting) evidence on State protection and make its own determination. This is judicial review, not a hearing
de novo
. Given the very serious deficiency in these reasons, I am compelled to conclude that this decision does not meet the tests of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
Newfoundland Nurses
. There is an analytical vacuum in that the reasons lack the necessary elements of justification, transparency and intelligibility.
B.
Adequacy of reasons regarding discrimination amounting to persecution
[30]
I also agree with the applicant that the RPD erred by failing to substantiate its conclusion that the cumulative acts of discrimination directed at the respondents amounts to persecution. The RPD failed in its duty to conduct a careful analysis of the evidence adduced and a proper balancing of the various elements contained therein. As held by the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 3:
It is true that the dividing line between persecution and discrimination or harassment is difficult to establish, the more so since, in the refugee law context, it has been found that discrimination may very well be seen as amounting to persecution. It is true also that the identification of persecution behind incidents of discrimination or harassment is not purely a question of fact but a mixed question of law and fact, legal concepts being involved. It remains, however, that, in all cases,
it is for the Board to draw the conclusion in a particular factual context by proceeding with a careful analysis of the evidence adduced and a proper balancing of the various elements contained therein
, and the intervention of this Court is not warranted unless the conclusion reached appears to be capricious or unreasonable. [Emphasis added]
[31]
The RPD's conclusion is not supported by any analysis or balancing of factors.
[32]
This Court has repeatedly stated that a failure to provide any real explanation as to why the cumulative actions do not amount to persecution is a reviewable error (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[33]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> this Court held that the standard set forth in
Newfoundland Nurses
was not met where there was a gap in the reasoning, at a critical juncture, such that it is unclear as to how and why the conclusion was reached.
[34]
The applicant rightly refers to
Canada (Public Safety and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to the effect that:
[36] ... the reasons for decision must contain enough information about the decision and its bases so that, first, a party can understand the basis for the decision and decide whether or not to apply for judicial review, and second, the supervising court can assess, meaningfully, whether the panel met minimum standards of legality. A decision is therefore justified and intelligible when its basis has been given and the basis is understandable, with some discernable rationality and logic.
[35]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> this Court held:
[11]
Newfoundland Nurses
is not an open invitation to the Court to provide reasons that were not given, nor is it licence to guess what findings might have been made or to speculate as to what the tribunal might have been thinking. This is particularly so where the reasons are silent on a critical issue ...
Newfoundland Nurses
allows reviewing courts to connect the dots on the page where the lines, and the direction they are headed, may be readily drawn. Here, there were no dots on the page.
[36]
In my opinion, these principles are directly applicable to the present case and support my conclusion that the RPD's decision was unreasonable for lack of justification, transparency and intelligibility in this respect as well. The RPD's reasons do not allow either the Court, the parties, or the public to understand why the tribunal made its decision, nor do they allow one to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes without guessing what finding might have been made or speculating as to what the RPD might have been thinking.
[37]
The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
Newfoundland Nurses
criteria have not been met.
VII.
Conclusion
[38]
The application for judicial review must therefore be allowed. The RPD's decision is set aside and the matter is remitted for re-determination by a differently constituted panel of the RPD. There are no costs. Neither party requested the certification of a question, nor is there a question of general importance to certify.
JUDGMENT
[39]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review is allowed;
2. The RPD's decision is set aside and the matter is remitted for re-determination by a differently constituted panel of the RPD;
3. There are no costs; and
4. No question of general importance is certified.

I.
Aperçu
[1]
Le juge Brown
[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie de la demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée par le ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration [le demandeur], en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR] visant la décision rendue par la Section de la protection des réfugiés [la SPR] de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada [la Commission], datée du 31 juillet 2013 (rendue oralement le 3 juillet 2013), par laquelle la SPR a décidé que Gergo Balogh, Adrienn Juhasz, Jazmin Leila Balogh, Mercedesz Adrie Liptai, et Gabor Juhasz [les défendeurs] avaient qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention.
[2]
Selon moi, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire devrait être accueillie pour les motifs énoncés ci-dessous.
II.
Les faits
[3]
Les défendeurs sont arrivés au Canada le 21 novembre 2010 et ont présenté une demande d'asile le jour même invoquant une crainte fondée de persécution en Hongrie, en raison de leur origine ethnique rom.
[4]
M. Gergo Balogh était le demandeur principal [DP]. Les demandes de Adrienn Juhasz (l'épouse du DP), Gabor Juhasz (le beau-frère du DP), Jazmin Leila Balogh et Mercedesz Adrie Liptai (les enfants mineurs du DP) ont été jointes à la demande du DP, conformément à l'article 55 des
Règles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2012-256.
[5]
La SPR a entendu la demande d'asile des défendeurs le 3 juillet 2013, à Toronto, et a rendu sa décision et ses motifs oralement le même jour. Les motifs écrits sont datés du 31 juillet 2013.
III.
La décision soumise au contrôle
[6]
L'identité des défendeurs a été établie au moyen d'une copie certifiée de leurs passeports.
[7]
La SPR a conclu que les défendeurs avaient témoigné de manière cohérente, même si elle a aussi conclu qu'ils étaient « relativement crédibles ». Des incohérences ont été relevées, mais aucune de celles-ci ne suffisait à entacher leurs témoignages.
[8]
La SPR a fait observer qu'il existe une présomption de la protection de l'État, sauf dans les cas où il y a un effondrement complet de l'appareil étatique. La SPR a aussi fait remarquer que les défendeurs avaient le fardeau de réfuter la présomption de la protection de l'État par la production d'éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants, selon la prépondérance des probabilités.
[9]
La SPR a fait remarquer que, bien que l'efficacité de la protection offerte par l'État soit un élément pertinent à prendre en considération, il ressort de la jurisprudence que le critère à appliquer au regard de la protection de l'État consiste à établir si la protection est suffisante, plutôt que si elle est efficace au sens strict. En d'autres termes, la protection de l'État n'a pas à être parfaite.
[10]
Lorsqu'elle a établi le caractère suffisant de la protection de l'État, la SPR a souligné l'importance d'examiner s'il existe des mécanismes légaux et procéduraux de protection, mais également si l'État, au moyen de la police ou d'autres autorités, est apte et disposé à mettre ces mécanismes en œuvre. La SPR a aussi souligné que les omissions des autorités locales d'assumer la protection n'équivalent pas à une absence de protection de l'État dans son ensemble.
[11]
La SPR a relevé que le fardeau de renverser la présomption de la protection de l'État est directement proportionnel au degré de démocratie atteint chez l'État en cause. La SPR a ensuite souligné que, sur la foi de la preuve dont elle disposait: la Hongrie est une démocratie; elle tient des élections libres et équitables; elle a un système judiciaire relativement indépendant et impartial; elle a le contrôle de son territoire; elle a une force de sécurité efficace pour faire observer sa constitution et ses lois; rien ne semble indiquer qu'il y a un effondrement complet de l'appareil étatique. La SPR a relevé l'existence d'une nouvelle loi fondamentale ainsi que celle de plus de 20 nouvelles lois cardinales qui « ont soulevé des préoccupations », du fait qu'elles pouvaient miner les institutions démocratiques du pays, mais la SPR a conclu qu'il n'y avait pas d'éléments de preuve convaincants démontrant que la Hongrie n'était pas une démocratie, et que toute disposition des nouvelles lois qui allait à l'encontre des principes généraux de l'Union européenne pouvait être contestée.
[12]
Toutefois, la SPR a conclu que, en l'espèce, les défendeurs avaient été persécutés en Hongrie pour des motifs cumulatifs d'actes discriminatoires envers eux, et qu'ils avaient réfuté la présomption de la protection de l'État.
[13]
La SPR a conclu qu' « [a] près avoir examiné l'ensemble de la preuve et les observations du conseil », ainsi que la jurisprudence, les défendeurs avaient qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention.
IV.
La question en litige
[14]
La présente affaire soulève la question suivante: la SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a omis de fournir des motifs écrits adéquats quant à la question de la protection de l'État et quant à la façon dont elle a conclu que les défendeurs avaient subi de la persécution?
V.
La norme de contrôle
[15]
Aux paragraphes 57 et 62 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], la Cour suprême du Canada a décidé qu'il n'est pas toujours nécessaire de se livrer à une analyse exhaustive de la norme de contrôle si « la jurisprudence établit déjà de manière satisfaisante le degré de déférence correspondant à une catégorie de questions en particulier ».
[16]
Aux paragraphes 14 et 22 de l'arrêt
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Newfoundland Nurses
], la Cour suprême du Canada a décidé que l' « insuffisance » des motifs ne permet pas à elle seule de casser une décision et que le raisonnement qui sous-tend la décision/le résultat ne peut donc être remis en question que dans le cadre de l'analyse du caractère raisonnable de celle-ci.
[17]
Au paragraphe 47 de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada a expliqué ce que doit faire une cour de révision lorsqu'elle examine une décision selon la norme de la décision raisonnable:
[47] [...] Il est loisible au tribunal administratif d'opter pour l'une ou l'autre des différentes solutions rationnelles acceptables. La cour de révision se demande dès lors si la décision et sa justification possèdent les attributs de la raisonnabilité. Le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
[18]
Au paragraphe 16 de l'arrêt
Newfoundland Nurses
, la Cour suprême a expliqué ce que doivent contenir les motifs d'un tribunal afin de répondre aux critères établis dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[16] Il se peut que les motifs ne fassent pas référence à tous les arguments, dispositions législatives, précédents ou autres détails que le juge siégeant en révision aurait voulu y lire, mais cela ne met pas en doute leur validité ni celle du résultat au terme de l'analyse du caractère raisonnable de la décision. Le décideur n'est pas tenu de tirer une conclusion explicite sur chaque élément constitutif du raisonnement, si subordonné soit-il, qui a mené à sa conclusion finale (
Union internationale des employés des services,
local no 333 c Nipawin District Staff Nurses Assn
, [1975] 1 R.C.S. 382, p. 391). En d'autres termes, les motifs répondent aux critères établis dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> s'ils permettent à la cour de révision de comprendre le fondement de la décision du tribunal et de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables.
VI.
Observations des parties et analyse
[19]
L'article 169 de la LIPR exige que la SPR donne les motifs pour lesquels elle a tranché toutes les demandes qui lui sont soumises:
Décisions
169. Les dispositions qui suivent s'appliquent aux décisions, autres qu'interlocutoires, des sections:
a) elles prennent effet conformément aux règles;
b) elles sont motivées;
c) elles sont rendues oralement ou par écrit, celles de la Section d'appel des réfugiés devant toutefois être rendues par écrit;
d) le rejet de la demande d'asile par la Section de la protection des réfugiés est motivé par écrit et les motifs sont transmis au demandeur et au ministre;
e) les motifs écrits sont transmis à la personne en cause et au ministre sur demande faite dans les dix jours suivant la notification ou dans les cas prévus par les règles de la Commission;
f) les délais de contrôle judiciaire courent à compter du dernier en date des faits suivants: notification de la décision et transmission des motifs écrits.
Decisions and reasons
169. In the case of a decision of a Division, other than an interlocutory decision:
(
a
) the decision takes effect in accordance with the rules;
(
b
) reasons for the decision must be given;
(
c
) the decision may be rendered orally or in writing, except a decision of the Refugee Appeal Division, which must be rendered in writing;
(
d
) if the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim, written reasons must be provided to the claimant and the Minister;
(
e
) if the person who is the subject of proceedings before the Board or the Minister requests reasons for a decision within 10 days of notification of the decision, or in circumstances set out in the rules of the Board, the Division must provide written reasons; and
(
f
) the period in which to apply for judicial review with respect to a decision of the Board is calculated from the giving of notice of the decision or from the sending of written reasons, whichever is later.
[20]
Par conséquent, la Cour a décidé que le demandeur d'asile, le ministre et le public en général ont tous un droit égal de connaître les motifs pour lesquels une demande a été rejetée ou accueillie (voir
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[21]
Aux paragraphes 17 à 20 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour d'appel fédérale a énuméré certaines des fins utiles que visent les motifs:
[17] [...] Les motifs visent plusieurs fins utiles, dont celle de concentrer l'attention du décideur sur les facteurs et les éléments de preuve pertinents. Pour reprendre les termes de la Cour suprême du Canada:
On a soutenu que la rédaction de motifs favorise une meilleure prise de décision en ce qu'elle exige une bonne formulation des questions et du raisonnement et, en conséquence, une analyse plus rigoureuse. Le processus de rédaction des motifs d'une décision peut en lui-même garantir une meilleure décision.
[18] Les motifs garantissent aussi aux parties que leurs observations ont été prises en considération.
[19] De plus, les motifs permettent aux parties de faire valoir tout droit d'appel ou de contrôle judiciaire à leur disposition. Ils servent de point de départ à une évaluation des moyens d'appel ou de contrôle possibles. Ils permettent à l'organisme d'appel ou de révision d'établir si le décideur a commis une erreur et si cette erreur le rend justiciable devant cet organisme. Cet aspect est particulièrement important lorsque la décision est assujettie à une norme d'examen fondée sur la retenue.
[20] Finalement, dans le cas d'une industrie réglementée, les motifs de la décision de l'organisme de réglementation donnent des précisions à tous les autres qui sont soumis à la compétence de cet organisme. Ils fournissent une norme par rapport à laquelle il est possible d'apprécier les futures activités de ceux qui sont touchés par cette décision.
[22] Le demandeur soutient que les motifs de la SPR ne traitent ni de la question de la protection de l'État ni de la façon dont les actes discriminatoires subis par les défendeurs équivalent à la persécution, ce qui rend ainsi la décision déraisonnable, parce qu'elle manque de justification, de transparence et d'intelligibilité.
[23]
Les défendeurs font observer que la SPR a fourni des motifs suffisants, a traité de la question de la Hongrie en tant que démocratie, a énoncé les éléments de preuve du demandeur sur lesquels la Commission s'est fondée, a pris en compte la preuve de la capacité à protéger (en opposition et autrement) de la Hongrie, et a suffisamment analysé la question de la persécution.
A.
Le caractère suffisant des motifs portant sur la protection de l'État
[24]
Les défendeurs soutiennent et j'en conviens avec eux que, « lorsque la cour de révision est saisie d'un argument qui porte sur les conséquences pour le tribunal de ne pas avoir mentionné des éléments de preuve importants, son examen consiste initialement à présumer que le tribunal a pris en compte l'ensemble du dossier » (voir le paragraphe 11 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[25]
Les défendeurs soutiennent aussi à juste titre que la SPR n'est pas tenue de tirer une conclusion explicite sur chaque élément constitutif du dossier (voir
Newfoundland Nurses
, au paragraphe 16), et que l'obligation qui pèse sur la SPR de mentionner expressément une preuve contredisant ses conclusions principales ne s'applique pas lorsque la preuve en question se révèle être une preuve documentaire de nature générale sur la situation dans le pays (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 30).
[26]
Toutefois, au paragraphe 28 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour a décidé que:
[28] La Commission doit effectivement analyser la preuve qu'elle mentionne et se demander en quoi cette preuve concerne la question de la protection de l'État. Il ne suffit pas de résumer une preuve abondante et de conclure ensuite que la protection de l'État est adéquate. La preuve et la conclusion doivent être rattachées à un raisonnement transparent et intelligible.
[27]
Je souscris à l'argument du demandeur. Il n'est pas clair à la lecture des motifs de la SPR que cette dernière s'est concentrée sur les questions principales telles que la façon dont les défendeurs ont réfuté la présomption de la protection de l'État au moyen d'éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants. Il en était ainsi parce que la SPR n'a référé à aucun fondement pour sa conclusion; la SPR a simplement déclaré qu'elle a conclu que les défendeurs « ont également réfuté la présomption de la protection de l'État en ce qui a trait à leur situation personnelle ».
[28]
Il est indubitable que la SPR a renvoyé à de nombreux précédents applicables relatifs à la doctrine de la protection de l'État. Toutefois, l'omission fondamentale fut de sauter de ce résumé de la jurisprudence à la conclusion que la présomption de la protection de l'État avait été réfutée. Il n'est simplement pas possible que la Cour détermine comment ce résultat fut obtenu. Nous ne sommes pas en présence d'un cas où la Cour peut relier des pointillés. Au contraire, il s'agit d'un cas où il n'y a pas de pointillés à relier.
[29]
Il n'incombe pas à la Cour d'apprécier la preuve (contradictoire) relative à la protection de l'État et de tirer ses propres conclusions. Nous sommes en présence d'un contrôle judiciaire et non pas d'une audience
de novo
. Étant donné le manquement grave dans ses motifs, la Cour est dans l'obligation de conclure que cette décision ne satisfait pas aux critères établis dans les arrêts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et
Newfoundland Nurses
. Il y a un vide analytique, car les motifs manquent d'éléments nécessaires à leur justification, leur transparence et leur intelligibilité.
B.
Le caractère suffisant des motifs concernant la discrimination qui équivaut à la persécution
[30]
Je conviens aussi avec le demandeur que la SPR a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle n'a pas étayé sa conclusion selon laquelle les actes cumulatifs de discrimination envers les défendeurs équivalent à la persécution. La SPR a manqué à son obligation de mener une analyse minutieuse de la preuve présentée et de soupeser comme il convient les divers éléments de preuve dont elle disposait. Comme la Cour d'appel fédérale l'a décidé au paragraphe 3 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[traduction]
Il est vrai que la ligne de démarcation entre la persécution et la discrimination ou le harcèlement est difficile à tracer, d'autant plus que, dans le contexte du droit des réfugiés, il a été conclu que la discrimination peut fort bien être considérée comme équivalant à la persécution. Il est également vrai que la question de l'existence de la persécution dans les cas de discrimination ou de harcèlement n'est pas simplement une question de fait, mais aussi une question mixte de droit et de fait, et que des notions juridiques sont en cause. Toutefois, il reste que, dans tous les cas
, il incombe à la Section du statut de réfugié de tirer sa conclusion dans le contexte factuel particulier, en effectuant une analyse minutieuse de la preuve présentée et en soupesant comme il convient les divers éléments de la preuve,
et que l'intervention de cette Cour n'est pas justifiée à moins que la conclusion tirée ne semble arbitraire ou déraisonnable. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[31]
La conclusion de la SPR n'est étayée ni par une analyse ni par la pondération des facteurs.
[32]
La Cour a maintes fois affirmé que le fait pour la SPR de ne pas expliquer suffisamment pourquoi les actions cumulatives n'équivalent pas à la persécution constitue une erreur susceptible de contrôle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[33]
Au paragraphe 20 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour a décidé que le critère énoncé dans l'arrêt
Newfoundland Nurses
n'a pas été pris en compte lorsque le raisonnement comporte une lacune d'une telle ampleur sur un aspect critique qu'il est difficile de savoir comment et pourquoi la Commission en est arrivée à la conclusion en question.
[34]
Le demandeur renvoie à bon droit au paragraphe 36 de la décision
Canada (Sécurité publique et Protection civile) c Ramirez
, 2013 CF 387, et aux paragraphes 17 à 19 de l'arrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  selon lequel:
[36] [...] les motifs de la décision doivent comporter suffisamment de renseignements pour permettre, d'une part, à une partie de comprendre son fondement et de décider s'il convient ou non d'en demander la révision judiciaire, et d'autre part, à la cour de révision d'évaluer si le tribunal a satisfait aux normes minimales de légalité. Une décision est donc justifiée et intelligible lorsque son fondement est précisé et qu'il est compréhensible, rationnel et logique.
[35]
Au paragraphe 11 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour a décidé que:
[11] L'arrêt
Newfoundland Nurses
ne donne pas à la Cour toute la latitude voulue pour fournir des motifs qui n'ont pas été donnés, ni ne l'autorise à deviner quelles conclusions auraient pu être tirées ou à émettre des hypothèses sur ce que le tribunal a pu penser. C'est particulièrement le cas quand les motifs passent sous silence une question essentielle. [...] L'arrêt
Newfoundland Nurses
permet aux cours de contrôle de relier les points sur la page quand les lignes, et la direction qu'elles prennent peuvent être facilement discernées. Ici, il n'y a même pas de points sur la page.
[36]
À mon avis, ces principes sont directement applicables en l'espèce et ils appuient ma conclusion selon laquelle la décision de la SPR était déraisonnable parce qu'elle manquait de justification, de transparence et d'intelligibilité à cet égard aussi. Les motifs de la SPR ne permettent ni à la Cour ni aux parties ni au public en général de comprendre la raison pour laquelle le tribunal a rendu sa décision, ils ne permettent pas non plus à quiconque de déterminer si la conclusion appartient aux issues acceptables sans avoir à deviner quelle conclusion aurait pu être tirée ou sans émettre des conjectures quant à la nature possible du raisonnement de la SPR.
[37]
Les critères énoncés dans les arrêts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et
Newfoundland Nurses
n'ont pas été pris en compte.
VII.
Dispositif
[38]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire doit donc être accueillie. La décision de la SPR est annulée et l'affaire est renvoyée à un tribunal différemment constitué de la SPR pour qu'il statue à nouveau sur celle-ci. Aucuns dépens ne sont adjugés. Ni l'une ni l'autre des parties n'a demandé la certification d'une question et il n'y a aucune question de portée générale à certifier.
JUGEMENT
[39]

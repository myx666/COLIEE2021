Kane, J.
: Ms Granata, a Canadian citizen, married Mr Mobolaji Debayo-Doherty (Mr Doherty), a citizen of Nigeria, on February 25, 2008. She subsequently applied to sponsor Mr Doherty for immigration to Canada. The application was refused by a visa officer and that decision was appealed. Ms Granata now seeks judicial review, pursuant to section 72 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the
Act
], of the September 6, 2012 decision of the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board, which dismissed her appeal and found that her marriage to Mr Doherty was not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status under the
Act
.
[2]
For the reasons that follow, the application is dismissed.
Background
[3]
Mr Doherty is a citizen of Nigeria, where he currently resides. In November 2003, he entered Canada from the US, claiming refugee protection. In November 2004, his refugee claim was refused, and leave to appeal was denied. In May 2006, his motion for a stay of deportation was dismissed by this Court. A warrant was issued for his removal in August 2006, which was executed on March 10, 2009. On March 12, 2009, Mr Doherty was deported from Canada to the US and detained by US authorities until May 2009, then deported to Nigeria.
[4]
Mr Doherty was previously married to another Canadian citizen in April 2006. They separated five months later and divorced in October 2007. He has a son from this marriage who resides in Canada. His ex-wife applied to sponsor him for permanent residence on April 17, 2006, but withdrew her sponsorship on June 11, 2007.
[5]
The current application for sponsorship by Ms Granata was submitted in October 2009, after Mr Doherty's deportation. Mr Doherty was interviewed at the visa post in Accra on August 5, 2010. As a preliminary finding, the visa officer was satisfied that the marriage was genuine. However, before the visa application was finalized, the visa post received a letter from Ms Granata, sent on July 30, 2010, which withdrew her sponsorship. Two weeks later she sent a letter to rescind the withdrawal of sponsorship.
[6]
Mr Doherty was interviewed at the visa post in Accra again on November 15, 2010. The visa officer found that there was a breakdown of marital relationship which led to Ms Granata's withdrawal of her sponsorship, notwithstanding that the withdrawal had been rescinded. The visa officer was not satisfied that the marriage was genuine or that it was not entered into primarily for the purpose of immigration. The spousal sponsorship application was refused by letter dated November 15, 2010. This decision was appealed to the IAD.
The IAD Decision
[7]
The IAD noted that to succeed on the appeal, Ms Granata must prove that the marriage was not entered into primarily for the purpose of her husband, Mr Doherty, gaining any status or privilege under the
Act
and
that it is genuine.
[8]
However, to dismiss the appeal, the IAD must find either that the marriage was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status or privilege under the
Act
or
that it is not genuine.
[9]
The IAD noted the objectives of immigration, including to reunite families in Canada, but found that Ms Granata had failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, both that the marriage was genuine
and
that it was not entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege under the
Act
. In coming to this conclusion, the IAD noted that it considered the evidence and submissions, including the documentary and photographic evidence, the telephone invoices, the length of time since the marriage, and the testimony given at the hearing. The IAD drew an adverse inference from the fact that Mr Doherty did not testify at the hearing. The IAD also found Ms Granata to be not credible, because her evidence was vague, evasive, self-contradictory, contradictory to information previously provided, and in some aspects defied logic and common sense. The IAD found that Ms Granata's lack of credibility rebutted the presumption that the evidence submitted was truthful.
[10]
The IAD acknowledged that generally, the testimony of an applicant alone would be sufficient to address the
bona fides
of a couple's intentions and that negative inferences would not be drawn from the failure of the other party to testify. However, the IAD canvassed the jurisprudence and the relevant evidentiary principles and drew a negative inference from Mr Doherty's failure to testify.
[11]
The IAD referred to John Sopinka, Sidney Lederman & Alan Bryant,
The Law of Evidence in Canada
, 2d ed (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999) and jurisprudence referring to Professor Wigmore's treatise on evidence, notably
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 116, which noted the relevant factors in determining whether it would be reasonable to expect a person to testify and which would support an adverse inference where that person does not testify.
[12]
The IAD noted that much of the case rested on the credibility of Ms Granata and Mr Doherty and that there had been no opportunity to question Mr Doherty about the inconsistencies in their accounts. The IAD also found, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr Doherty was aware of the hearing and chose not to testify by long distance telephone conference.
[13]
The Board noted at para 25:
As stated earlier, the appellant's evidence was found to be not credible, trustworthy or reliable and therefore not presumed to be true. In such circumstances, the appellant's failure to call the applicant as a witness contradicts both logic and common sense and, as such, is further reason for not presuming the appellant's evidence given under oath as to the genuineness of her marriage to be true. An adverse inference is thus drawn from the applicant's failure to testify at this hearing.
[14]
The Board found that Ms Granata's explanation for Mr Doherty's failure to testify - that telephone service was spotty and that he was at work, but that he could have called from home on a land line if they had known he should testify - was unconvincing.
[15]
With respect to the genuineness of the marriage, the IAD acknowledged that there are many factors to consider in determining whether a marriage is genuine (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] FCJ No 886). The Board considered several factors individually and then weighed the factors cumulatively and found that, on a balance of probabilities, the marriage is not genuine.
[16]
The IAD considered the length and timing of Mr Doherty's first marriage, and concluded that, on a balance of probabilities, his first marriage was not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purposes of obtaining status.
[17]
The IAD also noted the inconsistency in their respective accounts of when they first met. Ms Granata stated that she met Mr Doherty in February 2006. Mr Doherty stated in his application that he was first introduced to Ms Granata on February 21, 2006. However, during his interview at the visa post he indicated that they met sometime towards the end of 2006. The IAD found his explanation for the discrepancy, including that he was mistaken about the dates, to be unsatisfactory. Moreover, Mr Doherty indicated that they started dating shortly after they met. However, the Board noted that Mr Doherty married his first wife in April 2006 and it would be illogical that he met and started dating Ms Granata in February 2006, shortly before his marriage to his first wife.
[18]
The IAD noted that no photographs of the couple were submitted to substantiate their dating and cohabitation although there were photographs of the marriage ceremony with some people in the background.
[19]
The IAD accepted that the couple has a son together, born a few months after their marriage, but noted that no photographs of Mr Doherty with their son, Nathan, were submitted, even though Mr Doherty was not deported until nine months after Nathan's birth. The IAD concluded that there was insufficient evidence of an existing relationship between Mr Doherty and his son.
[20]
With respect to Ms Granata's withdrawal of sponsorship, the IAD found that, on a balance of probabilities, there was another reason for her actions. The IAD found that her explanation - that she withdrew her sponsorship because she learned that her husband was having an affair - to be unsatisfactory and not credible. In addition, during his interview at the visa post on November 15, 2010, Mr Doherty was not at all aware of the fact that Ms Granata had withdrawn her sponsorship on July 30, 2010. When confronted with the information that the sponsorship had been withdrawn and asked if there was any reason she would do so, Mr Doherty suggested that Ms Granata needed money and had asked his sister in the UK for funds, but he did not otherwise know why she would withdraw her sponsorship. However, at the IAD hearing, Ms Granata clearly stated that she had told her husband what she had done shortly after sending the letter in late July and August, and this was confirmed on cross examination. She also gave a differing account of the request for money; she stated that she asked her sister-in-law for money in October 2010, after she had rescinded her withdrawal.
[21]
The IAD also considered the evidence of the couple's communication with each other. Based on the brevity of their phone calls, the superficial content of their letters, and the fact that Mr Doherty did not know about Ms Granata's withdrawal of the sponsorship application, despite her evidence that she told him everything, the IAD concluded that the evidence of ongoing communication was weak and insubstantial.
[22]
The IAD accepted Ms Granata's evidence that neither financially supports the other, but that they had equally shared lottery winnings and Ms Granata had sent Mr Doherty two payments of $5,000 and $15,000 for his share.
[23]
The IAD also noted that although Ms Granata testified that she visited her husband while he was incarcerated in the US, after his deportation from Canada, there was no documentary evidence to substantiate these visits.
[24]
After finding the marriage to not be genuine, and due to the credibility findings, the negative inference drawn from Mr Doherty's failure to testify, the lack of credible explanations for the inconsistencies, and Mr Doherty's desire to enter and remain in Canada, given his immigration history, the IAD found that Ms Granata had not discharged the burden upon her and also concluded that the evidence demonstrated that the primary purpose of the marriage was to acquire status under the
Act
.
Issues
[25]
Ms Granata, the applicant, submits that the decision is not reasonable because the IAD erred by: misapprehending the facts or failing to take relevant evidence into consideration; relying on improper principles; and, making unreasonable credibility findings.
Standard of review
[26]
The genuineness of a marriage is a question of fact reviewable on the reasonableness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 271).
[27]
The role of the court on judicial review where the standard of reasonableness applies is to determine whether the Board's decision "falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). "There might be more than one reasonable outcome. However, as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility, it is not open to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome." (
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2009] 1SCR 339).
[28]
With respect to credibility, the IAD's credibility findings are findings of fact and are to be afforded significant deference by the reviewing Court. The IAD had the opportunity to hear and observe Ms Granata give her evidence in an oral hearing and is in the best position to assess her credibility.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 190, Justice Beaudry stated:
[20] The IAD, in a hearing de novo, is entitled to determine the plausibility and credibility of the testimony and other evidence before it. The weight to be assigned to that evidence is also a matter for the IAD to determine. As long as the conclusions and inferences drawn by the IAD are reasonably open to it on the record, there is no basis for interfering with its decision. Where an oral hearing has been held, more deference is accorded to the credibility findings.
The IAD decision is reasonable
[29]
The role of the Court is not to make a new decision but to determine if the IAD's decision was reasonable. In this case, the decision reached by the IAD, which is supported by the reasons and the record, is within the range of acceptable outcomes and is defensible. As noted below, the IAD commented on the lack of some documents that may have in fact been submitted; however, on their own or cumulatively, these misstatements were not significant or determinative of the decision.
Credibility
[30]
The IAD's negative credibility findings were well-founded. For example, Ms Granata and Mr Doherty had differing accounts of when they met and when their relationship began. The Board reasonably found these accounts to be inconsistent despite Ms Doherty's submissions to the Court that Mr Doherty clarified the dates in his interview and referred to his mistaken memory. The Board reasonably found the explanations not logical given that Mr Doherty married his first wife in April 2006, apparently after he met Ms Granata and, while that marriage was short-lived, there is some overlap in the dates.
[31]
The IAD also had serious concerns about Ms Granata's explanation of why she withdrew and then hastily reinstated her sponsorship application. In addition to discrepancies in their testimony, the IAD reasonably drew a negative inference from the fact that Mr Doherty did not testify at the hearing or otherwise attempt to clarify their conflicting evidence.
[32]
Ms Granata submits that the adverse inference is improper because only she could explain what she had told her husband about her withdrawal of sponsorship and because Mr Doherty was not aware, he could not have addressed this area of inconsistency. I do not agree. There were several inconsistencies in their accounts that could have been clarified if Mr Doherty had testified at the hearing. The determinative issue for the IAD was the withdrawal of sponsorship, the attempt to rescind the withdrawal, and the inconsistent accounts of when Ms Granata told Mr Doherty about this. Ms Granata now suggests that she may have only told Mr Doherty that she withdrew her sponsorship after his visa was refused in November 2010. A similar suggestion was made to the IAD at the hearing in her re-examination and the IAD noted that this was inconsistent with her testimony earlier in that hearing, which had also been confirmed on cross-examination. The IAD clearly did not accept this testimony. The participation of Mr Doherty at the hearing could have clarified when Ms Granata told him that she had withdrawn her sponsorship.
[33]
Given the negative credibility findings and the lack of documentary evidence provided by Ms Granata, it was reasonable for the IAD to conclude that, on a balance of probabilities, she did not visit her husband in the US while he was in detention. Ms Granata submits that there was such evidence on the record because both she and Mr Doherty said this occurred during their interviews. The IAD's finding, however, is not unreasonable because there was no supporting evidence on the record before the IAD and the IAD had found Ms Granata to be not credible. Ms Granata's submission that no records are maintained of such visits or that records are not available is not an adequate response. There would be many other ways to demonstrate regular visits to the US, including gas, food, transportation or accommodation receipts. The lack of documentary evidence suggests that no efforts were made to provide any records to substantiate the cross border visits.
[34]
Similarly, although Ms Granata submits that she and Mr Doherty did cohabit before and after their marriage, it was not unreasonable for the Board to find that there was no evidence to substantiate their cohabitation. The sponsorship application form lists a common address and the testimony of Mr Doherty at his first interview indicated that he lived with her at that address. Evidence to support cohabitation could take many forms, yet none was provided. The Board's finding was just that - there was no documentary evidence.
Communication and Relationship with their son
[35]
Ms Granata submits that there was ample evidence to demonstrate that she and Mr Doherty had a genuine relationship, together with their son. The IAD, however, concluded that the evidence of ongoing communication was weak and insubstantial. The IAD analyzed the cards and letters sent by Mr Doherty to Ms Granata and their son but found their content to be superficial. Such a finding was open to the IAD, given its experience in evaluating this type of correspondence. The IAD also noted the brevity, albeit regularity, of Ms Granata's telephone calls with her husband, most of which lasted under a minute. Furthermore, in response to Ms Granata's claim that she and her husband were very open with one another, the IAD reasonably placed significant weight on the fact that she had not told her husband about the actions she took to withdraw her sponsorship and then to rescind that withdrawal. Although Ms Granata indicated that she had told Mr Doherty about the withdrawal and rescission, she could not explain why he had no awareness of this when interviewed in November. The IAD reasonably concluded that Ms Granata and her husband, Mr Doherty, do not have meaningful ongoing communication with each other.
[36]
The IAD also reasonably concluded that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr Doherty did not have a solid relationship with his son, Nathan. The IAD considered written correspondence in which he wrote fondly of the child but also noted the lack of any photographs with Nathan. The IAD gave more probative weight to the latter. While photographs are not determinative as they can be created to depict relationships that may or may not be genuine, it is not the role of the Court to re-weigh the evidence considered by the IAD.
The First Marriage
[37]
I agree that the IAD's finding that Mr Doherty's first marriage to another Canadian citizen, who also sought to sponsor him and then withdrew sponsorship upon the breakdown of the marriage after five months, was not genuine, is not directly relevant to the IAD's determination whether the marriage to Ms Granata is genuine. The reference to Mr Doherty's first marriage was part of the overall background that the IAD was entitled to consider. As Ms Granata submits, marriages break down for various reasons and this first marriage was short-lived. However, the finding regarding the first marriage was not the determinative factor in the IAD's decision; the IAD considered many factors in reasonably concluding that Ms Granata had not established that the current marriage was genuine.
Marriage Certificate
[38]
Similarly, the IAD's reference that no marriage certificate was submitted merely reflects the confusion regarding whether the document was part of the package before the IAD. The record does indicate that an original certificate was provided to the visa post in Accra. Whether or not the certificate was provided to the IAD is not determinative. The IAD did not doubt that Ms Granata and Mr Doherty were legally married; the issue was the genuineness of the marriage.
The Withdrawal of Sponsorship
[39]
The applicant's withdrawal of sponsorship and subsequent rescission of the withdrawal was considered carefully by the IAD. It placed significant weight on this and on Ms Granata's inconsistent evidence about her reasons for doing so and when she had told Mr Doherty.
[40]
Ms Granata was repeatedly questioned at the IAD hearing about her actions and was given a full opportunity to explain her motivations, the source of the information that Mr Doherty was having an affair, and the timing of the letters, yet she was not able to provide a compelling, let alone, satisfactory explanation.
[41]
For example, when questioned by the respondent's counsel during the hearing, to clarify the testimony she had previously given on this issue, Ms Granata had little to say:
Q. ...So, he had his first interview [on August 5, 2010], everything was good. Then, they received the letters and that caused a few concerns. So, he was re-interviewed in November 2010, as per the record page[s] [25, 26]. So, he was re-interviewed in November 2010 just to look at the concerns. And when you look at the notes that were taken by the Visa officer, your husband had no clue about anything. He had no clue about the withdrawal. He had no clue about any issues that you two might have. So what do you think -- what happened there?
A. I don't know. I have an open relationship with my husband. We talk about everything.
Q. Okay. Can you be a little more detailed, like because that's really what refused the application is his -
A. I know.
Q. -- total ignorance about this whole situation, but you said that you talked to him two days after you put in the reinstatement letter.
A. Correct.
Q. So wouldn't in November -- what happened?
A. I spoke to my husband -- me and my husband, we have an open relationship.
[42]
The explanation offered did not line up at all with Mr Doherty's complete lack of knowledge about the withdrawal of sponsorship. This, coupled with the evidence of Ms Granata's request for money from Mr Doherty's sister, led the IAD to reasonably conclude that there was some other reason that motivated Ms Granata's actions.
Conclusion
[43]
It appears that the spousal sponsorship may have otherwise succeeded, given the visa officer's preliminary assessment in August 2010 that the marriage appeared genuine, but for the applicant's withdrawal of her sponsorship. The withdrawal then led to further questioning which revealed more inconsistencies in their accounts and which raised valid concerns about their credibility. The IAD gave the applicant, Ms Granata, ample opportunity to explain her actions and motivations and she could not do so to the satisfaction of the IAD.
[44]
The IAD reasonably concluded that Ms Granata had not met the burden upon her to satisfy on a balance of probabilities that the marriage was genuine and that it was not entered into primarily for Mr Doherty to acquire status under the
Act
. The burden rests on Ms Granata because she is the applicant and sponsor. However, the assessment of the genuineness and purpose of the marriage depended on the evidence of both Ms Granata and Mr Doherty. The IAD considered all the evidence before it and provided a thorough analysis and reasons that clearly indicate why the IAD determined that the relationship was not genuine and was entered into to acquire status under the
Act
.
JUDGMENT
[45]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review of the decision of the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board made on September 6, 2012 is dismissed.
2. There is no question for certification.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Granata, une citoyenne canadienne, a épousé M. Mobolaji Debayo-Doherty (M. Doherty), citoyen du Nigeria, le 25 février 2008. Elle a par la suite demandé à parrainer M. Doherty pour qu'il puisse immigrer au Canada. L'agent des visas a rejeté sa demande et il a été fait appel de ce refus. Mme Granata sollicite maintenant, en vertu de l'article 72 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la Loi], le contrôle judiciaire de la décision rendue le 6 septembre 2012 par la Section d'appel de l'immigration [la SAI] de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié, qui a rejeté son appel et a conclu que son mariage avec M. Doherty n'était pas authentique et visait principalement l'acquisition d'un statut sous le régime de la Loi.
[2]
Pour les motifs exposés ci-dessous, la demande est rejetée.
Le contexte
[3]
M. Doherty est citoyen du Nigeria, où il réside actuellement. En novembre 2003, il est entré au Canada depuis les États-Unis et a présenté une demande d'asile. En novembre 2004, l'asile lui a été refusé et sa demande d'autorisation d'en appeler a été rejetée. En mai 2006, la Cour a rejeté sa requête en sursis d'exécution de la mesure visant à l'expulser du Canada. En août 2006, un mandat a été émis en vue de son renvoi, lequel a eu lieu le 10 mars 2009. Le 12 mars 2009, M. Doherty a été expulsé du Canada vers les États-Unis. Il a été détenu par les autorités américaines jusqu'à son expulsion vers le Nigeria, en mai 2009.
[4]
Avant ces événements, soit en avril 2006, M. Doherty avait épousé une autre citoyenne canadienne. Sa conjointe et lui s'étaient séparés cinq mois plus tard et leur divorce avait été prononcé en octobre 2007. Il a eu un fils de cette union; celui-ci réside au Canada. Le 17 avril 2006, son ex-femme avait demandé à parrainer sa demande de résidence permanente, mais elle a retiré sa demande le 11 juin 2007.
[5]
Mme Granata a déposé sa propre demande de parrainage en octobre 2009, après l'expulsion de M. Doherty. Le 5 août 2010, celui-ci a été reçu en entrevue au bureau des visas situé à Accra. Au départ, l'agent des visas était convaincu de l'authenticité du mariage. Toutefois, avant que ne soit terminé le traitement de la demande de visa, le bureau des visas a reçu une lettre envoyée par Mme Granata le 30 juillet 2010 afin de retirer sa demande de parrainage. Deux semaines plus tard, elle a envoyé une nouvelle lettre dans laquelle elle revenait sur sa demande de retrait.
[6]
Le bureau des visas d'Accra a reçu M. Doherty pour une nouvelle entrevue le 15 novembre 2010. L'agent des visas a conclu à un échec du mariage qui avait incité Mme Granata à retirer sa demande de parrainage, malgré l'annulation subséquente de ce retrait. Il doutait de l'authenticité du mariage et du fait qu'il n'avait pas été contracté principalement aux fins d'immigration. Il a signifié le rejet de la demande de parrainage conjugal dans une lettre portant la date du 15 novembre 2010. Il a été fait appel de cette décision à la SAI.
La décision de la SAI
[7]
La SAI a observé que, pour obtenir gain de cause dans son appel, Mme Granata devait prouver que le mariage ne visait pas principalement à permettre à son mari, M. Doherty, d'acquérir un statut ou un privilège sous le régime de la Loi
et
qu'il était authentique.
[8]
Toutefois, pour pouvoir prononcer le rejet de l'appel, la SAI doit conclure
soit
que le mariage ne visait pas principalement l'acquisition d'un statut ou d'un privilège sous le régime de la Loi,
soit
qu'il n'est pas authentique.
[9]
Après avoir examiné les objectifs en matière d'immigration, dont celui de permettre la réunification des familles au Canada, la SAI a conclu que Mme Granata n'avait pas réussi à prouver, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le mariage était authentique
et
qu'il ne visait pas principalement l'acquisition d'un statut ou d'un privilège sous le régime de la Loi. Elle a fondé ses conclusions sur un examen de la preuve et des observations, y compris des éléments de preuve documentaire et des photographies, des factures de téléphone, la durée du mariage et le témoignage entendu à l'audience. La SAI a tiré une conclusion défavorable du fait que M. Doherty n'avait pas témoigné à l'audience. En outre, elle n'a pas jugé Mme Granata digne de foi, parce qu'en témoignage, elle s'était montrée vague, évasive, se contredisant elle-même ou contredisant les renseignements communiqués antérieurement et donnant des réponses qui, à certains égards, défiaient toute logique. Selon la SAI, du fait du manque de crédibilité de Mme Granata, la présomption de véracité de la preuve produite avait été réfutée.
[10]
La SAI a reconnu qu'en règle générale, le seul témoignage du demandeur suffit pour trancher la question de la bonne foi des intentions d'un couple et qu'il n'y a pas lieu de tirer une conclusion défavorable du défaut de témoigner de l'autre partie. Néanmoins, après avoir passé en revue la jurisprudence et les principes applicables du droit de la preuve, la SAI a tiré une conclusion défavorable du fait que M. Doherty n'a pas témoigné.
[11]
La SAI a invoqué l'ouvrage de John Sopinka, Sidney Lederman et Alan Bryant,
The Law of Evidence in Canada
, 2e éd. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999) ainsi que la jurisprudence où il est fait référence au traité sur la preuve du professeur Wigmore, notamment la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 116, dans laquelle sont relevés les facteurs qui sont pertinents pour décider s'il est raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'une personne témoigne et qui permettent de tirer une conclusion défavorable si elle ne le fait pas.
[12]
La SAI a constaté que l'affaire reposait en grande partie sur la crédibilité de Mme Granata et de M. Doherty et qu'elle n'avait pas eu la possibilité d'interroger M. Doherty au sujet des incohérences de leurs récits respectifs. La SAI a également conclu, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que M. Doherty savait qu'il y aurait une audience et qu'il a choisi de ne pas témoigner dans le cadre d'une conférence téléphonique.
[13]
Au paragraphe 25, la Commission écrit:
Comme il a déjà été indiqué, le tribunal a conclu que les éléments de preuve présentés par l'appelante n'étaient ni crédibles, ni dignes de foi ni fiables. Par conséquent, il est présumé qu'ils ne sont pas véridiques. Dans de telles circonstances, le fait que l'appelante n'ait pas appelé le demandeur à témoigner va, à la fois, à l'encontre de la logique et du bon sens et constitue donc un autre motif de ne pas présumer de la véracité du témoignage qu'elle a livré sous serment sur l'authenticité de son mariage. Le tribunal tire donc une conclusion défavorable du fait que le demandeur n'a pas témoigné à l'audience.
[14]
La Commission n'a pas jugé convaincante les raisons données par Mme Granata pour expliquer le fait que M. Doherty n'a pas témoigné: celle-ci a évoqué le manque de fiabilité du service téléphonique et le fait que M. Doherty se trouvait au travail, précisant qu'il aurait pu téléphoner de la ligne fixe de son domicile s'ils avaient su qu'il était souhaitable qu'il témoigne.
[15]
En ce qui concerne l'authenticité du mariage, la SAI a reconnu qu'il fallait tenir compte de nombreux facteurs pour juger de l'authenticité d'un mariage (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] ACF no 886). La Commission a examiné plusieurs facteurs puis a procédé à leur appréciation collectivement. Au final, elle a conclu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, le mariage n'était pas authentique.
[16]
La SAI a examiné la durée et le moment du premier mariage de M. Doherty et elle a conclu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, ce mariage n'était pas authentique et qu'il visait principalement l'acquisition d'un statut.
[17]
La SAI a également relevé les incohérences de leurs récits respectifs concernant le moment de leur première rencontre. Mme Granata a affirmé avoir rencontré M. Doherty en février 2006. Quant à M. Doherty, il a déclaré dans sa demande qu'on lui avait présenté Mme Granata le 21 février 2006. Toutefois, lors de son entrevue au bureau des visas, il a indiqué que leur première rencontre avait eu lieu vers la fin de 2006. La SAI n'a pas jugé convaincante l'explication qu'il a donnée de cet écart, notamment le fait qu'il avait confondu des dates. En outre, M. Doherty a déclaré qu'ils avaient commencé à se fréquenter peu après leur rencontre. Or, la Commission a remarqué que M. Doherty avait épousé sa première femme en avril 2006, ajoutant qu'il semblait illogique que M. Doherty ait pu rencontrer Mme Granata et commencer à la fréquenter en février 2006, peu de temps avant d'épouser sa première femme.
[18]
La SAI a remarqué que la demanderesse n'avait pas produit de photos des époux pour établir qu'ils s'étaient fréquentés et avaient fait vie commune, bien que des photos de la cérémonie du mariage sur lesquelles on pouvait apercevoir des gens en arrière-plan aient été versées au dossier.
[19]
La SAI a accepté le fait que le couple avait eu un fils, Nathan, quelques mois après leur mariage. Toutefois, elle a observé qu'aucune photo montrant M. Doherty avec leur fils n'avait été présentée, alors que l'expulsion de M. Doherty n'avait eu lieu que neuf mois après la naissance. La SAI a conclu à l'insuffisance d'éléments de preuve montrant l'existence d'une relation entre M. Doherty et son fils.
[20]
Concernant le retrait de la demande de parrainage de Mme Granata, la SAI a conclu qu'il y avait, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, une autre raison expliquant son geste. La SAI a jugé son explication ni convaincante ni crédible: elle a affirmé avoir retiré sa demande de parrainage parce qu'elle avait appris que son mari avait une liaison. En outre, lors de son entrevue au bureau des visas le 15 novembre 2010, M. Doherty ne savait rien du fait que Mme Granata avait retiré sa demande le 30 juillet 2010. Mis au fait de cette information et interrogé sur ce qui aurait pu motiver Mme Granata à faire ce geste, M. Doherty a émis l'hypothèse qu'elle avait peut-être eu besoin d'argent et demandé à la sœur de M. Doherty au Royaume-Uni de lui en prêter, mais il n'avait par ailleurs aucune idée de ce qui avait pu la pousser à retirer la demande. Or, devant la SAI, Mme Granata a affirmé sans équivoque qu'elle avait informé son mari de son geste peu après avoir envoyé la lettre à la fin de juillet et en août, et ce fait a été confirmé en contre-interrogatoire. Elle a également donné une version différente de la demande d'argent qu'elle avait adressée à sa belle-sœur, affirmant qu'elle l'avait fait en octobre 2010, après avoir annulé le retrait de sa demande.
[21]
La SAI a également examiné la preuve relative à la communication entre les conjoints. Considérant la brièveté de leurs appels téléphoniques, le caractère superficiel de leur correspondance écrite et le fait que M. Doherty n'était pas au courant du retrait de la demande de parrainage de Mme Granata alors que cette dernière, dans son témoignage, a déclaré lui avoir tout dit, la SAI a conclu que la preuve que les conjoints entretenaient une communication régulière était mince et insignifiante.
[22]
La SAI a prêté foi aux propos de Mme Granata selon lesquels aucun des conjoints ne subvenait aux besoins matériels de l'autre, et qu'ils s'étaient partagé des sommes gagnées à la loterie, Mme Granata ayant fait parvenir à M. Doherty deux paiements de 5 000 $ et 15 000 $ représentant sa part.
[23]
La SAI a par ailleurs noté que, même si Mme Granata avait déclaré qu'elle avait rendu visite à son mari aux États-Unis, où il avait été incarcéré après son expulsion du Canada, aucune preuve documentaire ne corroborait ces visites.
[24]
Ayant déterminé que le mariage n'était pas authentique, et au vu de ses conclusions en matière de crédibilité, de la conclusion défavorable qu'elle avait tirée quant au défaut de M. Doherty de témoigner, de l'absence d'explications crédibles concernant les contradictions et du désir de M. Doherty de venir au Canada et d'y rester, désir révélé par ses antécédents migratoires, la SAI a jugé que Mme Granata ne s'était pas acquittée du fardeau qui lui incombait et que la preuve démontrait que le mariage visait principalement l'acquisition d'un statut sous le régime de la Loi.
Les questions en litige
[25]
La demanderesse, Mme Granata, soutient que la décision est déraisonnable, la SAI ayant commis des erreurs en faisant une mauvaise appréciation des faits ou en négligeant de tenir compte d'éléments de preuve pertinents, en se fondant sur de mauvais principes et en tirant des conclusions déraisonnables en matière de crédibilité.
La norme de contrôle
[26]
Le caractère authentique d'un mariage est une question de fait à laquelle la norme de la raisonnabilité est applicable (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 43, aux paragraphes 16 et 17).
[27]
Lorsque la norme de la raisonnabilité s'applique, le rôle de la cour de révision est de décider de « l'appartenance de la décision [de la Commission] aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )). « Il peut exister plus d'une issue raisonnable. Néanmoins, si le processus et l'issue en cause cadrent bien avec les principes de justification, de transparence et d'intelligibilité, la cour de révision ne peut y substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable ». (
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 59).
[28]
En ce qui concerne la crédibilité, la SAI a tiré des conclusions de fait envers lesquelles la Cour, saisie du contrôle judiciaire, doit faire preuve d'une grande retenue. La SAI a eu la possibilité d'entendre et d'observer la déposition de Mme Granata à l'audience et elle est la mieux placée pour évaluer sa crédibilité. Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 190, au paragraphe 20, le juge Beaudry déclare ce qui suit:
[20] Dans une audition de novo, la SAI est en droit de déterminer la plausibilité et la crédibilité des témoignages et des autres éléments de preuve dont elle est saisie. L'importance qu'il faut accorder à cette preuve est également une question sur laquelle elle a le pouvoir de se prononcer. Tant et aussi longtemps que les conclusions et les inférences tirées par la SAI sont raisonnables au vu du dossier, il n'y a pas de raison de modifier sa décision.
La décision de la SAI est raisonnable
[29]
La Cour n'a pas pour mandat de rendre une nouvelle décision, mais bien de déterminer si la SAI a rendu une décision raisonnable. En l'espèce, la décision à laquelle la SAI est parvenue et qui est étayée par les motifs et le dossier appartient aux issues acceptables et peut se justifier. Comme nous le verrons plus loin, la SAI a émis des commentaires au sujet de l'absence de certains documents qui, en réalité, ont peut-être été produits; toutefois, ces inexactitudes, qu'elles soient considérées isolément ou dans leur ensemble, n'étaient ni importantes ni décisives quant à l'issue de l'affaire.
La crédibilité
[30]
Les conclusions défavorables tirées par la SAI en matière de crédibilité étaient fondées. Par exemple, Mme Granata et M. Doherty ont offert des versions différentes de leur première rencontre et du moment où ils ont commencé leur relation. La Commission a conclu à juste titre que ces récits ne concordaient pas, même si Mme Doherty a signalé à la Cour que M. Doherty avait donné des éclaircissements quant aux dates lors de son entrevue et qu'il avait fait allusion à sa mémoire déficiente. Il était raisonnable que la Commission juge ces explications illogiques, vu que M. Doherty a épousé sa première femme en avril 2006, c'est-à-dire, à ce qu'il paraît, après sa rencontre avec Mme Granata et que, même si ce mariage a été de courte durée, les dates se chevauchent dans une certaine mesure.
[31]
De même, la SAI a exprimé de sérieuses réserves concernant les raisons données par Mme Granata pour expliquer pourquoi elle avait retiré sa demande de parrainage pour ensuite annuler ce retrait à la hâte. En plus de signaler les contradictions dans leurs témoignages respectifs, la SAI a tiré une conclusion défavorable du fait que M. Doherty n'avait pas témoigné à l'audience ni tenté de résoudre les contradictions en donnant des éclaircissements.
[32]
Mme Granata soutient que cette conclusion défavorable n'est pas justifiée puisqu'elle était la seule à pouvoir expliquer ce qu'elle avait dit à son mari au sujet du retrait de la demande de parrainage et puisque M. Doherty, n'étant au courant de rien, n'était pas en mesure de résoudre cette contradiction. Je ne partage pas cet avis. Le témoignage de M. Doherty à l'audience aurait permis d'élucider plusieurs incohérences dans leurs récits. Pour la SAI, les aspects déterminants de l'affaire étaient le retrait de la demande de parrainage, la tentative d'annuler ce retrait et les versions contradictoires qui avaient été données au sujet du moment où Mme Granata avait fait part de son geste à M. Doherty. Mme Granata laisse maintenant entendre qu'il est possible qu'elle n'ait parlé du retrait de sa demande de parrainage à M. Doherty qu'après le rejet de sa demande de visa en novembre 2010. Elle a laissé entendre sensiblement la même chose lors de son contre-interrogatoire devant la SAI; cette dernière a souligné que cela venait contredire les déclarations qu'elle avait faites plus tôt à l'audience, en interrogatoire principal, et qui avaient également été confirmées en contre-interrogatoire. La SAI a catégoriquement refusé ce témoignage. La participation de M. Doherty à l'audience aurait pu permettre de déterminer avec précision à quel moment il avait appris de Mme Granata le retrait de la demande de parrainage.
[33]
Compte tenu des conclusions défavorables qu'elle avait tirées quant à la crédibilité et du fait que Mme Granata n'avait produit aucune preuve documentaire, la SAI pouvait conclure à juste titre, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la demanderesse n'avait pas rendu visite à son mari alors qu'il était détenu aux États-Unis. Mme Granata prétend que le dossier prouve que ces visites ont eu lieu étant donné que M. Doherty et elle-même y ont tous deux fait allusion lors de leur entrevue. Toutefois, la SAI n'a pas tiré une conclusion déraisonnable, car le dossier qui lui avait été soumis ne comportait aucune preuve à l'appui et elle avait jugé que Mme Granata n'était pas digne de foi. L'observation de Mme Granata voulant qu'aucun registre des visites ne soit tenu ou qu'il soit impossible d'obtenir ces registres n'est pas une réponse suffisante. Il existe bien d'autres façons de démontrer qu'elle a régulièrement rendu visite à son mari aux États-Unis, notamment en présentant des reçus d'essence, de repas ou d'hébergement. L'absence de preuve documentaire permet de penser qu'aucun effort n'a été fait pour fournir des documents étayant ces visites effectuées de l'autre côté de la frontière.
[34]
De la même façon, bien que Mme Granata soutienne que M. Doherty et elle ont fait vie commune avant et après leur mariage, il n'était pas déraisonnable que la Commission conclue à l'absence de preuve corroborant cette vie commune. Dans la demande de parrainage, une adresse commune est indiquée et M. Doherty, lors de sa première entrevue, a affirmé qu'il avait vécu avec sa femme à cette adresse. La preuve de la cohabitation peut prendre bien des formes. Or, aucune n'a été produite. La conclusion de la Commission se limitait au constat de l'absence de preuve documentaire.
La communication et la relation avec le fils
[35]
Mme Granata soutient qu'il y avait amplement d'éléments de preuve démontrant que M. Doherty et elle avaient une relation authentique, entre eux et avec leur fils. Toutefois, la SAI a conclu que la preuve de l'existence d'une communication régulière était mince et insignifiante. La SAI a examiné les cartes et les lettres que M. Doherty a envoyées à Mme Granata et à leur fils et a jugé leur contenu superficiel. La SAI était autorisée à tirer cette conclusion, en raison de l'expérience qu'elle a acquise dans l'évaluation de ce genre de correspondance. La SAI a également constaté que les conversations téléphoniques entre Mme Granata et son mari, quoique régulières, restaient néanmoins très brèves, la plupart durant moins d'une minute. De plus, en réponse à l'argument de Mme Granata selon lequel son mari et elle faisaient preuve d'une grande franchise l'un envers l'autre, la SAI a accordé, à juste titre, une grande importance au fait qu'elle n'avait pas informé son mari des mesures qu'elle avait prises pour retirer sa demande de parrainage, puis pour annuler ce retrait. Bien qu'elle ait affirmé avoir mis M. Doherty au courant du retrait et de l'annulation, Mme Granata n'a pas été en mesure d'expliquer pourquoi ce dernier n'en savait rien au moment de son entrevue, en novembre. La SAI en a conclu, à juste titre, que Mme Granata et son mari, M. Doherty, n'entretiennent pas une communication valable et suivie.
[36]
La SAI est aussi arrivée à la conclusion raisonnable que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, M. Doherty n'avait pas de liens solides avec son fils, Nathan. La SAI a examiné des lettres témoignant de son affection pour l'enfant, mais elle a également remarqué l'absence de photos de Nathan et lui. Elle a accordé plus de valeur probante à ce dernier élément. S'il est vrai que les photographies n'ont pas un caractère déterminant puisqu'elles peuvent servir à créer de toutes pièces des relations qui ne sont pas authentiques, il n'appartient pas à la Cour de procéder à une nouvelle appréciation de la preuve examinée par la SAI.
Le premier mariage
[37]
Concernant le fait que la SAI a jugé non authentique le premier mariage de M. Doherty avec une citoyenne canadienne qui a voulu le parrainer puis a retiré sa demande de parrainage au moment de l'échec du mariage, cinq mois plus tard, je reconnais qu'il n'existe aucun rapport direct entre cette conclusion et la question de savoir si son mariage avec Mme Granata est authentique. Le premier mariage de M. Doherty faisait partie des éléments contextuels généraux que la SAI était autorisée à examiner. Ainsi que l'affirme Mme Granata, diverses raisons peuvent expliquer l'échec d'une union et ce premier mariage a été de courte durée. Cela dit, la conclusion tirée quant au premier mariage ne s'est pas révélée un facteur déterminant dans la décision de la SAI; celle-ci a tenu compte de nombreux facteurs pour en venir à conclure, à juste titre, que Mme Granata n'avait pas établi l'authenticité du mariage actuel.
Le certificat de mariage
[38]
De la même façon, l'allusion de la SAI au fait qu'aucun certificat de mariage n'avait été produit n'est que le reflet de la confusion qui régnait autour de la question de savoir si le document faisait partie du dossier déposé auprès du tribunal. Il est effectivement écrit au dossier qu'un certificat original a été remis au bureau des visas situé à Accra. Le fait que ce certificat ait ou non été présenté à la SAI n'est pas déterminant. La SAI n'a jamais remis en doute la légalité du mariage de Mme Granata et de M. Doherty; le litige portait sur l'authenticité de ce mariage.
Le retrait de la demande de parrainage
[39]
La SAI a soigneusement examiné la question du retrait de la demande de parrainage et son annulation postérieure. Elle y a accordé une grande importance, comme aux déclarations contradictoires de Mme Granata au sujet des raisons qui l'ont poussée à agir ainsi et du moment où elle en a informé M. Doherty.
[40]
À l'audience devant la SAI, Mme Granata a été interrogée à maintes reprises au sujet de ses actes et a eu amplement l'occasion d'exposer ses motivations, d'indiquer d'où elle tenait l'information selon laquelle M. Doherty avait une liaison et de situer les lettres dans le temps. Or, elle a été incapable de fournir une explication probante, encore moins convaincante.
[41]
Par exemple, à l'audience, lorsque l'avocat du défendeur l'a interrogée afin de clarifier le témoignage qu'elle avait donné antérieurement sur cette question, Mme Granata avait peu à dire:
[traduction]
Q. [...] Ainsi, il a eu sa première entrevue [le 5 août 2010], tout se passait bien. Puis, ils ont reçu les lettres, ce qui a provoqué quelques problèmes. Il a donc été convoqué à une seconde entrevue en novembre 2010, d'après le dossier, page[s] [25, 26]. Bon, on lui a posé d'autres questions en novembre 2010 simplement pour examiner ces problèmes. Et si vous jetez un œil aux notes prises par l'agent des visas, vous verrez que votre mari n'était au courant de rien. Il n'était pas au courant du retrait. Il n'était pas au courant des problèmes qu'il pouvait y avoir entre vous. Alors, qu'en pensez-vous? Que s'est-il passé?
R. Je ne sais pas. J'ai avec mon mari une relation franche. Nous nous disons tout.
Q. Très bien. Pourriez-vous être un peu plus précise, car vraiment, ce qui a provoqué le rejet de sa demande, c'est sa ...
R. Je sais.
Q. ...complète ignorance de la situation, mais vous avez dit que vous lui aviez parlé deux jours après l'envoi de la lettre de rétablissement de la demande.
R. C'est exact.
Q. Donc, en novembre ... que s'est-il produit?
R. J'ai parlé à mon mari ... Mon mari et moi, nous avons une relation franche.
[42]
La réponse donnée n'expliquait nullement le fait que M. Doherty ne sache strictement rien du retrait de la demande de parrainage. Ce fait, conjugué à la preuve de la demande d'argent que Mme Granata a adressée à la sœur de M. Doherty, a mené la SAI à la conclusion raisonnable qu'une autre raison était à l'origine du geste de Mme Granata.
Conclusion
[43]
N'eût été le retrait de la demande de parrainage conjugal, celle-ci aurait eu des chances d'être acceptée puisqu'en août 2010, à l'issue d'un examen préliminaire, l'agent des visas avait jugé que le mariage paraissait authentique. Le retrait a donné lieu à des interrogatoires plus approfondis qui ont révélé l'existence d'autres contradictions dans le récit des conjoints et ont donné naissance à des doutes légitimes quant à leur crédibilité. La SAI a offert à la demanderesse, Mme Granata, une possibilité réelle d'expliquer ses actes et ses motivations. Or, elle n'a pas su le faire à la satisfaction de la SAI.
[44]
La SAI a donc conclu, à juste titre, que Mme Granata ne s'était pas acquittée du fardeau de prouver, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le mariage était authentique et qu'il ne visait pas principalement à permettre à M. Doherty d'acquérir un statut sous le régime de la Loi. C'est à Mme Granata qu'incombait le fardeau de la preuve puisqu'elle est demanderesse et répondante. Cela dit, l'évaluation de l'authenticité et de la finalité du mariage dépendait à la fois du témoignage de Mme Granata et de celui de M. Doherty. La SAI a tenu compte de toute la preuve dont elle disposait, en plus de procéder à une analyse rigoureuse et de fournir des motifs qui expliquent clairement pourquoi elle a conclu que la relation n'était pas authentique et qu'elle visait l'acquisition d'un statut sous le régime de la Loi.

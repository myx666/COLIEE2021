 Rouleau, J. 
 
 November 18, 1986.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Summary: 
 
 A prison inmate was convicted of the disciplinary offence of behaving towards another person, by his language, in a threatening manner pursuant to s. 39(g) of the Penitentiary Service Regulations. The inmate applied under s. 18 of the Federal Court Act for certiorari to quash the conviction.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, stated that the inmate may have been charged with the wrong offence. The court invited submissions from both counsel on this point before rendering its decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Administrative Law - Topic 8930 
 
 Boards and tribunals - Powers - Procedure - A tribunal such as an inmate disciplinary court has the power to establish its own procedure - The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, held, however, that the question of whether charges against an inmate should be stayed or dismissed was a substantive issue, not procedural and therefore could not be determined by the disciplinary court, but must be determined by authorities responsible for laying the charge in the first place - See paragraphs 15 to 16.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Courts - Topic 4023 
 
 Federal Court of Canada - Jurisdiction - Trial Division - Prison inmates - The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, held that it had no jurisdiction, when reviewing the decision-making process of an inmate disciplinary court under s. 18 of the Federal Court Act, to stay or dismiss the charge against the inmate; at most the court has the power to quash the decision of the inferior tribunal where proper grounds are shown - See paragraph 17.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Prisons - Topic 1023 
 
 Administration - Powers re prisoners - Disciplinary offences - The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, held that the decision as to whether an inmate should be charged with a disciplinary offence and whether circumstances warrant dropping or dismissing the charges is clearly within the jurisdiction of the head of the institution - The independent chairperson of the disciplinary court has only three functions pursuant to statute: (1) to preside over a disciplinary court (Reg. 38.1(1)); (2) to determine the innocence or guilt of an inmate based on the evidence presented at the hearing (Reg. 38(5)(a)); and (3) to impose an appropriate punishment for the offence (Reg. 38 (5)(b)) - The chairperson has no jurisdiction to stay or dismiss the charges against the inmate - See paragraphs 8 to 14.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Discipline - Inmates - Offences - Threats - Mens rea or intention - An inmate was charged with the disciplinary offence of behaving toward another person, by his language, in a threatening manner, contrary to s. 39(g) of the Penitentiary Service Regulations - The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, held that the mens rea of the offence was the intent to speak the words while the actus reus of the offence was the actual speaking of the words - The court held that the intention to carry out the threat was irrelevant and did not constitute an element of the offence - See paragraph 19.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Prisons - Topic 1548 
 
 Discipline - Inmates - Offences - Threats - S. 39(b) of the Penitentiary Service Regulations created the offence of an inmate threatening to assault another person, where an offence was created even though the threatened person did not hear the threat or be in the presence of the inmate when the threat was made - The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, contrasted the offence in s. 39 (g) of the Regulations of behaving towards another person in a threatening manner, which required that the recipient of the threat be witness to such behaviour - See paragraphs 21 to 22.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Rouleau, J. 
 : This motion by the applicant is made pursuant to s. 18 of the Federal Court Act for an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision of the respondent convicting the applicant of an offence pursuant to paragraph 39(g) of the Penitentiary Service Regulations, C.R.C. 1978, c. 1251, s. 40 as am.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The applicant is an inmate of Kent Institution in British Columbia serving a sentence of approximately eleven years and three months which commenced in 1981. The applicant's projected mandatory supervision release date is sometime in February of 1989.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  On June 15, 1985, the applicant was incarcerated in the General Population of Kent Institution where he alleges he was being threatened by other inmates. The applicant, concerned that he was in danger of being physically attacked, requested that he be placed in protective custody. Thereafter the applicant was placed in the protective custody area of the Administrative and Punitive Dissociation Unit in Kent Institution, commonly called the J-Unit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  On June 26, 1985, the applicant appeared before the Segregation Review Board and was asked to provide the names of the prisoners who had threatened him and those whom the applicant believed wished to cause him physical harm. The applicant refused to supply the prison officials with any names for fear of the consequences of doing so. In paragraph 4 of his affidavit sworn on April 3, 1986, the applicant states:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "[...] The reason I did this was because any repercussions against these individuals would be easily traced to me as I had just signed myself into Protective Custody. Even if I had remained in Protective Custody until the end of my sentence, I was apprehensive that I would be severely injured or killed upon my release from prison in 1989, in retaliation. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [5] 
  On June 28, 1985, the applicant was interviewed by two Living Unit Officers of the institution and was advised that, in order to remain in protective custody, he would be required to supply prison officials with the names of those inmates of whom he was afraid. After his refusal to comply with these repeated requests, the applicant was in the process of being returned to General Population when he stated that if he was put into General Population he would kill the next officer he saw.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The applicant's evidence is that he knew such action would result in his being charged with a disciplinary offence for issuing a threat and being placed in segregation, thereby avoiding the danger of being placed in General Population. The applicant was in fact charged with an offence pursuant to paragraph 39(g) of the Penitentiary Service Regulations. However, the applicant maintains that at no time did he possess the intention of carrying out the threat; it was simply a threat uttered for the secondary purpose of remaining in protective custody.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  On August 8, 1985, a Disciplinary Court hearing took place wherein the applicant was found by the respondent Independent Chairperson to be guilty of committing a disciplinary offence pursuant to paragraph 39(g) of the Penitentiary Service Regulations. The applicant now seeks to have that decision quashed on the grounds that the respondent acted in excess of or without jurisdiction by failing to exercise his discretion to entertain a preliminary application to stay the charge against the applicant or, alternatively, if the respondent has no jurisdiction to stay the charge, that this court has authority to do so in its supervisory capacity over the decision-making process of an inferior tribunal. In addition, the applicant argues that the respondent misdirected himself in law by finding that mens rea was not a necessary element of the charge against the applicant and by failing to consider and apply the defence of necessity and/or duress to the evidence before him.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  During the course of the Disciplinary Court hearing on August 8, 1985, the applicant made a preliminary application to have the respondent stay the charge. Generally in criminal proceedings the decision to stay charges is made by the Crown Attorney. The effect of such a decision is that although the charges are not dealt with immediately it remains open to the crown to proceed with them at some future date. Staying a charge is not equivalent to "dropping" or "dismissing" a charge. My understanding, however, is that the respondent was being requested by applicant's counsel to entertain an application to withdraw or drop the charges. This view is supported by a letter sent to Mr. Guinet by counsel for the applicant dated July 24, 1985, wherein it was requested that he exercise his discretion and agree to drop the charge against the applicant. The respondent declined to entertain the preliminary application at the Disciplinary Court hearing on the grounds that he did not consider himself to be vested with the discretion to deal with such a matter.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  The applicant argued before me that s. 38 of the Penitentiary Service Regulations afforded the respondent with the discretion to make a decision concerning a stay of the charge and that by failing to exercise that discretion he acted in excess of or without jurisdiction.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  I do not agree with the applicant's submission on this matter. My examination of the relevant portions of ss. 38 and 38.1 of the Regulations does not reveal any discretion in this regard on the part of the respondent. Sections 38(1), (2) and (5), and s. 38.1 of the Penitentiary Service Regulations provide as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "38(1) The institutional head of each institution is responsible for the disciplinary control of inmates confined therein.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(2) Where an inmate commits a disciplinary offence listed in section 39, punishment for the offence may be imposed by  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) the institutional head or an officer of the Service designated by him; or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) a disciplinary court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(5) The person referred to in paragraph (2)(a) or the court referred to in paragraph 2(b) shall  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) determine the innocence or guilt of an inmate based on the evidence presented at the hearing; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) order such punishment referred to in subsections (7), (8) and (9) as he deems suitable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "38.1(1) The Minister may appoint a person to preside over a disciplinary court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(2) The remuneration of a person appointed by the Minister under subsection (1) shall be $250 for each day or portion thereof that he presides over a disciplinary court and $75 per hour up to a maximum of $250 per day for the following other duties that he is required to perform, namely,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) participation in information sessions,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) participation in orientation and training sessions,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) participation in consultation sessions with staff members, union members or inmates, and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) appearance before a court in his capacity as president of a disciplinary court in order to reply to proceedings resulting from the discharge of his duties, plus travelling expenses in accordance with the Treasury Board travel directive.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(3) Where a hearing is conducted by a person appointed by the Minister under subsection (1), the institutional head shall designate one or two officers of the Service with major responsibilities within the institution, who had no direct involvement in the incident giving rise to the hearing, to assist that person during the hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(4) The officers designated pursuant to subsection (3) shall  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) provide any details or documents requested by the person appointed by the Minister under subsection (1), and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) during the deliberations on the imposition of a punishment, advise the person appointed by the Minister when requested to do so on the most appropriate punishment having regard to administrative constraints and the involvement of the inmate in the various institutional programs,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 but the officers shall not otherwise intervene during the hearing unless the person appointed by the Minister requests or authorizes them to do so. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [11] 
  According to these provisions it is the institutional head of each institution which is responsible for the discipline of inmates. Pursuant to s. 38(5) the duty of the Disciplinary Court is to determine the innocence or guilt of an inmate and then to impose the punishment prescribed by the Regulations which the court deems appropriate in the circumstances. Those are the only powers conferred upon the Disciplinary Court by the Regulations aside from s. 38(13) which allows the court to order that a punishment imposed not be carried out on certain conditions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  Section 38.1 of the Regulations is the legislative authority for the creation of a disciplinary court and allows for the appointment of an independent chairperson to preside over that court. The regulation sets out the remuneration and duties of the chairperson.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  None of these legislative provisions bestow any authority on the respondent to stay the charges against the applicant. The decision as to whether an inmate should be charged with a disciplinary offence and whether circumstances warrant dropping or dismissing those charges is clearly within the ambit of jurisdiction of the head of the institution. The independent chairperson of the disciplinary court, in this case the respondent, is clearly charged with only three functions pursuant to the legislation: 1) to preside over a disciplinary court [Regulation 38.1(1)]; 2) to determine the innocence or guilt of an inmate based on the evidence presented at the hearing [Regulation 38(5)(a)]; and, 3) to impose an appropriate punishment for the offence [Regulation 38(5)(b)].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  I am satisfied therefore that the respondent did not act in excess of or without jurisdiction when he failed to entertain the applicant's preliminary application to stay the charge against the applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The applicant further argued that the respondent had the discretion to dismiss the charges on the basis that it was within the power of the respondent, in the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary, to establish its own procedure. Counsel relied on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The principle that a tribunal, such as the Disciplinary Court, is the master of its own procedure is a well-established principle of law. However, the question of whether charges should be stayed or dismissed is not a procedural issue but a substantive one to be determined by those individuals responsible for the laying of the charge in the first place.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Accordingly, the fact that a disciplinary court is the master of its own procedure does not bestow on it any discretion not otherwise provided for by statute to withdraw the charge against the applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  As for the applicant's alternative argument that this court has jurisdiction in its supervisory capacity to stay the charge, I cannot agree. The remedies available to the applicant pursuant to a review of this nature are clearly set out in s. 18 of the Federal Court Act. Certiorari, which permits the court to review the record of an inferior tribunal and to quash the order where proper grounds are shown, is one of the general remedies available to the court when exercising its supervisory function over the decision making of a public body. However, the court is not empowered in its supervisory capacity to make the type of decision which the applicant is requesting. As I have already stated, the decision to stay the charge does not rest with the Disciplinary Court. This court is not conducting a procedural review of that decision-making process, i.e. the withdrawing of charges, rests with the head of the institution; at the most it has the power to quash the decision of an inferior tribunal where proper grounds are shown.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  The second ground on which the applicant seeks the remedy of certiorari is that the respondent misdirected himself in law by finding that mens rea was not a necessary element of the charge against the applicant. Section 39 of the Penitentiary Service Regulations provides as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "39. Every inmate is guilty of a disciplinary offence who  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) disobeys or fails to obey a lawful order of a penitentiary officer,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) assaults or threatens to assault another person,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) refuses to work or fails to work to the best of his ability,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) leaves his work without permission of a penitentiary officer,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (e) wilfully or negligently damages any property of Her Majesty or the property of another person,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (f) wilfully wastes food,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (g) behaves toward any other person, by his actions, language or writing, in an indecent, disrespectful, threatening or defamatory manner,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (h) wilfully disobeys or fails to obey any regulation or rule governing the conduct of inmates,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (i) has contraband in his possession,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (i.1) consumes, absorbs, swallows, smokes, inhales, injects or otherwise uses an intoxicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (j) deals in contraband with any other person,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (k) does any act that is calculated to prejudice the discipline or good order of the institution,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (l) does any act with intent to escape or to assist another inmate to escape,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (l.1) is in an area prohibited to inmates,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (m) gives or offers a bribe or reward to any person for any purpose,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (n) contravenes any rule, regulation or directive made under the Act, or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (o) attempts to do anything mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (n). <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 Counsel for the applicant maintains that, in the circumstances of this case, it is clear that the applicant did not possess the intent to carry out his threat of killing a staff member and only uttered the threat in order to remain in protective custody. Accordingly, the applicant argues that the necessary mens rea was not present and the offence with which the applicant has been charged under paragraph 39(g) has not been made out.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  With due respect to counsel it is my opinion that they have misdirected themselves on this issue of mens rea. The mens rea attached to the offence of threatening another party by one's language is the intent to speak the words while the actus reus of the offence is the actual speaking of the words. The question of whether the person who actually says the threatening words has the intention of carrying out the threat is irrelevant; that intention does not constitute an element of the offence of threatening another person by one's language. It is immaterial whether those who heard the threat or those being threatened appreciated that the words were uttered for a secondary motive. It is only required that the person accused of the offence in paragraph 39(g) of the Regulations actually behaved by his language in a threatening manner. Accordingly, an inmate charged with an offence pursuant to paragraph 39(g) does not need to possess the intention of actually carrying out the threat in order to be guilty of the offence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  On this basis, therefore, one might be inclined to reach the conclusion that the applicant in this case was guilty of the offence with which he was charged. However, in my opinion, the accused may not be guilty of an offence pursuant to paragraph 39(g) of the Regulations for the following reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  In interpreting s. 39 of the Penitentiary Service Regulations one must look at the whole section and not just the particular paragraph in question. In this regard, paragraph 39(b) deals with the offence of an inmate threatening to assault another person. I understand the words of that paragraph to create an offence where an inmate threatens to assault a person even though the threatened person did not hear the inmate threaten him nor was he in the presence of the inmate when the threat was made. Therefore, it would be sufficient for one inmate to say to another that he was going to kill the first officer he saw in order to have committed the offence set out in paragraph 39(b). When one continues to read regulation 39 and comes upon paragraph (g), the question which arises is what offence is created by those words in light of the preceding paragraphs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  The distinction between the two paragraphs is that pursuant to (g), an inmate, in order to have committed an offence, must have behaved towards another person in a threatening manner. The phrase "behaves towards another person", in my view, contemplates that the party who is the subject of the threat is in the presence of the inmate who is issuing the threat; that is, in order for an inmate to behave toward any other person by his language in a threatening manner the other person must be the direct recipient of and be witness to such behavior. If paragraph 39(g) were afforded an alternative interpretation so as to include as an offence any threat uttered by an inmate at any time, it would be redundant with the offence set out in paragraph (b) and would virtually render the word "behaves" as it appears in paragraph (g) void of any meaning. Such an interpretation would be contrary with the general principle of statutory interpretation that the construction that gives effect to the whole of the provision under consideration should be adopted in preference to one that renders part thereof meaningless.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Viscount Simon stated at pp. 546-547:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "[...] though a Parliamentary enactment (like parliamentary eloquence) is capable of saying the same thing twice over without adding anything to what has been said once, this repetition in the case of an  
 Act 
  of Parliament is not to be assumed.  
 When the legislature enacts a particular phrase in a statute the presumption is that it is saying something which has not been said immediately before 
 ." (Emphasis added)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  From this reasoning, therefore, it appears that the applicant in this case may have been charged with the wrong offence. The officers who were present when the applicant stated that if he were put into General Population he would kill the next officer he saw were clearly not the subject of the threat. Therefore, it may be that the applicant did not behave towards them in a threatening manner. What the applicant did in fact do was threaten to assault another person; that is, as I perceive it, the offence contemplated by paragraph 39(b).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  Because this issue was not addressed by counsel in the course of the hearing before me, I think the appropriate action in this matter is to have both counsel make submissions on this point before I render a decision. Accordingly, I am ordering the applicant to provide to the respondent and to file with this court written submissions within twenty days of this order on the issue of whether the applicant has been charged with the proper offence pursuant to regulation 39. The respondent will be afforded twenty days from the date of receiving the applicant's submissions to file his written arguments with the court and to serve them on the applicant. Thereafter, the applicant will have ten days to file and serve a reply.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Order accordingly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

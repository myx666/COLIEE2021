INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC- 2001, c. 27 (Act) for judicial review of the decision of a Visa Officer (Officer) of the High Commission of Canada in New Delhi, India, dated 21 November 2011 (Decision), which refused the Applicant's application for permanent residence in Canada as a member of the Skilled Worker class.
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicant in a citizen of India. He submitted an application for Permanent Residence as a Federal Skilled Worker at the High Commission of Canada in New Delhi, India. His application was refused because he failed to submit the documentation requested by the Officer.
[3]
The Applicant first submitted his application at the High Commission in New Delhi on 18 April 2010. This application was rejected due to an error in calculating his adaptability points. The Applicant filed an application for judicial review which resulted in the Respondent making an offer to settle. The Applicant accepted the offer on 10 April 2011 and the file was sent back to the High Commission for determination.
[4]
Not having heard anything, the Applicant sent a letter to the High Commission dated 24 May 2011 inquiring about the status of his application. On 3 August 2011, someone from the High Commission called the Applicant's home and asked to speak with him. The Applicant was not home, but his wife gave the caller the Applicant's cell phone number.
[5]
On 8 August 2011, the Applicant was contacted by someone from the High Commission who asked him to provide complete copies of the passport of every member of his family, as well as a copy of his older son's refusal letter with respect to a student visa application.
[6]
On 22 August 2011, the Applicant sent the requested documents to the High Commission via Blue Dart (the DHL agent in India). These documents were tracked, and were delivered on 23 August 2011. The Applicant provided a copy of the delivery confirmation. The copies of the passports provided by the Applicant in this package were not complete; he had only provided a copy of the biography page and the last page from each of his children's passports.
[7]
The Respondent says that it sent a letter to the Applicant on 22 September 2011 advising him that he had 30 days to provide complete copies of all passports. A copy of this letter is found on page 41 of the Certified Tribunal Record. This letter was sent by regular mail, without tracking or confirmation of delivery. The Applicant says that he never received the letter and did not know that the copies of the passports were incomplete.
[8]
On 16 November 2011, the Officer reviewed the file and determined that the background checks could not be properly completed without the requested documentation. The application was refused on 21 November 2011. On 13 December 2011, the Applicant received a letter dated 21 November 2011 stating that his application had been refused because he did not provide copies of complete passports (old and new) for himself and his family members.
[9]
Not understanding what had happened, the Applicant sent a letter to the High Commission on 13 December 2011 stating that he had never received the 22 September 2011 letter. There was no reply to this letter. On 21 December 2011, the Applicant sent another letter to the High Commission explaining that his immigration matter is of high interest to him, that he initially applied in 2010, and that he would not simply neglect to forward the requested documents.
[10]
On 13 January 2012, the Applicant's counsel received an email from the High Commission stating that they were unable to trace the package that was delivered to them by Blue Dart on 22 August 2011. On 17 January 2012, the Applicant's counsel replied by email and enclosed the status report of the Blue Dart package.
The Applicant's counsel advised the High Commission that, if necessary, he would forward all the required documents again
. The Applicant's counsel also advised the High Commission that time was of the essence because the Applicant only had 60 days from the receipt of the refusal letter to make an application for judicial review.
[11]
On 31 January 2012, the Applicant's counsel received a response from the High Commission stating that counsel's e-mail had been forwarded to the appropriate section. Applicant's counsel responded by email on the same day, again requesting confirmation of receipt of the 22 September 2011 letter.
[12]
On 10 February 2012, the Applicant filed this application for judicial review. On 15 February 2012, Applicant's counsel received an email from the High Commission stating that the Applicant's file was with a Visa Officer and was under review. On 20 February 2012, the Applicant's counsel received a copy of a letter indicating the Applicant's application for Permanent Residence had been refused.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[13]
The Decision in this case consists of a letter dated 21 November 2011 (Refusal Letter), and the Officer's notes to the file (Notes).
[14]
The Refusal Letter, found on page 156 of the Applicant's Record, states that the Applicant was asked on 8 August 2011 to produce copies of complete passports (old and new) for himself and his family members. It then states that a reminder was sent to the Applicant on 22 September 2011, informing him that he had 30 days to provide these documents and that if they were not provided his application would be assessed based on the information already before the Officer. The Refusal Letter stated that, to date, the High Commission still had not received these documents, and thus the Applicant's application was denied because he had not met the requirements of subsection 11(1) of the Act and the Officer was not satisfied that the Applicant was not inadmissible.
[15]
The Officer's Notes start by reviewing the procedural history of the application. The entry dated 1 August 2011 says that the Applicant's son, Angkon, indicated that he had not been issued any previous refusals, but in fact he has been refused two study permits. The Notes indicate that the Applicant should be contacted and told that the documents for his son were not completed properly. The Notes from 8 August 2011 say that the Officer spoke with the Applicant and told him to provide full copies of passports for the entire family, and that the Applicant confirmed that he would forward the documents. The documents were marked as received on 8 September 2011.
[16]
The Notes on 21 September 2011 state that the requested documents were not received and that a letter should be prepared for the Applicant requesting the additional information. The Notes say the letter was prepared and mailed on 22 September 2011.
[17]
The Officer wrote in the Notes on 15 November 2011 as follows:
BCrim is outstanding. Based on the fact that the application originally submitted false information pertaining to his son's study permit refusal, I am not prepared to make a BCrim decision without first reviewing copies of ppts. Applicant has been advised on August 8 and again on September 22 of the requirement to provide the copies. Required documents have not been received. Applicant has been advised that failure to provide the documents could result in the refusal of his application. No extension request was received by our office.
ECD: Please prepare ERR letter for non compliance and file back to CEB as soon as it has been completed. Letter to reflect today's date.
[18]
The Notes state that on 21 November 2011 the application was refused, and the Refusal Letter was mailed to the Applicant on 25 November 2011.
ISSUES
[19]
The Applicant raises the following issues in this application:
a. Whether the Applicant's right to procedural fairness was violated by the Respondent's failure to ensure the Applicant received the 22 September 2011 letter;
b. Whether the Officer ignored evidence when rendering the Decision.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[20]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis.
[21]
The opportunity to respond to a decision-maker's concerns is an issue of procedural fairness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Supreme Court of Canada held at paragraph 100 that "It is for the courts, not the Minister, to provide the legal answer to procedural fairness questions." Further, the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> held that the "procedural fairness element is reviewed as a question of law. No deference is due. The decision-maker has either complied with the content of the duty of fairness appropriate for the particular circumstances, or has breached this duty." The standard of review on the first issue is correctness.
[22]
The second issue goes to the Officer's use of the discretion awarded to him or her to award a permanent residence visa. The decision of a visa officer to grant a permanent residency is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Thus, the standard of review on the second issue is reasonableness.
[23]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47, and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
STATUTORY PROVISIONS
[24]
The following provisions of the Act are applicable in these proceedings:
Application before entering Canada

ARGUMENTS
The Applicant
Procedural Fairness
[25]
The Applicant says that whether or not the 22 September 2011 letter was never sent or got lost in the mail, he never received it. This being the case, his right to procedural fairness was violated because he was not given a meaningful opportunity to participate in the determination of his application.
[26]
The situation at hand is very similar to the one considered in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. That case dealt with an applicant who failed to attend an interview because she never received the notice for it. Justice John O'Keefe said at paragraph 28 that
...Given the applicant's responsiveness and genuine interest to immigrate to Canada, I am of the opinion that she did not simply receive the letter and fail to appear. In light of this finding, I also find that the applicant was not given sufficient notice of the interview. As a result, I believe that the applicant was not given a meaningful opportunity to participate in the process as required by even the low end of the procedural fairness spectrum. As there has been a breach of the duty of procedural fairness, the application for judicial review must be allowed and the matter is referred to a different officer for redetermination.
[27]
The permanent residence application in the present case was clearly very important to the Applicant. He had no knowledge that the High Commission wished him to send more documentation, and he did not receive the 22 September 2011 letter. Had the Applicant received the letter, he would have simply resent the documents.
[28]
The Applicant points to the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] as authority that the Applicant was not awarded procedural fairness. In that decision, Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer said at paragraphs 16-19:
Furthermore, when counsel was informed that the application had been rejected because the requested information had not been sent in time, she immediately contacted the visa office in Warsaw, more than once, to explain that neither she nor the applicant had ever received the e-mail in question.
In such a situation, the officer should have given the applicant the opportunity to provide the required documents in order to be able to assess her application on the merits.
This is a flagrant violation of the requirements of procedural fairness due to the fact that, as a result of this communication problem, the applicant did not have the opportunity to provide the officer with all of the evidence required to make an informed decision.
If the decision were to be upheld, the consequences of this communication problem would be extremely prejudicial to the applicant and her family who, after having waited several years, would have to file a new immigration application and who, moreover, would in all likelihood no longer qualify due to recent regulatory changes to the federal skilled worker program.
[29]
The Applicant submits that the 22 September 2011 letter was crucial to the determination of his application, and it should have been sent by registered mail, or the Officer should have followed up with the Applicant after not receiving a response from him. The High Commission had the Applicant's cell phone number and could have easily called him. The Applicant did not know he was required to submit more copies of the passports, and so had no opportunity to respond to the Officer's concerns. He submits that he was not afforded procedural fairness throughout the application process, and the Decision ought to be quashed and sent back for redetermination.
Reasonableness of the Decision
[30]
The history of this application demonstrates that the Applicant is dedicated to the immigration process. It is illogical to think that upon receipt of a request from the High Commission for something as simple as photocopies of his family's passports he would simply neglect to provide them.
[31]
The Officer did not consider the totality of the evidence before rendering the Decision. The Officer should have noticed the Applicant's diligence in pursuing his immigration matters, and should have acted accordingly. The Applicant states that
Canada (Director of Investigation and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  establishes that a decision is not reasonable if it cannot stand up to a somewhat probing examination, and the Decision in this case is unreasonable because it does not meet this threshold.
The Respondent
[32]
The Respondent asserts that the visa office had no indication that the 22 September 2011 letter failed to reach the Applicant, and the risk of non-delivery rests with him. Once it is proven that the communication was sent to the Applicant, the onus shifts to him. As stated by Justice Roger Hughes in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
The principle to be derived from these cases, all dealing with communications from the Embassy processing the application to the applicant or applicant's representative, is that the so-called "risk" involved in a failure of communication is to be borne by the Minister if it cannot be proved that the communication in question was sent by the Minister's officials. However, once the Minister proves that the communication was sent, the applicant bears the risk involved in a failure to receive the communication.
This principle has been recognized in other cases such as
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[33]
The Respondent submits that it has proven on a balance of probabilities that the 22 September 2011 letter was sent to the Applicant. It specifically points out that:
i. A copy of the letter is contained in the file;
ii. The address on the letter is identical to the address on the Refusal Letter, which the Applicant received;
iii. The Notes indicate that the Officer sent instructions to send the letter;
iv. The Notes make explicit reference to the letter being sent on 22 September 2011.
[34]
The evidence in this application is virtually identical to the evidence in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Yang
]. In that case, Justice Judith Snider said at paragraph 8:
Having reviewed the record before me, I am satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the March 27 letter was sent, by regular surface mail, to the address indicated by the Applicant. A copy of the letter is contained in the file; the address is correct; and, the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes make explicit reference to the sending of the March 27 letter. While the Applicant has produced evidence that his consultant did not receive the March 27 letter, he does not present evidence that would lead me to doubt that the letter was sent to the correct address by reliable means.
The Respondent submits that the
Yang
decision is authority that there was no breach of procedural fairness when the Officer did not ask the Applicant, for a third time, to supply the missing documents.
[35]
The Respondent submits that there was no obligation on the Officer to send the letter by registered mail or to obtain confirmation of its receipt. There is clear jurisprudence that the Officer was under no obligation to confirm or prove that the Applicant received the communication (see
Yang
at paragraph 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Applicant's reliance on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is ill-founded; in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> there was evidence that the letter in question was not sent ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 26-28), and in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> there was evidence that should have alerted the visa officer that the email was not sent ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 15). In the present case, there was no evidence before the Officer that might have led her to believe that the Applicant had not received the letter.
[36]
The Respondent points out that in the instructions given to the Applicant on 8 August 2011 he was told to submit complete copies of the passports, and he indicated that he understood. The Notes confirm that the Applicant understood the instructions. Thus, the Applicant was given two opportunities to submit the documents. Not only that, even after the application was refused the Applicant tried to send in the missing documents, but again he failed to submit photocopies of the entire passports as requested.
[37]
The Respondent also notes that in the Applicant's Memorandum he refers to email correspondence between himself and the High Commission that took place after his application was refused. The Respondent says that it is unclear why the individual in the email dated 16 January 2012 said that the High Commission never received the documents submitted by the Applicant in August 2011, when in fact it did. Nevertheless, it is clear from the Notes that the Officer did receive these documents and considered them before refusing the application.
[38]
The Federal Court has held that procedural fairness does not require Citizenship and Immigration Canada to confirm receipts of communications (see
Yang
at paragraph 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Applicant was given two opportunities to submit the required documentation, and he did not do so. The Respondent submits that the appropriate remedy in this case is to require the Applicant to re-apply by submitting the correct documentation.
ANALYSIS
[39]
The Applicant says that, on 22 August 2011, after receiving a call from an officer in New Delhi, he "sent the required documents via Blue Dart." This is not an accurate statement of what happened. The Notes show that on 8 August 2011, an officer telephoned the Applicant and advised him to provide a corrected Schedule-1 for his son with details regarding his previous student visa applications "and also to provide us with copies of all the pages of passports, (old and new) for entire family." The Notes also make clear that the Applicant "confirmed understanding and stated that he would provide us with the requested documents." There is no reason on the evidence before me to doubt the accuracy of the Notes.
[40]
The Applicant, however, did not provide complete copies of the passports for all family members. He only submitted the bio page and the family info page for his son and daughter. Notwithstanding the Applicant's failure to comply, a reminder letter dated 22 September 2011 was sent to him, although he says he did not receive it.
[41]
I agree with the Respondent that the evidence before this Court establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that the letter dated 22 September 2011, was properly sent. The High Commission had no indication that the communication failed. Accordingly, the risk of non-delivery rests with the Applicant.
[42]
As the Respondent points out, the jurisprudence is clear that once the Minister proves that a communication was sent to an applicant and the High Commission has no indication that the communication failed, the risk of non-delivery rests with the applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 12; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[43]
In this case, the Respondent has proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the letter dated 22 September 2011 was sent to the Applicant. This is because:
(a) A copy of the letter is contained in the file;
(b) The address on the letter is identical to the address on the decision letter, which the Applicant received;
(c) The Officer's affidavit confirms that the CAIPS Notes accurately reflect her assessment of the file, and the CAIPS Notes indicate that the Officer sent instructions to send the letter in question;
(d) The CAIPS Notes entered by a Program Assistant (CAIPS initials AM) on September 22 make explicit reference to the letter in question being sent on that date.
[44]
In
Yang
, above, Justice Snider found similar evidence to be sufficient to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that a letter was sent via regular mail.
[45]
Accordingly, the Applicant bears the risk involved in a failure to receive the communication. This means there was no breach of procedural fairness when the Officer did not ask the Applicant, for a third time, to supply the missing documents.
[46]
The Applicant argues that the Officer should have sent the letter at issue by registered mail or confirmed receipt of the letter before refusing the application. However, the jurisprudence establishes that the Minister is under no obligation to confirm or prove that the Applicant received a communication.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
Yang
, above, at paragraph 14.
[47]
In support of his argument that the Officer was required to confirm receipt of the letter dated 22 September 2011, the Applicant relies on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. However, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , there was evidence that the letter in question was not sent, and in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> there was evidence that should have alerted the officer that the e-mail in question had not been properly sent. In the present case, the Respondent has proven that the letter was properly sent, and there was no evidence before the Officer that might have led her to believe that the Applicant did not receive the letter. Accordingly, in my view, there was no obligation on the Minister to send the letter in question by registered mail or confirm receipt, as suggested by the Applicant.
[48]
In the present case, I have no reason to doubt the Applicant's evidence that he did not receive the 22 September 2011 letter. However, this does not end the matter. The governing jurisprudence tells us, in effect, that the risk of a failure of communication shifts to the Applicant if the Respondent is able to show that, on a balance of probabilities, the communication was sent and, secondly, that the Respondent had no reason to think that the communication had failed.
[49]
As Justice Robert Barnes made clear in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> In summary, when a communication is correctly sent by a visa officer to an address (e-mail or otherwise) that has been provided by an applicant which has not been revoked or revised and where there has been no indication received that the communication may have failed, the risk of non-delivery rests with the applicant and not with the respondent. In the result, this application must be dismissed.
[50]
Notwithstanding this clear position of the law, Applicant's counsel has asked the Court to consider the serious implications that dismissing this application will have for the Applicant. While the Court has a great deal of sympathy for the fact that a negative decision could mean that the Applicant might not be able to come to Canada, the Court clearly has no general discretion to disregard established precedent on this basis. Other applicants have also had to suffer serious consequences of negative decisions.
[51]
There are reasons for our present system and why the risk must fall on the Applicant. His counsel has made every effort to distinguish what happened in this case from the governing jurisprudence, and she has pressed upon the Court in a most able way the Applicant's position. In the end, however, the Court must apply the law as it stands.
[52]
For reasons already given, there was no obligation on the Respondent to send the communication in question by registered mail, or to check and ensure that the 22 September 2011 letter was received by the Applicant. Thus, there has been no breach of procedural fairness in this case. As the issue of whether the Officer ignored evidence is necessarily intertwined with the procedural fairness issue, I also find that the Decision was reasonable.
[53]
Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[54]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application is dismissed.
2. There is no question for certification.

[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), en vue de soumettre à un contrôle judiciaire la décision datée du 21 novembre 2011 (la décision) par laquelle une agente des visas (l'agente) du Haut-commissariat du Canada à New Delhi (Inde) a rejeté la demande de résidence permanente au Canada du demandeur à titre de membre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés.
LE CONTEXTE
[2]
Le demandeur, citoyen de l'Inde, a présenté une demande de résidence permanente à titre de membre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) au Haut-commissariat du Canada à New Delhi (Inde). Sa demande a été rejetée parce qu'il n'a pas fourni les documents que l'agente demandait.
[3]
Le demandeur a tout d'abord présenté sa demande au Haut-commissariat à New Delhi le 18 avril 2010. Cette demande a été rejetée à cause d'une erreur commise dans le calcul des points relatifs à sa capacité d'adaptation. Il a ensuite présenté une demande de contrôle judiciaire qui a amené le défendeur à lui soumettre une offre de règlement. Le demandeur a accepté cette offre le 10 avril 2011 et le dossier a été renvoyé au Haut-commissariat pour décision.
[4]
N'ayant eu aucune nouvelle, le demandeur a envoyé une lettre datée du 24 mai 2011 au Haut-commissariat pour s'enquérir de l'état de sa demande. Le 3 août 2011, un membre du personnel du Haut-commissariat a téléphoné au domicile du demandeur et a demandé à lui parler. Il était absent, mais son épouse a donné à cette personne son numéro de téléphone cellulaire.
[5]
Le 8 août 2011, un membre du personnel du Haut-commissariat est entré en contact avec le demandeur et lui a demandé de transmettre une copie complète des passeports de tous les membres de sa famille, ainsi qu'une copie de la lettre de rejet que son fils aîné avait reçue au sujet d'une demande de visa d'étudiant.
[6]
Le 22 août 2011, le demandeur a transmis les documents demandés au Haut-commissariat par l'entremise de Blue Dart (le mandataire de DHL en Inde). Ces documents ont fait l'objet d'un suivi, et ils ont été livrés le 23 août 2011. Le demandeur a produit une copie de la confirmation de livraison. Les copies des passeports que le demandeur avait fournies dans cet envoi étaient incomplètes; il n'avait transmis qu'une copie de la page biographique et de la dernière page de chacun des passeports de ses enfants.
[7]
Le défendeur dit avoir envoyé une lettre au demandeur le 22 septembre 2011 pour l'informer qu'il avait 30 jours pour fournir une copie complète de tous les passeports. Une copie de cette lettre figure à la page 41 du dossier certifié du tribunal; elle a été envoyée par courrier ordinaire, sans suivi ni confirmation de livraison. Le demandeur dit qu'il ne l'a jamais reçue et qu'il ignorait que les copies des passeports étaient incomplètes.
[8]
Le 16 novembre 2011, l'agente a examiné le dossier et a décidé que, sans les documents demandés, il était impossible de vérifier comme il faut les antécédents. La demande a été rejetée le 21 novembre 2011. Le 13 décembre suivant, le demandeur a reçu une lettre datée du 21 novembre 2011 indiquant que sa demande avait été rejetée parce qu'il n'avait pas fourni une copie des passeports complets (anciens et nouveaux) les concernant, lui et les membres de sa famille.
[9]
Ne comprenant pas ce qui s'était passé, le 13 décembre 2011 le demandeur a envoyé au Haut-commissariat une lettre indiquant qu'il n'avait jamais reçu la lettre du 22 septembre 2011. Il n'y a pas eu de réponse à cette lettre. Le 21 décembre 2011, le demandeur a envoyé une autre lettre au Haut-commissariat pour expliquer que son dossier d'immigration revêtait pour lui un intérêt considérable, qu'il avait présenté une première demande en 2010 et qu'il n'aurait tout simplement pas négligé de transmettre les documents demandés.
[10]
Le 13 janvier 2012, l'avocat du demandeur a reçu du Haut-commissariat un courriel disant qu'il lui était impossible de retrouver le colis que Blue Dart lui avait livré le 22 août 2011. Le 17 janvier 2012, l'avocat a répondu par courriel et a joint le rapport de situation concernant le colis de Blue Dart.
L'avocat du demandeur a informé le Haut-commissariat que, s'il le fallait, il transmettrait de nouveau tous les documents requis
. Il a également informé le Haut-commissariat que le temps était d'une importance capitale parce que son client n'avait qu'un délai de 60 jours à compter de la réception de la lettre de rejet pour déposer une demande de contrôle judiciaire.
[11]
Le 31 janvier 2012, l'avocat du demandeur a reçu du Haut-commissariat une réponse indiquant que son courriel avait été transmis à la section appropriée. L'avocat a répondu par courriel le même jour, demandant une fois de plus que l'on confirme la réception de la lettre du 22 septembre 2011.
[12]
Le 10 février 2012, le demandeur a déposé la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire. Le 15 février suivant, son avocat a reçu du Haut-commissariat un courriel disant que le dossier de son client était entre les mains d'un agent des visas et qu'il était à l'étude. Le 20 février 2012, l'avocat a reçu une copie d'une lettre indiquant que la demande de résidence permanente de son client avait été rejetée.
LA DÉCISION FAISANT L'OBJET DU PRÉSENT CONTRÔLE
[13]
La décision dont il est question en l'espèce se compose d'une lettre datée du 21 novembre 2011 (la lettre de rejet) et des notes au dossier de l'agente (les notes).
[14]
La lettre de rejet, qui figure à la page 156 du dossier du demandeur, indique qu'il a été demandé à ce dernier, le 8 août 2011, de produire des copies des passeports complets (anciens et nouveaux) les concernant, lui et les membres de sa famille. La lettre mentionne ensuite qu'un rappel lui a été envoyé le 22 septembre 2011, l'informant qu'il avait 30 jours pour fournir ces documents, sans quoi sa demande serait évaluée en fonction des informations que l'agente avait en main à ce moment-là. La lettre de rejet indique au demandeur que le Haut-commissariat n'a toujours pas reçu ces documents et que, de ce fait, il rejette sa demande parce qu'il n'a pas satisfait aux exigences du paragraphe 11(1) de la Loi et que l'agente n'est pas convaincue que le demandeur n'est pas interdit de territoire.
[15]
Dans ces notes, l'agente commence par passer en revue l'historique procédural de la demande. Selon l'inscription datée du 1er août 2011, le fils du demandeur, Angkon, avait déclaré ne pas avoir été l'objet d'un refus antérieurement, mais en fait on lui avait déjà refusé deux permis d'étudiant. Les notes indiquent qu'il faudrait entrer en contact avec le demandeur et dire que les documents relatifs à son fils n'ont pas été remplis comme il faut. Selon les notes du 8 août 2011, l'agente s'est entretenue avec le demandeur et lui a dit de fournir des copies complètes des passeports de la famille tout entière et le demandeur a confirmé qu'il les transmettrait. Les documents sont marqués comme ayant été reçus le 8 septembre 2011.
[16]
Les notes du 21 septembre 2011 mentionnent que les documents demandés n'ont pas été reçus et qu'il faudrait écrire une lettre pour demander au demandeur les renseignements additionnels. Les notes disent que la lettre a été rédigée et mise à la poste le 22 septembre 2011.
[17]
L'agente a écrit ce qui suit dans ses notes, le 15 novembre 2011:
[traduction] La

n'est pas réglée. Comme la demande comportait au départ de fausses informations au sujet du rejet du permis d'étudiant du fils, je ne suis pas disposée à prendre une décision

sans examiner avant les copies des passeports. Le demandeur a été informé le 8 août et une fois de plus le 22 septembre de l'obligation de fournir les copies. Nous n'avons pas reçu les documents requis. Le demandeur a été informé que ce fait pouvait entraîner le rejet de sa demande. Notre bureau n'a reçu aucune demande de prorogation.

D'après les notes, la demande a été rejetée le 21 novembre 2011 et la lettre de rejet a été envoyée par la poste au demandeur le 25 novembre 2011.
LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[19]
Le demandeur soulève les questions qui suivent en l'espèce:
a. si le fait que le défendeur ne s'est pas assuré que le demandeur avait reçu la lettre du 22 septembre 2011 a causé un manquement au droit à l'équité procédurale du demandeur;
b. si l'agente a fait abstraction d'éléments de preuve lorsqu'elle a rendu la décision.
LA NORME DE CONTRÔLE APPLICABLE
[20]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu qu'il n'est pas toujours nécessaire de procéder à une analyse relative à la norme de contrôle. Si la jurisprudence établit bien la norme de contrôle qui s'applique à une question particulière dont la cour de contrôle est saisie, cette dernière peut plutôt adopter cette norme-là. Ce n'est que dans les cas où cette recherche se révèle vaine que la cour peut procéder à un examen des quatre facteurs que comporte l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle.
[21]
La possibilité de répondre aux doutes d'un décideur est une question d'équité procédurale (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 12. Dans l'arrêt
Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu, au paragraphe 100, que: « [i]l appartient aux tribunaux judiciaires et non au ministre de donner une réponse juridique aux questions d'équité procédurale ». Par ailleurs, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> la Cour d'appel fédérale a statué que « [l]a question de l'équité procédurale est une question de droit. Aucune déférence n'est nécessaire. Soit le décideur a respecté l'obligation d'équité dans les circonstances propres à l'affaire, soit il a manqué à cette obligation. » La norme de contrôle qui s'applique à la première question est la décision correcte.
[22]
La seconde question a trait à l'usage que fait un agent du pouvoir discrétionnaire dont il dispose pour accorder un visa de résidence permanente. La décision que prend un agent des visas d'accorder la résidence permanente est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). C'est donc dire que la norme de contrôle qui s'applique à la seconde question est la décision raisonnable.
[23]
Lorsqu'on contrôle une décision en fonction de la norme de la décision raisonnable, l'analyse s'attache à « la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ». Voir les arrêts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Autrement dit, la Cour ne doit intervenir que si la décision est déraisonnable, en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas aux « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».
LES DISPOSITIONS LÉGISLATIVES APPLICABLES
[24]
Les dispositions suivantes de la Loi s'appliquent en l'espèce:
Visa et documents
11. (1) L'étranger doit, préalablement à son entrée au Canada, demander à l'agent les visas et autres documents requis par règlement. L'agent peut les délivrer sur preuve, à la suite d'un contrôle, que l'étranger n'est pas interdit de territoire et se conforme à la présente loi.
[...]
Obligation du demandeur
16. (1) L'auteur d'une demande au titre de la présente loi doit répondre véridiquement aux questions qui lui sont posées lors du contrôle, donner les renseignements et tous éléments de preuve pertinents et présenter les visas et documents requis.
[...]
Application before entering Canada
11. (1) A foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa or for any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document may be issued if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this Act.
[...]
Obligation - answer truthfully
16. (1) A person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must produce a visa and all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires.
[...]
LES ARGUMENTS INVOQUÉS
Le demandeur
L'équité procédurale
[25]
Le demandeur déclare que, peu importe que la lettre du 22 septembre 2011 n'ait jamais été envoyée ou qu'elle se soit perdue dans le courrier, il ne l'a jamais reçue. Cela étant, il y a eu manquement à son droit à l'équité procédurale car on ne lui a pas donné une possibilité valable de prendre part à la décision concernant sa demande.
[26]
La situation dont il est question en l'espèce ressemble fort à celle qui a été examinée dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Dans cette dernière, il était question d'une demanderesse qui ne s'était pas présentée à une entrevue parce qu'elle n'avait jamais reçu l'avis de convocation. Au paragraphe 28, le juge John O'Keefe a déclaré:
[...] Vu l'empressement de la demanderesse et son désir authentique d'immigrer au Canada, je suis d'avis qu'elle n'a pas tout simplement reçu la lettre et omis de se présenter. En conséquence, je suis également d'avis que la demanderesse n'a pas reçu un avis valable de l'entrevue. Je crois donc que la demanderesse n'a pas bénéficié d'une occasion véritable de participer au processus comme elle y avait droit, même au regard de l'extrémité inférieure du registre de l'équité procédurale. Puisqu'il y a eu manquement à l'obligation d'équité procédurale, la demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être accueillie, et l'affaire sera renvoyée à un autre agent pour nouvelle décision.
[27]
En l'espèce, la demande de résidence permanente était manifestement très importante pour le demandeur. Ce dernier ignorait que le Haut-commissariat souhaitait qu'il transmette d'autres documents, et il n'a pas reçu la lettre du 22 septembre 2011. S'il l'avait reçue, il aurait tout simplement renvoyé les documents.
[28]
Le demandeur invoque la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], à l'appui de l'argument selon lequel il a été privé de son droit à l'équité procédurale. Dans cette décision, la juge Danièle Tremblay-Lamer a déclaré, aux paragraphes 16 à 19:
De plus, lorsque l'avocate a été informée que la demande était rejetée parce que l'information demandée n'avait pas été envoyée dans les délais requis, elle a immédiatement communiqué avec le bureau des visas de Varsovie et ce, à plus d'une reprise, pour expliquer qu'elle et la demanderesse n'avaient jamais reçu le courrier électronique en question.
Dans une telle situation, l'agent aurait dû donner à cette dernière l'opportunité de présenter les documents exigés afin de pouvoir évaluer sa demande au mérite.
C'est là un accroc flagrant aux exigences de l'équité procédurale puisqu'en raison de ce problème de communication, la demanderesse n'a pas eu l'opportunité de présenter à l'agent l'ensemble de la preuve nécessaire à une prise de décision éclairée.
Si la décision était maintenue, les conséquences de ce problème de communication s'avèreraient extrêmement préjudiciables pour la demanderesse et sa famille qui, après plusieurs années d'attente, se verrait dans l'obligation de déposer une nouvelle demande d'immigration et qui, de surcroît, ne pourrait vraisemblablement plus se qualifier, en raison de changements réglementaires dernièrement apportés au programme fédéral des travailleurs qualifiés.
[29]
Le demandeur soutient que la lettre du 22 septembre 2011 était essentielle pour qu'une décision puisse être prise sur sa demande, et qu'il aurait fallu l'envoyer par courrier recommandé, ou alors que l'agente aurait dû faire un suivi auprès de lui après n'avoir pas reçu une réponse de sa part. Le Haut-commissariat connaissait le numéro de téléphone cellulaire du demandeur et aurait pu facilement l'appeler. Ce dernier ignorait qu'il était tenu de produire d'autres copies des passeports, et il n'a donc pas eu la possibilité de dissiper les doutes de l'agente. Il soutient qu'il a été privé de son droit à l'équité procédurale pendant toute la durée du processus de demande, et qu'il y aurait lieu d'annuler la décision et de la renvoyer en vue d'un nouvel examen.
Le caractère raisonnable de la décision
[30]
Il ressort de l'historique de la présente demande que le demandeur a à cœur le processus d'immigration. Il est illogique de penser qu'après avoir reçu du Haut-commissariat une demande concernant une chose aussi simple que des photocopies des passeports de sa famille il aurait simplement négligé de les fournir.
[31]
L'agente n'a pas tenu compte de la totalité des éléments de preuve avant de rendre la décision. Elle aurait dû constater la diligence avec laquelle le demandeur suivait son dossier d'immigration, et elle aurait dû agir en conséquence. Selon le demandeur, l'arrêt
Canada (Directeur des enquêtes et recherches) c Southam Inc.
, [1997] 1 RCS 748, établit qu'une décision n'est pas raisonnable si elle ne peut résister à un examen assez poussé, et, dans le cas présent, la décision est déraisonnable parce qu'elle ne satisfait pas à ce critère.
Le défendeur
[32]
Le défendeur soutient que l'agente des visas n'avait aucune indication que le demandeur n'avait pas reçu la lettre du 22 septembre 2011, et que c'est ce dernier qui supporte le risque de non-livraison. Une fois qu'il est prouvé que la communication a été envoyée au demandeur, c'est sur ses épaules que pèse ensuite le fardeau de la preuve. Comme l'a déclaré le juge Roger Hughes dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[traduction] Le principe qui se dégage de ces décisions, qui visent toutes des communications envoyées par l'ambassade traitant la demande au demandeur ou au représentant du demandeur, est que le prétendu « risque » présenté par le défaut d'envoi de la communication doit être assumé par le ministre s'il ne peut pas prouver que la communication en cause a été envoyée par ses représentants. Cependant, une fois que le ministre prouve que la communication a bien été envoyée, le demandeur assume le risque présenté par le défaut de réception de la communication.
Ce principe a été reconnu dans d'autres décisions, telles que
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[33]
Le défendeur soutient qu'il a prouvé, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la lettre du 22 septembre 2011 a été envoyée au demandeur. Il souligne plus précisément que:
i. une copie de la lettre figure dans le dossier;
ii. l'adresse indiquée sur la lettre est identique à celle qui apparaît sur la lettre de rejet, que le demandeur a reçue;
iii. les notes indiquent que l'agente a donné comme instruction qu'on envoie la lettre;
iv. les notes font explicitement référence au fait que la lettre a été envoyée le 22 septembre 2011.
[34]
Dans la présente demande, la preuve est quasi identique à celle qu'il y avait dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Yang
]. Dans cette dernière, la juge Judith Snider a écrit, au paragraphe 8:
Ayant examiné le dossier dont je dispose, je suis convaincue, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la lettre du 27 mars a été envoyée, par courrier ordinaire, à l'adresse donnée par le demandeur. Une copie de la lettre figure dans le dossier. L'adresse qui y est indiquée est correcte. Les notes du Système de traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration font explicitement mention de l'envoi de la lettre du 27 mars. Bien qu'il ait présenté des éléments de preuve selon lesquels son consultant n'avait pas reçu la lettre du 27 mars, le demandeur n'a pas présenté de preuve qui me permettrait de douter du fait que la lettre a été envoyée à la bonne adresse par des moyens fiables.
Selon le défendeur, la décision
Yang
étaye l'argument selon lequel il n'y a pas eu de manquement à l'équité procédurale quand l'agente n'a pas demandé au demandeur, pour une troisième fois, de fournir les documents qui manquaient.
[35]
Le défendeur fait valoir que l'agente n'était pas obligée d'envoyer la lettre par courrier recommandé ou d'obtenir une confirmation de sa réception. Il ressort clairement de la jurisprudence que l'agente n'était nullement tenue de confirmer ou de prouver que le demandeur avait reçu la communication (voir
Yang
, au paragraphe 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le demandeur se fonde à tort sur les décisions <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il y avait une preuve que la lettre en question n'avait pas été envoyée ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 26 à 28), et, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il y avait une preuve qui aurait dû attirer l'attention de l'agent des visas sur le fait que le courriel n'avait pas été envoyé ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 15). En l'espèce, l'agente n'avait en main aucune preuve qui aurait pu l'amener à croire que le demandeur n'avait pas reçu la lettre.
[36]
Le défendeur souligne que dans les instructions données au demandeur le 8 août 2011 il lui a été dit de transmettre des copies complètes des passeports, et le demandeur a indiqué qu'il comprenait. Les notes confirment que le demandeur a compris les instructions qu'on lui donnait. Il a donc eu deux chances de présenter les documents en question. Par surcroît, même après le rejet de la demande, le demandeur a tenté de transmettre les documents manquants, mais là encore il a omis de transmettre des photocopies des passeports entiers, comme on le lui avait demandé.
[37]
Le défendeur signale également que le demandeur, dans son mémoire, fait référence à un échange de courriels qu'il y a eu entre le Haut-commissariat et lui-même après le rejet de sa demande. Le défendeur déclare qu'il n'est pas clair pourquoi, dans le courriel daté du 16 janvier 2012, la personne a déclaré que le Haut-commissariat n'avait jamais reçu les documents présentés par le demandeur en août 2011, alors qu'en fait il les avait reçus. Néanmoins, il ressort clairement des notes que l'agente a bel et bien reçu ces documents et qu'elle les a pris en considération avant de rejeter la demande.
[38]
La Cour fédérale a statué que l'équité procédurale n'exige pas que Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada confirme la réception des communications (voir
Yang
, au paragraphe 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le demandeur a eu deux chances de produire les documents requis, et il ne l'a pas fait. Selon le défendeur, le redressement approprié dans le cas présent est d'exiger que le demandeur présente une nouvelle demande en produisant cette fois-ci les bons documents.
ANALYSE
[39]
Le demandeur dit que, le 22 août 2011, après avoir reçu un appel d'un agent en poste à New Delhi, il [traduction] « a envoyé les documents requis par l'intermédiaire de Blue Dart ». Ce n'est pas là une description exacte de ce qui s'est passé. Les notes indiquent que, le 8 août 2011, un agent a téléphoné au demandeur et lui a dit de fournir une annexe-1 rectifiée pour son fils, en y ajoutant des détails concernant les demandes de visa d'étudiant antérieures de ce dernier [traduction] « et de nous faire parvenir aussi des copies de toutes les pages des passeports (anciens et nouveaux) de la famille tout entière ». Les notes indiquent clairement aussi que le demandeur [traduction] « a confirmé qu'il comprenait et a dit qu'il nous fournirait les documents demandés ». Au vu de la preuve qui m'est soumise, il n'y a pas lieu de douter de l'exactitude des notes.
[40]
Cependant, le demandeur n'a pas fourni une copie complète des passeports de tous les membres de la famille. Il n'a produit que la page biographique et la page d'informations familiales qui se rapportaient à son fils et à sa fille. Même si le demandeur n'a pas obtempéré, une lettre de rappel, datée du 22 septembre 2011, lui a été envoyée, encore qu'il dise ne pas l'avoir reçue.
[41]
Je conviens avec le défendeur que la preuve soumise à la Cour établit, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la lettre datée du 22 septembre 2011 a été dûment envoyée. Le Haut-commissariat n'a eu aucune indication que la communication avait échoué. De ce fait, le risque de non-livraison pèse sur les épaules du demandeur.
[42]
Comme le défendeur le fait remarquer, la jurisprudence indique clairement qu'une fois que le ministre prouve qu'une communication a été envoyée à un demandeur et que le Haut-commissariat n'a aucune indication que la communication a échouée, le risque de non-livraison repose sur les épaules du demandeur.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[43]
En l'espèce, le défendeur a prouvé selon la prépondérance des probabilités que la lettre datée du 22 septembre 2011 a été envoyée au demandeur. En effet:
a) une copie de la lettre figure dans le dossier;
b) l'adresse indiquée sur la lettre est identique à celle qui figure dans la lettre de décision, que le demandeur a reçue;
c) l'affidavit de l'agente confirme que les notes du STIDI reflètent avec exactitude l'évaluation qu'elle a faite du dossier, et ces notes indiquent qu'elle a donné comme instruction qu'on envoie la lettre en question;
d) les notes qu'un adjoint aux programmes a inscrites dans le STIDI (initiales AM dans le STIDI) le 22 septembre font explicitement référence au fait que la lettre en question a été envoyée à cette date-là.
[44]
Dans la décision
Yang
, précitée, la juge Snider a estimé qu'une preuve similaire était suffisante pour conclure selon la prépondérance des probabilités qu'une lettre avait été envoyée par courrier ordinaire.
[45]
En conséquence, le demandeur supporte le risque que présente la non-réception de la communication. Cela veut dire qu'il n'y a pas eu de manquement à l'équité procédurale lorsque l'agente n'a pas demandé au demandeur, pour une troisième fois, de fournir les documents qui manquaient.
[46]
Le demandeur fait valoir que l'agente aurait dû envoyer la lettre en question par courrier recommandé ou confirmer la réception de la lettre avant de rejeter sa demande. Cependant, il ressort de la jurisprudence que le ministre n'est pas tenu de confirmer ou de prouver que le demandeur a reçu une communication.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; et
Yang
, précitée, au paragraphe 14.
[47]
À l'appui de son argument selon lequel l'agente était tenue de confirmer la réception de la lettre datée du 22 septembre 2011, le demandeur invoque les décisions <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée. Cependant, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il y avait une preuve que la lettre en question n'avait pas été envoyée, et dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> il y avait une preuve qui aurait dû attirer l'attention de l'agent sur le fait que le courriel en question n'avait pas été dûment envoyé. Dans le cas présent, le défendeur a prouvé que la lettre avait été bel et bien envoyée, et l'agente n'avait en main aucune preuve pouvant l'amener à croire que le demandeur n'avait pas reçu la lettre. De ce fait, selon moi, le ministre n'était pas tenu d'envoyer la lettre en question par courrier recommandé ou d'en confirmer la réception, comme le demandeur l'a laissé entendre.
[48]
En l'espèce, je n'ai aucune raison de mettre en doute la preuve du demandeur selon laquelle il n'a pas reçu la lettre du 22 septembre 2011. Toutefois, cela ne règle pas la question. La jurisprudence applicable nous dit, en fait, que le risque d'un défaut de communication repose sur les épaules du demandeur si le défendeur est en mesure de montrer que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, la communication a été envoyée et, deuxièmement, si le défendeur n'avait aucune raison de croire que la communication avait échoué.
[49]
Comme l'a indiqué clairement le juge Robert Barnes dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
En résumé, lorsqu'une lettre est envoyée correctement par un agent des visas à une adresse (électronique ou autre) fournie par un demandeur, que cette adresse n'ait pas fait l'objet d'une révocation ou d'une révision, et qu'on a reçu aucun indice de la possibilité que la communication ait échoué, le risque de défaut de livraison repose sur les épaules du demandeur, et non du défendeur. Par conséquent, la présente demande doit être rejetée.
[50]
Indépendamment de cette position claire du droit, l'avocate du demandeur a demandé à la Cour de prendre en considération les répercussions sérieuses qu'aura pour son client le rejet de la présente demande. La Cour est bien sensible au fait qu'une décision défavorable pourrait vouloir dire que le demandeur ne sera peut-être pas en mesure de venir au Canada, mais elle n'a clairement pas le pouvoir discrétionnaire général de faire abstraction de la jurisprudence établie pour ce motif. D'autres demandeurs ont eu à subir eux aussi les conséquences sérieuses d'une décision défavorable.
[51]
Il y a des motifs qui expliquent notre système actuel et pourquoi le risque doit reposer sur les épaules du demandeur. L'avocate de ce dernier a fait tout ce qu'elle pouvait pour faire une distinction entre ce qui s'est passé en l'espèce et la jurisprudence applicable, et elle a défendu devant la Cour, de manière très compétente, la position de son client. Au bout du compte, toutefois, la Cour est tenue d'appliquer le droit qui est en vigueur.
[52]
Pour les motifs déjà mentionnés, le défendeur n'était pas tenu d'envoyer la communication en question par courrier recommandé, ni de vérifier si le demandeur avait reçu la lettre du 22 septembre 2011. Il n'y a donc pas eu de manquement à l'équité procédurale dans le cas présent. La question de savoir si l'agente a fait abstraction d'éléments de preuve étant inextricablement liée à celle de l'équité procédurale, je conclus aussi que la décision est raisonnable.
[53]
Les avocats conviennent qu'il n'y a pas de question à certifier, et la Cour est du même avis.
JUGEMENT
[54]
LA COUR STATUE que:
1. La demande est rejetée.
2. Il n'y a pas de question à certifier.

 Summary: 
 
 The plaintiff was a band councillor elected according to custom. He was removed from office. Later, his nomination for Chief was not accepted. The plaintiff sued for damages, alleging, inter alia, that his removal from office was illegal because it was not done in accordance with the Indian Act, s. 78, and that his removal and the refusal to accept his nomination for Chief violated the Charter, ss. 3, and 7.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, dismissed the action.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Introduction  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] 
   
 Heald, D.J. 
 : This action was commenced by way of a Statement of Claim filed on November 20, 1990. The plaintiff is a member of the Blood Indian Tribe, and resides at Standoff, Alberta, on the Blood Tribe's Indian Reserve, near Lethbridge in Southern Alberta. The plaintiff is a former Band Councillor of the Blood Band. He brings this action against the present Chief of the Band, Roy Fox, and several other defendants who, excepting one, either have been Blood Band Councillors prior to November 28, 1990, or are now and have remained Councillors subsequent to that date. The one defendant referred to supra who is not and has not been a Band Councillor, is the defendant Martin Heavy Head. Heavy Head was appointed as an electoral officer under the Amended Blood Tribe Custom Election Bylaw for the purposes of an election to be held on November 28, 1990.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  In his prayer for relief, the plaintiff seeks "cumulatively or in the alternative" seven different declarations. Additionally, the plaintiff seeks damages in the sum of $120,200 arising out of the alleged violation of the  
 Indian Act, 
  R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, and pursuant to s. 24(1) of the  
 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
 . [See footnote 1]. By Third Party Notice filed on March 20, 1995, the defendants claim for indemnification as against Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs) for any liability they may incur in these proceedings.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Facts:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  By an order dated February 11, 1965 (the "Battle Order"), R.F. Battle, the Assistant Deputy Minister of Indian Affairs at the time, declared that pursuant to s. 73(1) (now s. 74(1)) of the  
 Indian Act 
 , R.S.C. 1951, c. 29, that on and after January 22, 1965, the council of the Blood Band, consisting of a chief and councillors, shall be selected by elections held in accordance with the provisions of the  
 Indian Act 
 . By an Order dated October 29, 1976 (the "Mackie Order"), effective November 22, 1976, P.C. Mackie, the Assistant Deputy Minister of Indian and Eskimo Affairs at that time, revoked the Battle Order referred to supra.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  As a result of the Mackie Order, the Band reverted to a custom system of selecting a chief and council. The first written Custom Bylaw was adopted by the duly elected Chief and Council of the Blood Band in 1976 and has been amended from time to time pursuant to the deliberations of the Band Council and an appointed Constitutional Committee. On August 30, 1984, the Amended Custom Election Bylaw (the "Custom Election Bylaw") was passed by the Blood Band Council.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  In November of 1988, the plaintiff was elected as a Councillor of the Blood Tribe in an election held pursuant to the provisions of the Custom Election Bylaw. His term of office was to be for a period of two years commencing in November of 1988, and ending in November of 1990. As part of his duties during this term, the plaintiff was to be Councillor in charge of the Public Works and Housing portfolio. During the 1988-1990 term, the Chief and Council received complaints concerning the plaintiff's administration of that portfolio. In response to requests from Band members and Band employees, the Chief and Councillors appointed an investigating committee who then engaged the Band's auditors, the chartered accountancy firm of Dawson Berezan and Partners, to conduct an audit with respect to the operations of the plaintiff's portfolio. It is the position of the defendants that the auditor's report confirmed the fact that the plaintiff was involved in a number of irregularities in the departments for which he was responsible.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The plaintiff attended a meeting of the Band Council on June 27, 1990, during which these allegations of irregularities were raised. The defendants assert that the plaintiff was given the opportunity at that meeting to respond to the findings of the investigation. In a letter dated June 29 
 , 1990, Chief Roy Fox asked the plaintiff to resign because of the allegations that he "had abused his office by acts of misconduct reflecting on the dignity and integrity of the Blood Band Council". The plaintiff denied the allegations and refused to resign. A special meeting of the Band Council was called for October 2, 1990, for the purpose of hearing answers to the "Statement of Grounds" filed pursuant to s. 11.01 of the Custom Election Bylaw. Section 11.01 sets out the procedure for removal of a Chief or Councillor from office. On that same date, the Band Council informed the plaintiff by letter that, in the meeting that day, they had declared him "guilty of misconduct reflecting on the dignity and integrity of the Blood Tribe Council" pursuant to the provisions of 9.01.04.04 of the Custom Election Bylaw and that he was, accordingly, removed from his office as Councillor. [See footnote 2].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  On or before October 30, 1990, the Band Council issued a notice of an election to be held on November 28, 1990. On November 6, 1990, a nomination meeting was held. At that meeting, an attempt was made to nominate the plaintiff for the office of Chief. The electoral officer (the defendant Heavy Head) was chairing the meeting and refused to accept the nomination because of provisions [see footnote 3] in the Custom Election Bylaw which disqualified from nomination anyone who had been removed as a Chief or Councillor pursuant to s. 9.01.04.04 supra. The election proceeded on November 28, 1990, without the plaintiff being a candidate. The defendants named in this action as "Representing themselves as the Band Council for a two year term after November 28, 1990", are those candidates who were successful in that election.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 3. What is the quantum of the damages suffered by the plaintiff arising from his removal from the office of Councillor and the refusal of the Band to accept his nomination for Chief?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Analysis:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Are The Blood Band's Election 
 
 Procedures Governed By The  
 Indian Act 
 
 Or By Band Custom?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  Section 74(1) of the  
 Indian Act 
  reads:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "74(1) Whenever he deems it advisable for the good government of a band, the Minister may declare by order that after a day to be named therein the council of the band, consisting of a chief and councillors, shall be selected by elections to be held in accordance with this Act. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [10] 
  Section 2 of the  
 Indian Act 
  defines "council of the band" as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "'council of the band' means  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) in the case of a band to which section 74 applies, the council established pursuant to that section,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) in the case of a band to which section 74 does not apply, the council chosen according to the custom of the band, or, where there is no council, the chief of the band chosen according to the custom of the band; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [11] 
  The cumulative effect of these two provisions is that if the Minister has made an order pursuant to s. 74(1), then the band council must be elected pursuant to the provisions of the  
 Indian Act 
 . If, however, there is no s. 74(1) order extant, then the band council must be chosen according to the band's custom.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 a) Is The Mackie Order Valid?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  In this case the Battle Order declared that on and after January 22, 1965, the band council shall be selected by elections held pursuant to the provisions of the  
 Indian Act 
 . However, as noted supra, the Mackie Order dated October 29, 1976, and effective November 22, 1976, revoked the Battle Order. Since the Battle Order was revoked by the Mackie Order, there was no order in effect under s. 74(1) of the  
 Indian Act 
  subsequent to November 22, 1976. Accordingly, thereafter, and pursuant to s. 2 of the  
 Indian Act 
  it followed that the Council was to be chosen according to the band's custom. In August of 1984, the Blood Tribe Council passed the Custom Election Bylaw which set out rules and procedures for the election of the band council. It was via an election held pursuant to the Custom Election Bylaw that the plaintiff was elected as a Councillor of the Blood Tribe Council.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  However, in his Statement of Claim, the plaintiff seeks a declaration that the Mackie Order supra, is ultra vires, illegal, void, invalid and of no force or effect. The defendants reply that the Mackie Order is a valid order since "inherent in the right to make an Order, is the right to rescind, modify or vary that Order" and that, accordingly, the Mackie Order was within the jurisdiction and powers of the Minister. [See footnote 4].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  I agree with that view of the matter. Support for that view is to be found in this court's decision in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  plaintiff asked for a declaration that the Cote Indian Band remained subject to an order declaring that the band council election should be held pursuant to the provisions of the  
 Indian Act 
 . That order had been amended by a second order deleting the Cote Band from the Schedule that listed the bands to which it applied. Thus, as in this case, it was necessary for the court to determine the validity of the second order. The plaintiff attacked the validity of the second order because it was issued not by the Minister but by the Deputy Minister. Strayer, J. (as he then was), concluded that, pursuant to the general provisions of the  
 Interpretation Act 
  and in the absence of any specific provision limiting the implied power of repeal, the Minister would have had the power to repeal his own regulation. [See footnote 6]. Strayer, J., further concluded that the power of the Minister to delegate to the Deputy Minister is "unlimited in scope." [See footnote 7]. Accordingly, I conclude that the  
 Badger 
  decision is conclusive on this issue and supports my view, supra, that the Mackie Order was within the jurisdiction and powers of the Deputy Minister and therefore the Band's election procedures are governed by band custom.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 b) Does The Custom Election Bylaw 
 
 Reflect The Band's Custom?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Having concluded supra that the Band's election procedures are governed by the Band's custom, it now becomes necessary to examine the evidence which defines that custom. On August 30, 1994, the Blood Tribe Council passed the Custom Election Bylaw. In his Fifth Amended Statement of Claim (para. 19), the plaintiff pleads the said Custom Election Bylaw is "bad in law, illegal, void, invalid and of no force or effect, as the Bylaw does not conform with the customs of the Blood Band." The answer to this plea is to be found in a paragraph in the preamble to the order of Rothstein, J., dated March 21, 1995. That paragraph reads as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "AND WHEREAS the plaintiff concedes that if the Blood Band's election procedures are governed by Band custom and not by the  
 Indian Act 
  that the Band custom is reflected in the bylaw of the Band relating to elections and that there will therefore be no evidence called or required into the issue of Band custom; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [16] 
  On this basis it seems evident that band custom was reflected in the Custom Election Bylaw and that the Band's election procedures must be governed by the Custom Election Bylaw passed by the Blood Tribe Council.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 c) Does S. 78 Of The Indian Act Apply 
 
 To Band Councils Selected In 
 
 Accordance With Band Custom?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  The plaintiff submitted that the tenure of and eligibility for office as Chief or Councillor of the Blood Band is governed by s. 78 of the  
 Indian Act 
 , and that, therefore the plaintiff was illegally removed from the office of Councillor. [See footnote 8]. The only case adduced by counsel in support of this submission, in my view, is the Federal Court decision in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  J., was of the view that s. 79 was applicable to an election held according to band custom, rather than under the  
 Indian Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  With all due respect, I am of the view that ss. 74-79 of the  
 Indian Act 
  are only applicable to band councils elected in accordance with the  
 Indian Act 
 , pursuant to a ministerial order under s. 74(1). Section 2 of the  
 Act 
  recognizes two types of band councils: a band council elected in accordance with the  
 Act 
 , and a band council chosen in accordance with band custom. Section 74(1) of the  
 Act 
  provides that whenever the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs "deems it advisable for the good government of a band, the Minister may declare by order that ... the council of the band, consisting of a chief and councillors,  
 shall be selected by elections to be held in accordance with this  
 Act 
 " (emphasis added). In my view, ss. 74-79 simply set out the election procedure to be followed by those bands that select their band council by an election held in accordance with the  
 Act 
 . Although s. 78 does not address an election procedure per se, it provides necessarily incidental procedures in relation to tenure, vacancy of office and disqualification from office.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  Conversely, those bands that are not subject to a s. 74 ministerial order may select their band council in accordance with their band's custom, unimpeded by the  
 Act 
 . Section 2 of the  
 Indian Act 
  recognizes that the council of the band may be "chosen" according to the custom of the band. In my view, use of the word "chosen" suggests that the manner by which the band council is selected does not necessarily require an election; for example, the Band Chief position may be hereditary. It is therefore illogical that ss. 74-79 of the  
 Act 
 , which refer to band council "election" procedures would be applicable to a band council selected otherwise than by an election. 		   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Accordingly, I reject the plaintiff's submission that the plaintiff was illegally removed from office of Band Councillor due to the defendants failing to comply with s. 78 of the  
 Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Did The Blood Band's Election 
 
 Procedures And/Or The Blood Band's 
 
 Removal Of The Plaintiff From Office And 
 
 Refusal To Accept The Plaintiff's 
 
 Nomination For Chief Violate 
 
 The  
 Charter 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 a) Does The Charter Apply To The 
 
 Band's Election Procedures?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  Having decided supra that the Blood Band's election procedures are governed by band custom and that its Custom Election Bylaw reflects that custom and allows the plaintiff's removal from office as well as the refusal to accept his nomination for Chief, the remaining issue is whether the  
 Charter  
 applies to the Band's Custom Election Bylaw. This is a complex matter which involves, inter alia, the application of s. 32 of the  
 Charter  
 as well as the interpretation and possible application of s. 25 of the  
 Charter 
 . However, given the conclusion that I have reached with respect to the infringement of the plaintiff's  
 Charter  
 rights in this case, it is unnecessary for me to reach a conclusion on this issue. Accordingly, for the purposes of the ensuing discussion, I have assumed, without deciding, that the  
 Charter  
 does apply to the Band's Custom Election Bylaw.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 b) Have The Plaintiff's S. 3, 7 Or 
 
 15 Charter Rights Been Infringed?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Section 3 
 :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  Section 3 of the  
 Charter 
  reads:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "3. Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of members of the House of Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for membership therein. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [23] 
  The plaintiff claims the defendants have infringed his s. 3  
 Charter 
  right, firstly by removing him from the office of Councillor and secondly by refusing to allow him to be a candidate in the November 28, 1990, election. This submission is without merit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  as is its purpose: it is limited to the elections of provincial and federal representatives". [See footnote 10]. The  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , decision makes it perfectly clear that a s. 3  
 Charter 
  right is only applicable with respect to a  
 federal 
  or a  
 provincial 
  election. Accordingly, I reject the plaintiff's claim that the defendants have infringed his s. 3  
 Charter 
  right.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Section 7 
 :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  Section 7 of the  
 Charter 
  reads:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [25] 
  The plaintiff's Fifth Amended Statement of Claim includes the following further particulars of the alleged violation of the plaintiff's s. 7  
 Charter 
  rights:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(a) Addison Crow was removed from the position and office of Councillor of the Blood Band without the principles of fundamental justice being adhered to, including:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (i) denial of the right to a fair hearing;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (ii) failure to provide to Addison Crow sufficient and adequate notice of the nature of the case against him;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (iii) denial of the right to a hearing before an impartial, objective and unbiased decision-maker; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (iv) failure to provide Addison Crow with the opportunity to make representation at the hearing; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(b) the refusal to allow Addison Crow to be nominated and run as a candidate in the November 28, 1990 Blood Tribe Election. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [26] 
  A determination of a  
 Charter 
  right infringement in relation to s. 7 requires a two part analysis. Firstly, the plaintiff must establish that his right to life, liberty or security of the person was deprived. Secondly, the court must be satisfied that the deprivation was contrary to the principles of fundamental justice. [See footnote 11].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  With respect to the first step of the analysis, on this record it is apparent that the plaintiff has not been deprived of his life or the security of his person. This leaves for consideration the question of the plaintiff's liberty.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  The acts of the defendants that the plaintiff submits infringed his s. 7  
 Charter 
  right, are the act of removing him from office of Councillor and the act of refusing to allow him to be nominated and run as a candidate in the November 28, 1990, election. These acts clearly do not constitute, nor on this record is there any evidence of, deprivation of the plaintiff's physical liberty.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  The plaintiff's counsel put forth caselaw to support a broader definition of liberty: a definition that goes beyond mere physical liberty. Firstly, the plaintiff relied upon the B.C. Court of Appeal decision in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  provisions and regulations of the  
 Medical Service Amendment Act 
 , S.B.C. 1985, c. 39, had the effect of depriving the appellants of "liberty" within the meaning of s. 7, and in a manner not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The said provisions excluded the appellants from the opportunity to practice their profession as physicians in open competition with all other doctors in B.C., and excluded the appellants from the opportunity to provide medical services to patients everywhere in the province. I agree with the B.C. Court of Appeal in that "liberty" within s. 7 is not necessarily confined to "mere freedom from bodily restraint" [see footnote 13], however the  
 Wilson 
  case is distinguishable from the case at bar. In  
 Wilson 
 , the legislative scheme at issue not only severely impaired the appellants' ability to work in their chosen occupation, but it also restricted their mobility rights, and it did so indefinitely. In my view, those facts render the  
 Wilson 
  decision clearly distinguishable from the case at bar.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  The second case relied upon by the plaintiff is the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench decision in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  provision of the  
 Worker's Compensation Act 
  violated the plaintiff's s. 7  
 Charter 
  right. However, as that decision was reversed by the Alberta Court of Appeal [see footnote 15], I shall not discuss it any further.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  The plaintiff in the case at bar was removed from an elected office, pursuant to the Band's Custom Election Bylaw. The plaintiff was also denied the opportunity to participate as a candidate in the next election. However, the plaintiff was not barred from participating in the election as an elector. Nor was the plaintiff prevented from pursuing his political ambitions in other political arenas. Therefore, I am of the view the plaintiff has failed to establish that the acts of the defendants have infringed upon his liberty as is protected by s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  It is not necessary to embark on the second step of the analysis to determine if the plaintiff's liberty was infringed in manner inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice, as I have concluded the plaintiff's liberty was not infringed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Section 15 
 :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  At trial plaintiff's counsel indicated that after considering the evidence that had been presented, the plaintiff was no longer pursuing the s. 15 argument. Accordingly, this issue is no longer before me.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 c) If So, Is The Infringement Justified 
 
 Pursuant To S. 1 Of The Charter 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  Since I have concluded that none of the plaintiff's  
 Charter 
  rights have been infringed, it is unnecessary to consider s. 1 of the  
 Charter 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 d) Is The Custom Election Bylaw 
 
 Inconsistent With The Charter?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  As the plaintiff has failed to establish that his  
 Charter 
  rights were infringed by the actions of the defendants, which actions were pursuant to the Custom Election Bylaw, I am equally satisfied that the provisions at issue in the Custom Election Bylaw are not inconsistent with the  
 Charter 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. What Is The Quantum Of The Damages 
 
 Suffered By The Plaintiff Arising From 
 
 His Removal From The Office Of 
 
 Councillor And The Refusal Of The Band 
 
 To Accept His Nomination For Chief?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  In view of my conclusions with respect to issues 1 and 2 supra, it necessarily follows that the plaintiff is not entitled to any compensation or damages.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Conclusion:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  For all the foregoing reasons, the within action is accordingly dismissed. The defendants and the third party are entitled to their costs against the plaintiff on a party and party basis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Action dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

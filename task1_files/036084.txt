Russell, J.
: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (Act) for judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated 23 July 2010 (Decision), which refused the Applicant's application to be deemed a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. With the assistance of a smuggler, he travelled from China under a false passport and arrived in Canada on 15 April 2007. He was interviewed at the port of entry (POE) by immigration authorities, who asked why he was seeking refugee protection. The Applicant said that, in China, he had filed a complaint against officers of the Public Security Bureau (PSB) who were continually extorting money from his family's fruit stand. In consequence, he was arrested, jailed for a day and then released. When the PSB began looking for him once again, he fled to Canada. He stated that he had no other problems with the police. The Applicant never said during this interview that he was being sought by the PSB for being a Christian and attending an unregistered house church.
[3]
In his Personal Information Form narrative (PIF) and in his testimony at the hearing the Applicant admitted that he had fabricated the story of extortion and that religious persecution was the real reason for his fleeing China. In fact, the Applicant had never been jailed for any reason. He explained that he did not claim religious persecution when he first arrived in Canada because the smuggler had told him that, if he did, he would be returned to China.
[4]
In his PIF, the Applicant alleged that he joined a 12-member unregistered Christian house church in Fujian Province in May 2006. A pastor came to the group's meetings on three or four occasions and, on one of these occasions, he was baptized. On 4 February 2007, during a group meeting, two lookouts spotted the PSB approaching and gave a warning. The Applicant escaped and went to a friend's home to hide. While there, he learned that three other church members had been arrested and that the PSB had evidence against him. His family was advised to report the Applicant's whereabouts to the authorities but, instead, they contacted a smuggler to assist the Applicant in leaving the country. The PSB searched for the Applicant at his family's home on seven or eight occasions, most recently at Christmastime in 2009. At no time did they leave a summons or an arrest warrant. Soon after arriving in Canada, the Applicant began to attend a Christian church in Toronto. He attends regular services as well as Bible studies.
[5]
The Applicant fears returning to China because he believes that the PSB is still looking for him, that they would be able to find him anywhere in the country and that he would not be able to practise his chosen form of Christianity without being persecuted or at risk.
[6]
The Applicant appeared before the RPD on 12 February 2010. The hearing was conducted by videoconference. The Applicant was represented by counsel and an interpreter was present. The RPD found that the Applicant's version of events was not credible and that, should he return to Fujian Province, he would not face a serious possibility of persecution for practising his chosen form of Christianity, nor would he face a risk to life or a risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. This is the Decision under review.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
The RPD Did Not Find the Applicant's Evidence to Be Credible
[7]
The RPD did not find satisfactory the Applicant's explanation for failing to mention to immigration authorities at the POE that he had been pursued by the PSB for participating in an underground Christian house church. First, the Applicant could not explain why the smuggler would believe that Canadian immigration authorities would frown upon illegal religious activity in China. Second, if the smuggler had warned the Applicant against making a religiously-based claim, the Applicant would be unlikely to describe Canada as a "democratic, peaceful, civilized country" that "would guard every citizen's rights not to be violated," which is what he wrote in his POE statement. Third, setting aside the fact that the Applicant's statement in his PIF that his aunt helped him locate a smuggler conflicted with his testimony at the hearing that his parents had that responsibility, the RPD also found it unlikely that the aunt and/or parents would arrange to send the Applicant to Canada if they were told by the smuggler that Canadian authorities would likely deport the Applicant if they found out that he had engaged in illegal religious activity in China. The RPD therefore found that the Applicant's explanation for initially concealing the true basis for his coming to Canada was not credible. Moreover, the RPD found that the Applicant's lack of legal counsel at the time was irrelevant since "[a] statement of alleged truth does not require the prior advice of counsel."
The Country Conditions Documentation Does Not Support the Applicant's Claim
[8]
The RPD acknowledged that, while it is not always necessary for an applicant to provide corroborating evidence, particularly where the lack of such evidence is reasonably explained, the Applicant nonetheless provided no statements, letters, affidavits, Chinese church membership records, arrest warrant or jail visit records to support his version of events. Coupled with the documentary evidence, the vast majority of which reports no incidents of persecution of members of small underground house churches in rural areas of Fujian Province, the Applicant's evidence was found insufficient to establish a credible factual basis for his claim. The RPD concluded that there was "no more than a mere possibility" that the Applicant would face persecution on the basis of his religion and that, on the balance of probabilities, he would not face section 97 risks or dangers.
The
Sur Place
Claim Is Not Well-Founded
[9]
The RPD accepted that the Applicant was currently a practising Christian. However, it found that, if he were return to China and choose to worship in an unregistered house church in Fujian Province, as he has stated he would, he could do so freely without any serious possibility of persecution "by way of arrest, detention, constraint, theological interference, or material impediment."
[10]
The RPD recognized that the treatment of Protestant Christians varies throughout China and between rural and urban areas, with the latter being more restrictive. However, even the Applicant's documentary evidence indicated that Fujian is among the provinces with the most liberal religious policies; some of its churches, Bible schools and missions have been allowed to operate "for years." The only reference to possible religious persecution in Fujian was contained in two letters from the president of the China Aid Association, neither of which provided specific examples of persecutory events in Fujian. The RPD found that, given that nearly all of the Applicant's documents came from Christian sources that track the persecution of Christians in China, and given that none of them indicated more than a mere possibility that regular members of underground Protestant churches in Fujian would be persecuted, the Applicant would not face a serious possibility of persecution due to his religion nor would he face any of the risks and dangers set out in section 97 of the Act if he were to return to China. Therefore, his claims pursuant to sections 96 and 97 were dismissed.
ISSUES
[11]
The Applicant raises the following issues:
i. Whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the Applicant's credibility; and
ii. Whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the
sur place
claim.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
[13]
The Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to the particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis.
[14]
Credibility assessment is within the RPD's area of expertise. It is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraphs 51 and 53.
[15]
The assessment of the evidence regarding the Applicant's
sur place
claim also is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[16]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 47; and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
ARGUMENTS
The Applicant
There Was No Evidence to Rebut the Presumption of Truth
[17]
The Applicant argues that the RPD acted unreasonably in finding that the inconsistencies of his PIF and testimony when compared to his POE statement were sufficient to rebut the presumption that an applicant's claims are true.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (FCA). The Applicant's explanation that the smuggler warned him not to tell immigration officials that he had been practising Christianity illegally in China was plausible. The Applicant was so warned immediately before disembarking from the airplane and did not have time to consider the wisdom of this advice nor to confirm its accuracy, as he did not have access to counsel during his POE interview. The Applicant's lack of experience and education, his understandable reluctance to trust any authority figure and the fact that he was in detention at the time coalesced in such a way that the smuggler's warning seemed credible to the Applicant. The RPD took none of this into account. Instead, it applied North American logic to the Applicant's behaviour.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The RPD also failed to bear in mind that the Applicant's explanation for withholding information from Canadian immigration authorities came within a month of the POE interview.
[18]
With the exception of the POE inconsistency, the RPD cited no other material inconsistencies in the Applicant's testimony.
The
Sur Place
Claim
[19]
The RPD found the Applicant to be a practising Christian here in Canada but concluded that, if he were to return to Fujian Province and practise Christianity in an unregistered house church, he could "do so freely without any serious possibility of persecution by way of arrest, detention, constraint, theological interference, or material impediment."
[20]
The Applicant challenges this finding on two grounds. First, the Patriotic Church in China offends his religious beliefs. Second, the country conditions documentation is mixed with respect to whether persons similarly situated to the Applicant can practise their religion in China. The RPD erred by engaging in a "selective review" of the documentation when, according to the jurisprudence, the Applicant should receive the benefit of the doubt. For example, the Reverend Ko, in his letter, stated that he has been to mainland China where Christians are being persecuted. Also, the president of the China Aid Society has said that the government is repressive toward Christians in Fujian Province. Moreover, the Federal Court, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> held that "there was ample evidence before the Board that religion is not practised freely within registered churches in China and that members of underground churches are persecuted." The Applicant submits that the RPD ignored persuasive evidence and case law.
The Respondent
The RPD's Credibility Findings Were Not Unreasonable
[21]
The Respondent, in enumerating the Applicant's credibility problems which were identified by the RPD, contends that the RPD justified its negative credibility findings with reasonable and transparent reasons that were grounded in the evidence as a whole. The burden was on the Applicant to adduce credible evidence that established on a balance of probabilities a serious possibility that he would be persecuted for his religious beliefs and practices if returned to his country of origin. Where the applicant provides no corroborating evidence but rather expects the tribunal to accept him at his word, the tribunal is entitled to acknowledge the absence of documents that it could reasonably have expected to be in evidence to corroborate a story.
[22]
Consistency and plausibility are important indicators of credibility in an applicant's story. See
Canada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (2d) 78 (FCA). The Applicant's PIF and oral testimony at the hearing represent a significant departure from the claim made during the Applicant's POE interview, at which time the Applicant was given multiple opportunities to state the truth but expressly denied any basis for his claim other than alleged extortion of money from the family fruit stand by public officials. It was also open to the RPD to reject as implausible the Applicant's explanation for making this false claim, given the difficulty in reconciling his alleged belief that Canadian authorities would disapprove of his illegal religious activity in China and his statement that Canada was a country that would guard everyone's rights. To overturn a decision based on a negative credibility finding, the Applicant would have to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the RPD committed a palpable and overriding error that affected the assessment of the facts. See
R v Gagnon
, 2006 SCC 17 at paragraph 20. This he did not do.
The Assessment of the Country Conditions Documentation Was Reasonable
[23]
The RPD carefully considered the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package as well as the documentary evidence provided by the Applicant. It found no reliable evidence that regular members of an underground house church have ever been arrested in Fujian or had their chosen form of worship impeded in any significant way. Even the Applicant's documents, sourced from Christian groups that track such persecution, provided no specific examples of persecution.
[24]
The RPD was not required to accept the Applicant's testimony at face value. The truth of such testimony can be rebutted where the documentary evidence fails to mention "what one would normally expect it to mention."  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (FCA) at paragraph 1. The Applicant cites as authority Federal Court jurisprudence wherein the RPD was found to have ignored persuasive documentary evidence. That is not the case here. The RPD's weighing of the evidence, even if in a manner that does not favour the applicant, in and of itself, provides no grounds for the Court's intervention where the RPD acted reasonably.
ANALYSIS
[25]
This case raises a multitude of a familiar issues related to the treatment of Christians in China. Scores of cases have come before the Court that have very similar narrative backgrounds and which use very similar arguments and evidence to attack the RPD's Decision.
[26]
In its basic features, the Applicant relies upon what has become an almost generic set of facts. He became a member of an underground Christian house church in Fujian Province. There were 12 members. A pastor came to the group's meetings on three or four occasions. On one occasion the Applicant was baptized. Everything went well for a time until, one day, during a group meeting, the lookouts spotted the PSB approaching and gave warning. The Applicant escaped and went into hiding. He learned that other members had been arrested and that the PSB was looking for him. They went to his family home on seven or eight occasions. They left no summons but the Applicant decided that he had to leave China and, with the assistance of his family, he made contact with a smuggler and came to Canada.
[27]
There is little by way of authenticating detail to distinguish the Applicant's basic narrative from many others that have come before the RPD, and then the Court for judicial review. When such cases come before me for review, I am usually referred by both sides to competing authorities that go either way on fact situations and evidence that are not that dissimilar. Fine distinctions are drawn and, in the end, a great deal seems to depend upon the way the RPD handled the evidentiary package before it.
[28]
In this kind of situation, and particularly when an applicant provides no corroborative evidence, I think the Court must take into account the difficulties faced by the RPD as it goes about its legitimate business of deciding who is a genuine refugee and who is not. The presumption of truth, so often relied upon when no corroborative evidence is produced, does not mean that the RPD is not entitled to probe and question a claimant's narrative through whatever legitimate means are available to it.
[29]
In the present case, while the Applicant's basic narrative is close to the generic sequence outlined above, there are two factors that produce some kind of variation. The first one is that, when he arrived in Canada by plane the Applicant never said at the Port of Entry that he was being sought by the PSB in China for being a member of a Christian underground church. Even though he was questioned closely about what he was afraid of, his initial story was that he had filed a complaint against officers of the PSB who were extorting money from his family's fruit stand and that the PSB were looking for him for this reason.
[30]
Also of significance is that, after he later changed his story to one of religious persecution, the Applicant provided no corroborative evidence whatsoever from any friend or family member, or anyone else, that would support any aspect of his personal narrative.
[31]
Therefore, the RPD was faced with someone who changed his story to one of religious persecution after he arrived in Canada and who produced no corroborative evidence that would support that story.
[32]
The Applicant has raised a wide range of what he regards as reviewable errors in the Decision but, as a starting point, I do not think it is unreasonable that, given these two basic problems, the RPD was suspicious of the Applicant and felt it was necessary to test and assess his credibility in some way.
Assessment of Credibility
[33]
The Applicant has put forward various arguments as to why the RPD was unreasonable in not finding his allegations of persecution for his religious practices to be credible. In the end, however, it is my view that the Applicant simply disagrees with the findings of the RPD and now puts forward various reasons as to why the Court should also disagree with the RPD. It is not the job of the Court to submit its opinion for that of the RPD on credibility issues.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[34]
Some of the arguments raised are addressed by the RPD in its Decision. For example, the RPD made it clear why a lack of counsel at the Port of Entry interview could not explain the false story which the Applicant alleges he told at that interview. It is possible to disagree with this conclusion but I cannot say that it falls outside the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> range.
[35]
The Applicant also says that the RPD "applied a North American perspective of what was plausible in the circumstances rather than examine plausibility from the standpoint of the Applicant and the snakehead." The Applicant does not say how his perspective regarding plausibility differs from that of the RPD. What he appears to mean is that the RPD did not adopt his perspective because they did not believe him, and he does not agree with their reasons. The RPD obviously considered the Applicant's perspective because it refers to his explanation. I do not think that this is really a perspective issue. The RPD gave its reasons and, once again, I cannot say that they fall outside the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> range.
[36]
Without going through them all in detail, I think it is fair to say that each point raised by the Applicant regarding the credibility finding has some merit. In fact, it is my view that it would not have been unreasonable for the RPD to have accepted the Applicant's explanation and to have made a positive determination. However, what I cannot say is that, given the fundamental change in the primary basis for the Applicant's persecution narrative, and given both the total lack of any corroborative evidence concerning the Applicant's narrative and the objective country documents, the RPD's assessment of credibility falls outside of the range of possible acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law. It is possible to disagree with this Decision on the credibility findings but, in my view, if the Court were now to intervene it would, in effect, be assessing the evidence itself and substituting its own opinion for that of the RPD, which the Court cannot do.
[37]
The RPD's credibility finding is based in part upon the RPD's assessment of the objective evidence and its conclusion that, although Christians may be persecuted in other parts of China, that evidence does not support the proposition that the Applicant would face persecution or section 97 risk in Fujian if he were to practise his chosen form of Christianity. This finding also overlaps with the RPD's assessment of the same evidence when dealing with the Applicant's
sur place
claim.
Sur Place
Claim
[38]
Applicant's counsel's submissions to the RPD on the objective documentary evidence raises controversial and frequently debated issues. The Applicant complains that the RPD ignored his arguments and some of the issues raised and failed to deal with them in the Decision. My review of the submissions and the Decision leads me to the conclusion that perhaps the RPD did not address the submissions in the way that the Applicant thinks they should have been addressed but that, nevertheless, the essential ground is covered.
[39]
In fact, I believe that the RPD in this case took particular care to assess the available evidence and arrive at its conclusions. Its basic position is that the situation for Christians is bad in many parts of China, but there are significant differences among provinces and between urban and rural communities. As has been found before, the RPD concludes that Fujian is relatively liberal and that there is no evidence that would support a finding that the Applicant will face "a serious possibility of persecution for practicing his chosen form of Christianity in Fujian province if he returns there":
23. I considered the [Applicant's] documentary evidence to see if it contained evidence that conflicted with the evidence found in the National Documentary Package. I found no reliable document that indicates that regular members of a house church have ever been arrested or detained in Fujian or otherwise had their chosen form of worship impeded in any significant way. I did not find any documents which stated that Christian ministers had ever been arrested, convicted or tortured in Fujian. The exception to this lack of reference to Fujian in the [Applicant's] documents were two letters from the President of the Chinese Aid Association which is based in Texas and Washington DC. In these letters, the writer states that "religious repression continues to occur in every province in China, including Guangdong and Fujian province." He adds that "repression of unauthorized religious activity is a nationwide campaign mandated by the Chinese Communist Party". However, the writer provides no specific examples whatever of any particular persecutory events ever happening in those two provinces. It is an assertion without further evidence. Moreover, his inference (and those of some of the Christian sources referenced in Exhibit 6) that the repression in practice is mandated nationwide, from the top down, is at odds with the other specific documentary evidence referred to above that there is a wide geographic range of actual religious oppression in China, with Fujian and Guangdong being seen as tolerant.
24. This lack of mention in the [Applicant's] documents of repression in Fujian is significant. Nearly all of the [Applicant's] documents come from Christian sources which track the repression of Christians in China. These sources point out incidents of Christians being arrested, incarcerated, sent to re-education through labour camps and tortured by the Chinese authorities for practicing unauthorized forms of Christianity. The [Applicant's] documentary evidence comes from such sources as Epoch Times, Pilgrims Covenant Church, Mennonite Brethren Herald, BosNews Life Asia Service, Radio Free China, Voice of the Martyrs in addition to WorldNetDaily, Human Rights without Frontiers and the US State Department.
25. The [Applicant's] documentary evidence corroborates the documentary evidence found in the National Documentary Package that, if one is merely a regular church member of an underground Protestant House Church in Fujian, there is less than a mere possibility that such a member would face a serious possibility of persecution. If the [Applicant] had resided in other Chinese provinces, such as Shangdong, Xinjiang, Sichnan Hubei, Yunnan, Henan, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Beijing or Anhui, a different finding may have been reached. In those provinces, the [Applicant] has found documentary evidence indicating that ordinary Christians and their leaders have suffered for practicing Christianity in the way they wish to practice it. Fujian is not mentioned. I find that, in particular, given the advocacy orientation of many of the Christian documentary sources of the [Applicant], that, if there were instances of the religious persecution of unregistered Christian churches in Fujian, such sources would likely have mentioned them.
26. I note as well that the China Aid Association itself stated that, in 2007, "house churches were persecuted across 18 provinces." There are 22 provinces in China which indicates that, based on at least information available to that Association; one can conclude that there were provinces in China without such persecution.
[40]
Once again, I can find nothing deficient or unreasonable about the way in which the RPD assessed and weighed the available country condition documents in this case or its conclusions based on those documents.
[41]
The Applicant places strong reliance upon what Reverend Ko says about the persecution of Christians in China, but the RPD reasonably explains why such evidence cannot be used to support the proposition that there is a serious possibility that the Applicant will be persecuted if he is returned to Fujian. Conditions differ across China, and Fujian, along with Guangdong, is the most liberal of China's provinces.
[42]
The Applicant draws the Court's attention particularly to the report on the destruction of house churches in Fujian that is mentioned at page 92 of the CTR. This occurs in the 22 June 2007 Response to Information Request that appears in the National Documentation Package:
According to CAA, while the number of reported raids on house churches in China declined in 2006, there was an increase in the number of house church demolitions and forcible closures compared with the previous year (Jan. 2007, 19). In the province of Zhejiang, three house churches were apparently demolished during the year (ibid.; see also AFP 23 Dec. 2006; ibid. 4 Aug. 2006;
The Washington Post
1 Oct. 2006). There were also reports of house churches being destroyed in the provinces of Jilin and Fujian (CAA Jan. 2007, 19). Forcible closures of house churches were reported in Anhui province (ibid.; AsiaNews 12 Dec. 2006), as well as in Guangdong province, Shandong province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shanghai (CAA Jan. 2007, 19).
[43]
This is the only specific reference to possible persecution in Fujian to which the Applicant can point. In my view, this one specific reference to house churches in Fujian cannot be said to render the RPD's overall assessment of the evidence unreasonable when the preponderance of the evidence before the RPD is taken into account.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Yu
].
[44]
The Applicant is right to bring to the Court's attention the treatment of the same piece of evidence by Justice Michel Shore in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
The destruction of house churches in the Fujian province is evidence, in and of itself, that the Chinese authorities do not allow Christians to practice their faith freely. Freedom of religion encompasses the ability to espouse one's faith publicly, in a manner, individually or collectively, chosen in as much as not to interfere with the fundamental rights of others. By destroying house churches, the Chinese government is infringing on that right in a persecutory manner.
...
The Board found that the evidence did not support that the Applicant has good grounds for fearing persecution in an unregistered house church. In making this finding, the Board reviews the documentary evidence on the Fujian and focuses particularly on reports of arrests of unregistered Christians in the Fujian and finds that there are no reports of arrests of unregistered Christians in the Fujian. The Board also focused on the size of the Applicant's church, twenty - thirty members, and found that a church of that size did not need to register.
While there may not have been any reports of Christians being arrested in the Fujian, reports of persecution of house churches in the Fujian do exist: the destruction of house churches in that province have been reported. The China Aid Association considered a reliable, reputable source by the Board, itself, has had it reported as such. (page 106 at paragraph 3 of the Tribunal (Board) Record.)
The destruction of house churches in the Fujian is evidence, in and of itself, that the Chinese authorities do not allow Christians to practice their faith freely. Freedom of religion encompasses the ability to espouse one's faith publicly, in a manner, individually or collectively, chosen in as much as not to interfere with the fundamental rights of others. By destroying house churches, the Chinese government is infringing on that right in a persecutory manner.
Given the evidence of the destruction of houses of worship in the Fujian province, the Applicant does have substantial grounds to fear persecution if she chooses to freely exercise her right to freely practice her religion.
[45]
In my view, there can be no arguing with Justice Shore's conclusion that the destruction of house churches, in and of itself, may well constitute evidence that the Chinese authorities are interfering with fundamental religious rights in Fujian in a persecutory manner.
[46]
However, each case depends upon its facts and the way in which the RPD assesses the evidence. In the present case, the reference to reports of house church destruction in Fujian in 2007 has to be looked at in the context of all the other evidence before the RPD concerning Fujian in order to decide whether the RPD's overall conclusions about what the Applicant would be likely to face in Fujian are reasonable. The RPD does not just look at arrests and detentions; it also looks to see if Christians in Fujian have "otherwise had their chosen form of worship impeded in any significant way." Other cases in this Court have upheld RPD decisions involving the alleged persecution of Christians in Fujian. See, for example,
Yu
, above;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[47]
The reliance upon general statements and findings made by the Court in cases such as
Song
, above, and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  are equally misplaced in a situation where the evidence did not suggest the Applicant faced a serious possibility of persecution in Fujian. Just because the Court may have found in one case that the situation for Christians in Fujian may not have been adequately assessed and therefore returned the matter for reconsideration does not mean that the RPD commits a reviewable error in this case when it assesses the situation in Fujian against the Applicant.
[48]
The RPD's review of country conditions was not "selective" as alleged by the Applicant. The Decision reveals a thorough and thoughtful review of the available evidence and conclusions that have an objective evidentiary basis.
[49]
In the end, I agree that is possible to take strong issue with the RPD's findings on the
sur place
claim and that a finding in favour of the Applicant would not have been unreasonable, but the analysis is thorough and I cannot say that the RPD's conclusions fall outside of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> range in this case. Were the Court to intervene, it would simply be assessing the evidence itself and substituting its own opinion concerning the situation in Fujian for that of the RPD.
[50]
Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[51]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application is dismissed.
2. There is no question for certification.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, L.C. 2001, ch. 27 (la Loi), relativement à la décision rendue en date du 23 juillet 2010 par la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié de rejeter la demande présentée par le demandeur afin que la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ou de personne à protéger au sens des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi lui soit reconnue (la décision).
LE CONTEXTE
[2]
Le demandeur est un citoyen de la République populaire de Chine. Avec l'aide d'un passeur, il a fait le voyage de la Chine au Canada avec un faux passeport. À son arrivée au Canada le 15 avril 2007, il a été interrogé au point d'entrée (le PDE). Les autorités de l'Immigration lui ont alors demandé s'il demandait l'asile. Le demandeur a dit qu'il avait porté plainte en Chine contre des agents du Bureau de la sécurité publique (BSP) qui extorquaient continuellement de l'argent à l'étal de fruits de sa famille. En conséquence, il avait été arrêté, emprisonné pendant une journée puis libéré. Lorsque le BSP s'est lancé à nouveau à sa recherche, il s'est enfui au Canada. Il a affirmé qu'il n'avait pas eu d'autres démêlés avec la police. Il n'a jamais dit pendant l'entrevue avec les autorités de l'Immigration qu'il était recherché par le BSP parce qu'il était chrétien et qu'il fréquentait une maison-église non enregistrée.
[3]
Dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (le FRP) et dans son témoignage à l'audience, le demandeur a reconnu qu'il avait inventé l'histoire de l'extorsion et que la persécution religieuse était la véritable raison pour laquelle il avait quitté la Chine. En fait, le demandeur n'a jamais été emprisonné. Il a expliqué qu'il n'avait pas invoqué la persécution religieuse en arrivant au Canada parce que le passeur lui avait dit qu'il serait renvoyé en Chine s'il le faisait.
[4]
Le demandeur a écrit dans son FRP qu'il s'est joint à une maison-église chrétienne comptant 12 membres dans la province du Fujian en mai 2006. Un pasteur a participé à trois ou quatre rencontres du groupe. Le demandeur a été baptisé à l'une de ces occasions. Le 4 février 2007, deux personnes qui faisaient le guet pendant une rencontre du groupe ont aperçu des agents du BSP approcher et ont donné l'alerte. Le demandeur a pris la fuite et s'est caché chez un ami. Il a ensuite appris que trois autres membres de l'église avaient été arrêtés et que le BSP détenait des preuves contre lui. Alors qu'elle avait été avisée par les autorités de leur révéler où le demandeur se trouvait, sa famille a plutôt communiqué avec un passeur afin que celui-ci aide le demandeur à quitter la Chine. Des agents du BSP à la recherche du demandeur se sont rendus chez sa famille à sept ou huit reprises, la dernière fois pendant la période des Fêtes en 2009. Ils n'ont jamais laissé une assignation ou un mandat d'arrêt. Peu de temps après son arrivée au Canada, le demandeur a commencé à fréquenter une église chrétienne à Toronto. Il participe aux offices réguliers et à des séances d'étude de la Bible.
[5]
Le demandeur craint de retourner en Chine parce qu'il croit que le BSP est toujours à sa recherche, que celui-ci serait en mesure de le retrouver n'importe où dans le pays et qu'il ne pourrait pas pratiquer la forme de christianisme qu'il a choisie sans subir ou risquer de subir de la persécution.
[6]
Le demandeur a comparu devant la SPR le 12 février 2010. L'audience s'est déroulée par vidéoconférence. Le demandeur était représenté par un conseil et un interprète était présent. La SPR a estimé que la version des faits du demandeur n'était pas crédible et que, s'il devait retourner dans la province du Fujian, il n'existait pas une possibilité sérieuse qu'il soit persécuté parce qu'il pratique la forme de christianisme qu'il a choisie et il ne serait pas exposé à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de torture ou de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités. C'est cette décision qui fait l'objet du présent contrôle.
LA DÉCISION FAISANT L'OBJET DU PRÉSENT CONTRÔLE
La SPR n'a pas jugé crédible le témoignage du demandeur
[7]
La SPR n'a pas jugé satisfaisantes les raisons données par le demandeur pour expliquer pourquoi il n'avait pas dit aux autorités de l'Immigration au PDE que le BSP était à sa recherche parce qu'il avait participé aux activités d'une maison-église chrétienne clandestine. En premier lieu, le demandeur ne pouvait pas expliquer pourquoi le passeur croyait que les autorités de l'Immigration du Canada verraient d'un mauvais œil les activités religieuses qu'il avait menées illégalement en Chine. En deuxième lieu, si le passeur lui avait déconseillé de fonder sa demande sur des motifs religieux, il peu probable que le demandeur aurait décrit le Canada comme un [traduction] « pays démocratique, pacifique et civilisé » qui [traduction] « veille à ce que les droits de tous les citoyens soient respectés », comme il l'a écrit dans son FRP. En troisième lieu, écartant le fait que le demandeur avait écrit dans son FRP que sa tante l'avait aidé à trouver un passeur alors qu'il avait dit dans son témoignage à l'audience que c'était ses parents qui l'avaient fait, la SPR a conclu qu'il était peu probable également que la tante ou les parents aient pris des dispositions pour envoyer le demandeur au Canada si le passeur leur avait dit que les autorités canadiennes l'expulseraient probablement si elles découvraient qu'il avait participé à des activités religieuses illégales en Chine. La SPR a donc conclu que les explications données par le demandeur au sujet du fait qu'il avait d'abord caché la véritable raison de sa venue au Canada n'étaient pas crédibles. Elle a conclu également que l'absence d'un conseiller juridique à l'époque était sans importance étant donné qu'« [i] l n'est pas nécessaire d'obtenir l'avis d'un conseil avant de faire une déclaration concernant la prétendue vérité ».
La documentation sur les conditions existant en Chine n'étaye pas la demande du demandeur
[8]
La SPR a reconnu qu'il n'est pas toujours nécessaire qu'un demandeur produise une preuve corroborante, en particulier lorsqu'il fournit des raisons valables pour expliquer l'absence d'une telle preuve. En l'espèce cependant, le demandeur n'a fourni aucun affidavit, déclaration, lettre, liste de membres de l'église en Chine, mandat d'arrêt ou registre des visites de prison à l'appui de sa version des faits. Combiné avec les documents produits en preuve, dont la grande majorité ne font état d'aucun incident de persécution touchant des membres de petites maisons-églises clandestines dans les régions rurales de la province du Fujian, le témoignage du demandeur n'a pas établi un fondement factuel crédible pour sa demande. La SPR a conclu qu'il existait « moins qu'une simple possibilité » que le demandeur soit persécuté en raison de sa religion et que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, il ne serait pas exposé à l'un des risques mentionnés à l'article 97.
La demande présentée sur place n'est pas fondée
[9]
La SPR a convenu que le demandeur était un chrétien pratiquant. Elle a toutefois conclu que, s'il retournait en Chine et décidait de fréquenter une maison-église non enregistrée dans la province du Fujian, comme il le prévoit, il pourrait le faire librement sans qu'il existe une possibilité sérieuse de persécution« sous forme d'arrestation, de détention, de contraintes, d'interférence théologique ou d'obstacle important ».
[10]
La SPR a reconnu que le traitement des chrétiens protestants varie d'une région à l'autre en Chine, ainsi qu'entre les régions rurales et les régions urbaines - c'est dans les régions urbaines que ces chrétiens sont traités le plus sévèrement. Toutefois, même la preuve documentaire du demandeur indiquait que le Fujian est l'une des provinces où les politiques sont les plus libérales en matière religieuse; certaines de ses églises, de ses écoles bibliques et de ses missions exercent leurs activités « depuis des années » avec la permission des autorités. Il n'est question d'une possible persécution religieuse dans la province du Fujian que dans deux lettres du président de l'Association d'aide à la Chine; ces lettres ne contiennent toutefois pas d'exemples précis de persécution dans cette province. La SPR a conclu que, étant donné que presque tous les documents produits par le demandeur émanaient de sources chrétiennes qui font le suivi de la persécution de chrétiens en Chine et qu'aucun de ces documents n'indiquait qu'il existait plus qu'une simple possibilité que les membres réguliers des églises protestantes clandestines dans le Fujian soient persécutés, le demandeur ne serait pas exposé à une possibilité sérieuse d'être persécuté en raison de sa religion, ni à l'un des risques mentionnés à l'article 97 de la Loi, s'il retournait en Chine. En conséquence, elle a rejeté ses demandes fondées sur les articles 96 et 97.
LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[11]
Le demandeur soulève les questions suivantes:
i. La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son appréciation de la crédibilité du demandeur?
ii. La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son appréciation de la demande présentée sur place?
LES DISPOSITIONS LÉGISLATIVES

LA NORME DE CONTRÔLE
[13]
La Cour suprême du Canada a statué dans  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  qu'il n'est pas nécessaire de procéder à une analyse relative à la norme de contrôle dans tous les cas. En fait, lorsque la norme de contrôle qui s'applique à la question en litige est bien établie par la jurisprudence, la cour de révision peut l'adopter. Ce n'est que lorsque cette recherche se révèle vaine que la cour de révision doit examiner les quatre éléments de l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle.
[14]
L'appréciation de la crédibilité relève de l'expertise de la SPR. C'est la norme de contrôle de la raisonnabilité qui s'applique à cette question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, aux paragraphes 51 et 53.
[15]
L'appréciation de la preuve relative à la demande présentée sur place par le demandeur est également assujettie à la norme de contrôle de la raisonnabilité.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[16]
Lorsque la norme de la raisonnabilité s'applique, l'analyse portera sur « la justification de la décision, [...] la transparence et [...] l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi [que sur] l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ». Voir Dunsmuir, précité, au paragraphe 47, et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . En d'autres termes, la Cour devrait intervenir seulement si la décision n'est pas raisonnable en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».
LES PRÉTENTIONS DES PARTIES
Le demandeur
La présomption de véracité n'a pas été réfutée
[17]
Le demandeur soutient que la SPR a agi de manière déraisonnable en concluant que les contradictions entre son FRP et son témoignage, d'une part, et ses déclarations au point d'entrée, d'autre part, étaient suffisantes pour réfuter la présomption de véracité de ses prétentions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (C.A.F.). Les explications du demandeur selon lesquelles le passeur lui avait déconseillé de dire aux agents d'immigration qu'il pratiquait le christianisme illégalement en Chine étaient vraisemblables. Comme le passeur lui avait fait ce commentaire au moment de débarquer de l'avion, le demandeur n'avait pas eu le temps d'en évaluer la justesse ni de confirmer son exactitude car il n'avait pas eu accès à un conseil lors de son entrevue au PDE. Compte tenu de son manque d'expérience et d'instruction, de sa réticence - qui était compréhensible - à faire confiance à un symbole d'autorité quel qu'il soit et du fait qu'il était détenu à ce moment-là, le demandeur a cru le passeur. Or, la SPR n'a tenu compte d'aucun de ces éléments. Elle a plutôt appliqué une logique nord-américaine à la conduite du demandeur.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . La SPR a aussi omis de tenir compte du fait que le demandeur avait expliqué dans le mois qui avait suivi son entrevue au PDE pourquoi il n'avait pas révélé certains renseignements aux autorités de l'Immigration du Canada.
[18]
La SPR n'a relevé aucune autre incohérence importante dans le témoignage du demandeur.
La demande sur place
[19]
La SPR a constaté que le demandeur était un chrétien pratiquant au Canada, mais elle a conclu que, s'il retournait dans la province du Fujian et fréquentait une maison-église chrétienne non enregistrée, il pourrait « le faire librement sans qu'il y ait de possibilité sérieuse d'être persécuté sous forme d'arrestation, de détention, de contraintes, d'interférence théologique ou d'obstacle important ».
[20]
Le demandeur conteste cette conclusion pour deux raisons. Premièrement, l'église patriotique en Chine heurte ses croyances religieuses. Deuxièmement, la documentation sur les conditions existant en Chine est nuancée quant à la question de savoir si des personnes se trouvant dans la même situation que le demandeur peuvent pratiquer leur religion en Chine. La SPR a commis une erreur en procédant à un [traduction] « examen sélectif » de la documentation alors que, selon la jurisprudence, le bénéfice du doute devait être laissé au demandeur. Par exemple, le révérend Ko a écrit dans sa lettre qu'il était allé en Chine continentale où des chrétiens sont persécutés. De plus, le président de la Société d'aide à la Chine a dit que le gouvernement prend des mesures de répression contre les chrétiens dans la province du Fujian. En outre, la Cour fédérale a statué, au paragraphe 71 de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  que la Commission « disposait d'amplement de preuve démontrant que la religion n'est pas pratiquée librement dans les églises reconnues en Chine et que les membres d'églises clandestines sont persécutés ». Le demandeur soutient que la SPR a omis de tenir compte de décisions et d'éléments de preuve convaincants.
Le défendeur
Les conclusions de la SPR concernant la crédibilité n'étaient pas déraisonnables
[21]
Énumérant les problèmes de crédibilité du demandeur relevés par la SPR, le défendeur affirme que les motifs données par celle-ci au soutien de ses conclusions défavorables concernant la crédibilité étaient raisonnables et transparents et étaient fondés sur la preuve dans son ensemble. Il incombait au demandeur de produire des éléments de preuve crédibles qui établissaient, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'il existait une possibilité sérieuse qu'il soit persécuté en raison de ses croyances et de ses pratiques religieuses s'il était renvoyé dans son pays d'origine. Lorsque le demandeur ne produit aucune preuve corroborante, mais s'attend plutôt à ce que le tribunal le croie sur parole, ce dernier a le droit de reconnaître l'absence de documents que le demandeur aurait dû produire pour corroborer son récit.
[22]
La cohérence et la vraisemblance sont des indicateurs importants de la crédibilité du récit d'un demandeur. Voir
Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (2d) 78 (C.A.F.). Il y a une différence importante entre le FRP et le témoignage fait par le demandeur à l'audience, d'une part, et les déclarations qu'il a faites au PDE, d'autre part, au cours de laquelle le demandeur, même s'il a eu à maintes reprises la possibilité de dire la vérité, a nié expressément que sa demande avait un autre fondement que la prétendue extorsion d'argent par des fonctionnaires à l'étal de fruits de sa famille. De plus, il était loisible à la SPR de rejeter les raisons données par le demandeur pour expliquer cette fausse prétention au motif qu'elles étaient invraisemblables, étant donné qu'il était difficile de concilier le fait que le demandeur avait cru que les autorités canadiennes désapprouveraient les activités religieuses illégales qu'il avait menées en Chine et sa déclaration selon laquelle le Canada était un pays qui veille au respect des droits de chacun. Pour que la Cour infirme une décision fondée sur une conclusion défavorable concernant la crédibilité, il faut que le demandeur démontre, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la SPR a commis une erreur manifeste et dominante ayant eu une incidence sur l'appréciation des faits.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Or, le demandeur n'a pas fait cette démonstration en l'espèce.
L'appréciation de la documentation sur les conditions existant en Chine était raisonnable
[23]
La SPR a examiné avec soin la preuve documentaire contenue dans le Cartable national de documentation, ainsi que la preuve documentaire produite par le demandeur. Elle a estimé qu'elle ne disposait d'aucune preuve fiable démontrant que des membres réguliers d'une maison-église clandestine avaient déjà été arrêtés dans le Fujian ou avaient été empêchés de pratiquer leur religion. Même la preuve produite par le demandeur, qui émanait de groupes chrétiens faisant le suivi de cette persécution, ne contenait aucun exemple précis de persécution.
[24]
La SPR n'était pas tenue d'accepter le témoignage du demandeur sans le mettre en doute. La véracité d'un tel témoignage peut être réfutée lorsque la preuve documentaire ne mentionne pas « un fait qu'on pourrait normalement s'attendre à y retrouver ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (C.A.F.), au paragraphe 1. Le demandeur invoque des affaires où la Cour fédérale a statué que la SPR avait omis de tenir compte d'une preuve documentaire convaincante. Ce n'est pas le cas en l'espèce. La manière dont la SPR a soupesé la preuve, même si elle est défavorable au demandeur, ne justifie pas en soi l'intervention de la Cour si la SPR a agi de façon raisonnable.
ANALYSE
[25]
La présente affaire soulève une multitude de questions familières concernant le traitement des chrétiens en Chine. La Cour a été saisie d'un grand nombre d'affaires dont les faits étaient très semblables et dans lesquelles des arguments et des éléments de preuve très similaires ont été présentés afin de contester la décision de la SPR.
[26]
Le demandeur s'appuie essentiellement sur ce qui constitue maintenant un ensemble de faits presque commun. Il est devenu membre d'une maison-église chrétienne clandestine dans la province du Fujian. La maison-église comptait 12 membres. Un pasteur a participé à trois ou quatre rencontres du groupe. Le demandeur a été baptisé à l'une de ces occasions. Tout s'est bien passé jusqu'à ce que les personnes faisant le guet pendant l'une de ces rencontres ont aperçu des agents du BSP s'approcher et ont donné l'alerte. Le demandeur s'est enfui et s'est caché. Il a appris que d'autres membres avaient été arrêtés et que le BSP le recherchait. Des agents du BSP se sont rendus chez sa famille à sept ou huit reprises. Ils n'ont laissé aucune assignation, mais le demandeur a décidé qu'il devait quitter la Chine et, avec l'aide de sa famille, il est entré en contact avec un passeur et est venu au Canada.
[27]
Les faits relatés par le demandeur sont peu différents de ceux allégués par de nombreux autres demandeurs devant la SPR, puis devant la Cour dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire. Lorsque je suis saisi d'affaires de ce genre, les deux parties attirent habituellement mon attention sur des décisions contraires concernant des faits et des éléments de preuve qui ne sont pas si différents. De légères distinctions sont faites et, au bout du compte, la décision dépend en grande partie de la façon dont la SPR a traité la preuve dont elle disposait.
[28]
Dans ce genre de situation, et en particulier lorsque le demandeur ne produit aucune preuve corroborante, je pense que la Cour doit tenir compte des difficultés auxquelles la SPR a été confrontée car c'est à cette dernière qu'il incombe de déterminer qui est un véritable réfugié et qui ne l'est pas. La présomption de véracité, sur laquelle on s'appuie si souvent lorsqu'aucune preuve corroborante n'est produite, ne signifie pas que la SPR n'a pas le droit d'examiner de façon approfondie le récit fait par un demandeur et de le mettre en doute par les moyens légitimes à sa disposition.
[29]
En l'espèce, le récit du demandeur ressemble étroitement à l'ensemble de faits commun décrit plus haut, dont il diffère cependant à deux égards. Premièrement, lorsqu'il est arrivé au Canada par avion, le demandeur n'a jamais dit au PDE qu'il était recherché par le BSP en Chine parce qu'il appartenait à une église chrétienne clandestine. Même s'il a subi un interrogatoire serré au sujet de ce qu'il craignait, il a d'abord dit qu'il avait porté plainte contre des agents du BSP qui extorquaient de l'argent à l'étal de fruits de sa famille et que le BSP le recherchait pour cette raison.
[30]
Le fait que, après avoir changé son récit et invoqué la persécution religieuse dont il aurait fait l'objet, il n'a produit aucune preuve corroborante émanant d'un ami, d'un membre de sa famille ou d'une autre personne qui aurait confirmé des éléments de son récit est important également.
[31]
La SPR avait donc devant elle une personne qui avait changé son récit pour invoquer la persécution religieuse après son arrivée au Canada et qui n'a produit aucune preuve corroborant ce récit.
[32]
Le demandeur a décelé diverses erreurs dans la décision qui, selon lui, étaient susceptibles de contrôle. Pour commencer, je dois dire que je ne pense pas qu'il soit déraisonnable, compte tenu de ces deux problèmes fondamentaux, que la SPR ait eu des doutes au sujet du demandeur et ait estimé qu'il était nécessaire de vérifier et d'apprécier sa crédibilité.
L'appréciation de la crédibilité
[33]
Le demandeur a présenté divers arguments au regard du fait que la SPR avait agi de manière déraisonnable en ne considérant pas que ses allégations de persécution fondée sur ses pratiques religieuses étaient crédibles. Au bout du compte cependant, je crois que le demandeur ne souscrit tout simplement pas aux conclusions de la SPR et qu'il cherche maintenant à convaincre la Cour de ne pas y souscrire non plus. Or, il n'appartient pas à la Cour de substituer sa propre opinion à celle de la SPR sur les questions de crédibilité.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[34]
La SPR a traité de certains des arguments dans sa décision. Par exemple, elle a expliqué clairement pourquoi l'absence de conseil à l'entrevue au PDE ne pouvait pas expliquer le faux récit que le demandeur aurait fait lors de cette entrevue. On peut être d'un autre avis, mais je ne peux pas dire que cette conclusion n'appartient pas aux issues décrites dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[35]
Le demandeur affirme également que la SPR [traduction] « a appliqué un point de vue nord-américain à ce qui était vraisemblable dans les circonstances au lieu d'examiner la vraisemblance du point de vue du demandeur et de la "tête de serpent" ». Le demandeur n'explique pas en quoi son point de vue concernant la vraisemblance est différent de celui de la SPR. Ce qu'il semble vouloir dire, c'est que la SPR n'a pas adopté son point de vue parce qu'elle ne le croyait pas, et il ne souscrit pas à ses motifs. La SPR a manifestement tenu compte du point de vue du demandeur puisqu'elle a fait référence à ses explications. En fait, je ne pense pas qu'il s'agisse réellement d'une question de point de vue. La SPR a exposé ses motifs et il m'est impossible de dire qu'ils ne font pas partie des issues décrites dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[36]
Sans les passer en revue de manière détaillée, je pense qu'il est juste d'affirmer que chacun des points soulevés par le demandeur au regard de la conclusion relative à la crédibilité est valable dans une certaine mesure. En fait, j'estime qu'il n'aurait pas été déraisonnable que la SPR accepte les explications du demandeur et lui donne gain de cause. Je ne peux pas dire cependant, compte tenu du changement important touchant le fondement principal du récit de la persécution fait par le demandeur, de l'absence totale de preuve corroborant ce récit et des documents objectifs sur le pays, que l'appréciation de la crédibilité faite par la SPR n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. On peut ne pas être d'accord avec la SPR sur la question de la crédibilité, mais, à mon avis, si la Cour intervenait maintenant, elle apprécierait la preuve elle-même et substituerait sa propre opinion à celle de la SPR, ce qu'elle ne peut pas faire.
[37]
Les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité tirées par la SPR sont fondées notamment sur son appréciation de la preuve matérielle et sur sa conclusion selon laquelle, bien que les chrétiens soient susceptibles d'être persécutés dans d'autres parties de la Chine, cette preuve ne démontre pas que le demandeur serait persécuté ou serait exposé à un risque mentionné à l'article 97 dans la province du Fujian s'il pratiquait le christianisme comme il a choisi de le faire. Cette conclusion recoupe en partie l'appréciation de cette preuve par la SPR au regard de la demande présentée sur place par le demandeur.
La demande sur place
[38]
Les prétentions présentées par le conseil du demandeur à la SPR relativement à la preuve documentaire matérielle soulèvent des questions controversées qui font souvent l'objet de débats. Le demandeur se plaint du fait que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte de ses prétentions et de certaines des questions soulevées et n'en a pas traité dans la décision. Après avoir examiné les prétentions et la décision, j'arrive à la conclusion que la SPR n'a peut-être pas traité des prétentions de la façon dont le demandeur pense qu'elle aurait dû le faire, mais elle a parlé de l'essentiel.
[39]
En fait, je crois que la SPR a pris un soin particulier à apprécier la preuve qui lui a été présentée et à tirer ses conclusions. Elle a affirmé essentiellement que les chrétiens se trouvent en mauvaise position dans de nombreuses parties de la Chine, mais qu'il y a des différences importantes entre les différentes provinces et entre les villes et les campagnes. La SPR a constaté à nouveau que la province du Fujian est relativement libérale et que la preuve ne permettait pas de conclure que le demandeur serait exposé à « une possibilité sérieuse d'être persécuté s'il pratiquait la forme de christianisme qu'il a choisie dans la province de Fujian s'il y retournait »:
[23] J'ai examiné la preuve documentaire du [demandeur] afin de vérifier si elle comportait des éléments de preuve qui contredisaient ceux contenus dans le cartable national de documentation et je n'y ai trouvé aucun document qui indiquait que les membres ordinaires de maisons églises ont été arrêtés ou détenus dans la province de Fujian ou qu'ils se sont vu empêcher de pratiquer la religion qu'ils ont choisie de quelconque façon notable. Je n'ai trouvé aucun document indiquant que des ministres du culte chrétien ont été arrêtés, déclarés coupables ou torturés au Fujian. Dans les documents présentés par le [demandeur], deux lettres rédigées par le président de l'association d'aide à la Chine, dont deux bureaux sont situés au Texas et à Washington, font exception à l'absence de document faisant référence au Fujian. Dans ces lettres, l'auteur a écrit que des cas de répression religieuse continuaient de se produire dans chaque province de la Chine, y compris les provinces de Guangdong et de Fujian. Il ajoute que la répression des activités religieuses non autorisées constituait une campagne nationale imposée par le parti communiste de la Chine. Toutefois, l'auteur ne fournit aucun exemple précis concernant quelque acte de persécution que ce soit qui aurait déjà eu lieu dans ces deux provinces. Il s'agit d'une affirmation non étayée par d'autres éléments de preuve. De plus, sa conclusion (et les conclusions de certaines sources chrétiennes, mentionnées à la pièce 6) selon laquelle la répression dans la pratique constituait une campagne à l'échelle nationale imposée par les dirigeants ne concorde pas avec les éléments de preuve documentaire précis susmentionnés selon lesquels l'oppression religieuse réelle est largement répandue en Chine, et que les provinces de Fujian et de Guangdong sont considérées comme étant tolérantes.
[24] L'absence de mention dans les documents du [demandeur] de cas de répression au Fujian est significative. Presque tous les documents du [demandeur] proviennent de sources chrétiennes qui font le suivi de la répression des chrétiens en Chine. Ces sources relèvent des incidents où des chrétiens sont arrêtés, incarcérés, rééduqués dans des camps de travail et torturés par les autorités chinoises parce qu'ils ont pratiqué des formes non autorisées de christianisme. Les éléments de preuve documentaire du [demandeur] proviennent de sources comme le Epoch Times, Pilgrims Covenant Church, Mennonite Brethren Herald, BosNews Life Asia Service, Radio Free China, Voice of the Martyrs, en plus du WorldNetDaily, de Human Rights without Frontiers et du Département d'État des États-Unis.
[25] Les éléments de preuve documentaire du [demandeur] corroborent ceux figurant dans le cartable national de documentation selon lesquels il y a moins qu'une simple possibilité qu'un membre ordinaire d'une maison-église protestante clandestine au Fujian soit exposé à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution. Si le [demandeur] habitait dans une autre province chinoise comme le Shandong, le Xinjiang, le Sichnan, le Hubei, le Yunnan, le Henan, le Heilongjiang, le Shaanxi, Beijing ou l'Anhui, une conclusion différente aurait pu être tirée. Le [demandeur] a trouvé des éléments de preuve documentaire sur ces provinces qui indiquent que des chrétiens ordinaires et leurs chefs ont souffert parce qu'ils pratiquaient le christianisme de la façon dont ils le voulaient. La province de Fujian n'y est pas mentionnée. J'estime que, particulièrement compte tenu du caractère revendicateur des nombreuses sources documentaires concernant le christianisme fournies par le [demandeur], s'il y avait eu des cas de persécution religieuse contre des églises chrétiennes au Fujian, de telles sources en auraient fait mention.
[26] Je souligne également que, selon l'association d'aide à la Chine, en 2007, des maisons églises ont fait l'objet de persécution dans 18 provinces. Il y a 22 provinces en Chine, ce qui indique que, du moins, selon les renseignements dont dispose cette association, il est possible de conclure que de tels actes de persécution n'ont pas eu lieu dans certaines provinces de la Chine.
[40]
À nouveau, je ne vois pas en quoi la manière dont la SPR a apprécié et soupesé les documents à sa disposition sur les conditions existant en Chine ou les conclusions qu'elle a tirées en s'appuyant sur ces documents étaient déficientes ou déraisonnables.
[41]
Le demandeur a beaucoup insisté sur ce que le révérend Ko a dit au sujet de la persécution des chrétiens en Chine, mais la SPR a expliqué de manière raisonnable pourquoi cette preuve ne peut permettre de conclure qu'il existe une possibilité sérieuse que le demandeur soit persécuté s'il est renvoyé dans la province du Fujian. La situation varie d'une région à l'autre en Chine et le Fujian est, avec le Guangdong, la province chinoise la plus libérale.
[42]
Le demandeur attire l'attention de la Cour en particulier sur le rapport sur la destruction de maisons-églises dans la province du Fujian qui est mentionné à la page 92 du DCT. Il s'agit d'une réponse à une demande d'information datée du 22 juin 2007 qui figure dans le Cartable national de documentation:
Selon la CAA, tandis que le nombre de descentes dans les maisons-églises a diminué en Chine en 2006, le nombre de démolitions et de fermetures forcées de maisons-églises a augmenté par rapport à l'année précédente (janv. 2007, 19). Dans la province de Zhejiang, trois maisons-églises auraient été démolies au cours de l'année (ibid.; voir aussi AFP 23 déc. 2006; ibid. 4 août 2006; The Washington Post 1er oct. 2006). Des sources ont aussi signalé la destruction de maisons-églises dans les provinces de Jilin et de Fujian (CAA janv. 2007, 19). On a fait état de la fermeture forcée de maisons-églises dans les provinces de l'Anhui (ibid.; AsiaNews 12 déc. 2006), de Guangdong, de Shandong, dans la Région autonome de la Mongolie intérieure et à Shanghai (CAA janv. 2007, 19).
[43]
Il s'agit du seul document faisant expressément état d'une possible persécution dans la province du Fujian qui est produit par le demandeur. À mon avis, on ne peut pas dire que le fait qu'il y soit expressément question de maisons-églises existant dans cette province rend l'appréciation de la preuve faite par la SPR déraisonnable si la prépondérance de la preuve dont celle-ci disposait est prise en compte.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Yu
).
[44]
Le demandeur attire à juste titre l'attention de la Cour sur ce que le juge Michel Shore a dit au sujet du même élément de preuve dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 15 à 18:
La destruction de maisons-églises au Fujian est en soi la preuve que les autorités chinoises de la province ne permettent pas aux chrétiens de pratiquer leur religion librement. La liberté de religion comprend le droit des personnes d'exercer publiquement leur culte, individuellement ou collectivement, pourvu que la façon choisie pour le faire n'interfère pas avec les droits fondamentaux d'autrui. En détruisant des maisons-églises, le gouvernement chinois porte atteinte à ce droit et inflige une persécution religieuse.
[...]
La Commission a conclu que la preuve ne montrait pas que la demanderesse a de bonnes raisons de craindre la persécution en pratiquant dans une maison-église non enregistrée. Pour tirer cette conclusion, la Commission a examiné la preuve documentaire sur le Fujian et s'est particulièrement concentrée sur les rapports d'arrestations de chrétiens non enregistrés au Fujian et a conclu qu'il n'en existe aucun. La Commission s'est également concentrée sur la taille de l'église de la demanderesse, qui compte de vingt à trente membres, et a conclu qu'une église de cette taille n'est pas tenue de s'enregistrer.
Bien qu'il n'y ait possiblement pas eu de rapport concernant l'arrestation de chrétiens au Fujian, des rapports de persécution de maisons-églises existent bel et bien, car la destruction de maisons-églises situées dans cette province a été rapportée. L'Association d'aide à la Chine, considérée par la Commission comme étant une source fiable et réputée, en a elle-même fait état (page 106, au paragraphe 3 du dossier du tribunal [la Commission] ).
La destruction de maisons-églises au Fujian est en soi la preuve que les autorités chinoises de la province ne permettent pas aux chrétiens de pratiquer leur religion librement. La liberté de religion comprend le droit des personnes d'exercer publiquement leur culte, individuellement ou collectivement, pourvu que la façon choisie pour le faire n'interfère pas avec les droits fondamentaux d'autrui. En détruisant des maisons-églises, le gouvernement chinois porte atteinte à ce droit et inflige une persécution religieuse.
Vu la preuve concernant la destruction de maisons-églises dans la province du Fujian, la demanderesse a des raisons concrètes de craindre la persécution si elle choisit d'exercer son droit de pratiquer sa religion librement.
[45]
À mon avis, on ne peut pas contester la conclusion du juge Shore selon laquelle la destruction de maisons-églises peut démontrer que les autorités chinoises se livrent à de la persécution en portant atteinte aux droits religieux fondamentaux dans la province du Fujian.
[46]
Chaque affaire dépend cependant des faits et de la manière dont la SPR apprécie la preuve. En l'espèce, les rapports faisant état de la destruction de maisons-églises au Fujian en 2007 doivent être considérés à la lumière de tous les autres éléments de preuve présentés à la SPR concernant cette province afin de décider si les conclusions générales que la SPR a tirées relativement aux risques auxquels le demandeur y serait exposé sont raisonnables. La SPR n'a pas seulement tenu compte des arrestations et des détentions; elle s'est aussi demandé si des chrétiens du Fujian avaient été « empêch[és] de pratiquer la religion qu'ils ont choisie de quelconque façon notable ». La Cour a confirmé la décision rendue par la SPR dans d'autres affaires où il était question de la prétendue persécution de chrétiens au Fujian:
Yu
, précitée;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[47]
Par ailleurs, il ne convient pas de se fonder sur les déclarations et les conclusions générales formulées par la Cour dans des affaires comme
Song
, précitée, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  alors que la preuve ne permettait pas de croire qu'il existait une possibilité sérieuse que le demandeur soit persécuté au Fujian. Ce n'est pas parce que la Cour a pu conclure dans une affaire que la situation des chrétiens au Fujian n'avait peut-être pas été bien appréciée et qu'elle a renvoyé l'affaire pour réexamen que la SPR commet une erreur susceptible de contrôle en l'espèce en appréciant la situation au Fujian d'une manière qui est défavorable au demandeur.
[48]
Contrairement à ce que le demandeur allègue, l'examen effectué par la SPR des conditions existant en Chine n'était pas [traduction] « sélectif ».Il ressort de la décision que la SPR a examiné avec sérieux tous les éléments de preuve dont elle disposait et qu'elle a tiré des conclusions qui étaient fondées sur une preuve matérielle.
[49]
Au bout du compte, je reconnais que les conclusions de la SPR concernant la demande sur place pourraient être contestées avec force et qu'une conclusion favorable au demandeur n'aurait pas été déraisonnable, mais la SPR a effectué une analyse complète et je ne peux pas dire que ses conclusions n'appartiennent pas aux issues décrites dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Si la Cour intervenait, elle apprécierait la preuve elle-même et substituerait sa propre opinion concernant la situation au Fujian à celle de la SPR.
[50]
Les avocats conviennent qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier. La Cour est aussi de cet avis.

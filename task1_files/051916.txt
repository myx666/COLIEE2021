I. Introduction
[1]
Scott, J.
: This is an application for judicial review, pursuant to section 72 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [
IRPA
], of a decision rendered by the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division (the Board) on June 28, 2012, determining that Mr. Mohamad Rashid Yousif (the Applicant) is not a Convention Refugee nor a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the
IRPA
. The determinative issue for the Board was credibility.
[2]
For the reasons that follow, the application is allowed.
II. Facts
[3]
The Applicant is a Syrian citizen of Kurdish descent.
[4]
In his Personal Information Form [PIF], the Applicant claims that one of his older brothers, Seyed Ahmed, has been involved in Kurdish folkloric activities and was arrested by Syrian authorities while participating in Newroz festivities in or around 1990. He was detained for approximately two months and then expelled from high school. The brother later joined the
peshmerga
(Kurdish resistance) and was killed in combat in 1993.
[5]
The Applicant also claims that another one of his brothers, Mohamad Fayek, was arrested by military security while he was serving in the Syrian army further to an argument with an officer. He was allegedly beaten, abused and sent to Al Tadmour prison where he was imprisoned and tortured for fourteen months. Once released from prison, the Applicant's family purportedly received a letter from Mohamad Fayek indicating that he too had joined the
peshmerga
. The Applicant explains that it was Mohamad Fayek that informed the family of Seyed Ahmed's death. The Applicant and his family have had no contact with Mohamad Fayek since they received his letter.
[6]
The Applicant alleges that the
mukhabarat
(Syrian Intelligence) seemed to know of Mohamad Fayek's involvement with the
peshmerga
and on several occasions took his father and older brother, Mohamad Khaled, away for questioning. The two were allegedly beaten and abused throughout.
[7]
The Applicant took Kurdish lessons with an Iraqi Kurd. In the winter of 1995, the house where the Applicant took his lessons was raided by the
mukhabarat
. The Applicant was detained for three months during which time he was beaten and doused with cold water.
[8]
The Applicant served in the Syrian army from September 2000 to March 2003. After completing his military service, the Applicant became interested in the Yekiti party, a banned political group which promotes Kurdish rights. The Applicant's father was concerned about his son's involvement with that party and urged him to leave Syria. In January 2005, the Applicant fled to Greece, crossing illegally into the country through Turkey.
[9]
The Applicant indicates that he applied for refugee status in Greece and was allowed to remain in the country on a temporary basis so long as he renewed his status every six months. The Applicant's status in Greece did not permit him to work. The Applicant claims that
mukhabarat
questioned his family about his whereabouts while he was in Greece.
[10]
After two years in Greece, the Applicant wanted to return to Syria. Before he returned, his brother paid to receive information as to whether the Applicant was officially wanted by the
mukhabarat
. Despite the encouraging news, the Applicant nevertheless decided to re-enter Syria surreptitiously.
[11]
Upon arriving home, the Applicant pursued his interest in the Kurdish cause, obtained Yekiti literature, attended meetings in various houses and also donated money to the Yekiti party.
[12]
On September 15, 2008, the
mukhabarat
conducted a search of the Applicant's home and found some of his books on Kurdish history and language. They arrested and detained him until November 2, 2008. While in detention, the Applicant was beaten and abused.
[13]
On December 24, 2008, the Applicant was arrested yet again after being found in possession of a Yekiti brochure. The Applicant was interrogated, insulted and badly abused. The Applicant's brother was able to secure his release on February 26, 2009 after paying a bribe. The Applicant was released on condition that he report to the
mukhabarat
when required and inform them of any change of address.
[14]
The Applicant was afraid of having to report to the
mukhabarat
as he had heard of others in a similar situation being jailed for years. In order to lower his profile, the Applicant moved and began farming work. After a few months had passed, the
mukhabarat
came to the Applicant's house searching for him. They apparently wanted him to sign a document acknowledging an upcoming court date. Upon hearing this, the Applicant decided to leave Syria.
[15]
With the help of a smuggler, the Applicant fled the country on May 17, 2010 and headed to Greece. Because of his previous experiences living in Greece, the Applicant made his way to Canada and arrived on June 24, 2010.

IV. Issues and standard of review
A. Issues
1. Was there a breach of procedural fairness as a result of the interpretation issues during the hearing?
2. Did the Board err in making its credibility finding?
3. Did the Board err in assessing the objective, documentary evidence?
B. Standard of review
[17]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], Justice Martineau held that "it is ... necessary for the refugee claimant to be heard and for his account to be understood by the panel in the first place. Therefore, the quality of the translation before the panel on its own can raise an issue of procedural fairness, and it is the standard of correctness that applies in such cases".
[18]
The standard of review applicable to the Board's credibility findings is reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 53;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
V. Parties' submissions
A. Applicant's submissions
[20]
The Applicant submits that there was breach of his right to procedural fairness as a result of serious problems with the quality of interpretation during his hearing. The Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] held that refugee claimants appearing before the Board are entitled to interpretation that is "continuous, precise, competent, impartial and contemporaneous" and that applicants are not required to prove that they've been prejudiced in order to demonstrate a breach of that right ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 4). However, as this Court found in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
"As important as this right is, the burden on a person raising interpretation issues is significant. Such a claim must overcome the presumption that a translator, who has taken an oath to provide faithful translation, has acted in a manner contrary to the oath. Simply alleging mistranslation will not be sufficient - the burden is to show that on a balance of probabilities mis-translation occurred."
[21]
The Applicant submits that he and Mr. Huseyin Sertkaya (a certified interpreter in Kurdish and Turkish at the Board) have provided Affidavits asserting serious mistakes and discrepancies in the interpreter's work.
[22]
Although the Applicant contends he need not establish that he was prejudiced as a result of the poor interpretation, he notes that he did suffer a prejudice in this case. The Applicant points out that the Board's negative credibility findings were based on his "evasiveness", "non-responsiveness", "poor demeanour" and the fact that the Applicant had to be asked the same question several times before he answered. The Applicant contends that all of these issues were the result of poor interpretation. Given that the Board's decision was based solely on credibility, the Applicant argues that he suffered a significant prejudice as a result of the poor quality of the interpretation.
[23]
The Applicant acknowledges that the Federal Court of Appeal, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, held that an Applicant will be found to have waived his rights to competent interpretation if they do not object to its poor quality at the first opportunity during the hearing. At paragraph 18, the Court stated as follows:
"As Pelletier J. observed, if the appellant's argument is correct a claimant experiencing difficulty with the quality of the interpretation at a hearing could do nothing throughout the entire hearing and yet be able to successfully attack the determination at some later date. Indeed, where a claimant choses [
sic
] to do nothing despite his or her concern with the quality of the interpretation, the Refugee Division would itself have no way of knowing that the interpretation was in any respect deficient. The claimant is always in the best position to know whether the interpretation is accurate and to make any concern with respect to accuracy known to the Refugee Division during the course of the hearing,
unless there are exceptional circumstances for not doing so"
[Applicant's emphasis].
[24]
In the present case, the Applicant's counsel objected to the assigned interpreter before the hearing because he knew that particular interpreter to have poor English language skills. The Board attempted to find another interpreter but failed to do so. The Board then indicated that the assigned interpreter was accredited and that they would proceed with him.
[25]
Because the Applicant's English is limited, he was unable to assess whether the interpreter was translating his testimony in a continuous, precise, competent, impartial and contemporaneous manner. He only realized how poor it was when he reviewed the decision of the Panel and then reviewed the audio recording of the hearing. Although the Applicant's friend was present as an observer and informed the Applicant's counsel that he noticed some errors, the Applicant's counsel told him that there was nothing that he could do, having already objected before the hearing and been told that the interpreter was accredited and that the hearing would proceed with that interpreter. The Applicant alleges that, being unaware of the seriousness of the errors in interpretation and that his counsel objected prior to the commencement of the hearing, the Court should not find that he waived his right to object to the quality of the interpretation.
[26]
The Applicant's next claim is that the Board erred in making its credibility finding. The Board drew an adverse inference from the Applicant's failure to indicate in his PIF narrative that he had received medical attention for the injuries he suffered during his third detention. The Applicant submits that the fact he adduced a medical note after the hearing to support his allegation that he was mistreated should dismiss the Board's adverse finding.
[27]
The medical note in question was written by Dr. Jamal Al Hussein. In it, he indicates that the Applicant "had signs of torture on his body and traces on the skin". The Board's decision to assign this little weight and to draw a negative inference because of the Applicant's failure to mention his visit with the doctor in his PIF is unreasonable according to the Applicant as the Board did not question the authenticity of the doctor's note. He further argues that it constitutes a corroborative document that supports his claim that he was abused by the Syrian authorities.
[28]
Regarding the Board's negative credibility finding based on the Applicant's failure to indicate at the Port of Entry that he had been detained in 1995, the Applicant submits that the Board failed to address his counsel's statement that the omission was of little relevance to the Applicant's fears in 2010, as it was the Applicant's last two detentions in 2008 that prompted him to fear for his safety and flee Syria.
[29]
The Applicant's final contention is that the Board erred in law by failing to assess whether he satisfied the subjective and objective components of the test for refugee status even though it had found him not credible.
[30]
The Applicant contends that a finding that an applicant is not credible is not determinative of the question of whether or not he is a Convention refugee. Rather, even if the Board finds an applicant not credible, it must still assess whether he meets the subjective or objective components of a Convention refugee definition based on the objective documentary evidence adduced.
[31]
In the case at bar, the evidence before the Board was that the Applicant's two brothers had allegedly joined the Kurdish
peshmerga
in order to fight for Kurdistan and the Kurdish people. Moreover, the evidence was that if the Applicant's case was refused and he was returned to Syria, he would be returning to that country as a failed asylum seeker.
[32]
Although the Board assessed whether the Applicant would be at risk on the basis of his Kurdish ethnicity, it failed to assess whether the objective documentary evidence established that the Applicant would be at risk in Syria as a result of his membership in a particular social group, being his family and a failed asylum seeker.
[33]
The documentary evidence before the Board indicated that family members of politically active Kurds in Syria face interrogation, harassment, detention, pressure and intimidation from the Syrian authorities. Moreover, the evidence indicated that failed asylum seekers face detention and interrogation, including a danger of torture, upon return to Syria. This evidence should have been addressed by the Board in its assessment of the Applicant's claim. By failing to do so, the Board has erred in law.
B. Respondent's submissions
[34]
Before responding to the Applicant's arguments, the Respondent provided the following summary of the elements the Board based its credibility findings on:
"(a) In his PIF and oral testimony, the Applicant alleged that in 1995, when he was 14 years-old, he was detained and physically abused for three months. However, he was unable to corroborate this alleged detention with any documentation. The Board also noted that the Applicant failed to mention this detention in Question 37 of his IMM 5611. The Applicant was unable to adequately explain this omission.
(b) The Applicant alleged that in 2005 he fled Syria and sought asylum in Greece. While he was likely not accepted as a refugee neither was he asked to leave Greece. Nonetheless, the Applicant voluntarily re-availed to Syria, evading border controls as he believed it was still perilous for him there. The Applicant was unable to adequately explain why he would voluntarily return to a country that allegedly detained and abused him for three months.
(c) The Applicant was unable to corroborate, with any form of documentation, that he ever made donations to the Yekiti Party or that he was detained in 2008.
(d) The Applicant testified that he sought medical attention for injuries he allegedly suffered during his detentions of 2008. However, the Board noted that the Applicant failed to mention seeking such medical attention in his PIF, as Question 31 specifically enjoined the Applicant to do.
(e) At the hearing the Applicant amended paragraph 15 of his PIF narrative to state that his last alleged detention in Syria took place from December 24, 2008 to February 26, 2009, rather than January 24, 2009. The Board noted that this amendment doubled the length of his alleged detention and allowed his narrative to retroactively comport with the answer he gave in his IMM5611. While the Applicant alleged that the error was the result of a poor translator the Board found that explanation to be lacking." (Respondent's further memorandum of arguments, pages 3 and 4)
[35]
As to the first issue, the Respondent submits that the errors of interpretation that occurred during the hearing were immaterial to the Board's decision and, as a result, the Court should not intervene. The Respondent relies on the following passage from
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 30:
"I have reviewed each of the alleged errors and failures in translation and am of the view that none impacted the Board's understanding of the testimonies or the basis for its specific credibility findings. Since the errors were not material to the ultimate finding, this Court should not intervene:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2011 FC 155 at para 10."
[36]
Even if the Applicant establishes that the errors were material to the Board's decision, the Respondent contends that the Applicant waived his right to raise the issue before this Court by failing to object to the poor interpretation at the first opportunity during the hearing.
[37]
Regarding the Applicant's claim that his former counsel objected to the interpreter before the hearing began, the Respondent argues that such an objection does not meet the test which is to object to the quality of the interpretation at the earliest opportunity. Such an objection must necessarily occur
during
the hearing (i.e. when the interpretation errors are actual as opposed to theoretical).
[38]
As for the Applicant's assertion that his responsibility to object during the hearing was vitiated by his former counsel's advice to the contrary, the Respondent submits that such a claim lacks merit. For one, if the Applicant's former counsel was advised during the hearing that the interpretation was poor, he had an ethical responsibility to object regardless of any pre-hearing discussion. Second, if the Applicant is asserting that he would have objected but for his former counsel's advice, than what he is really asserting is that his right to procedural fairness was breached due to his counsel's incompetence.
[39]
The Respondent underlines that this Court has held that "[a] litigant cannot validly cite a professional fault on the part of his former counsel without supplying the latter's explanations regarding the error complained of and with no evidence that the matter has been presented to the Bar of which the lawyer is a member for investigation" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Respondent points to the lack of evidence that the Applicant ever attempted to do either in this case. The Respondent consequently concludes that the Applicant is barred from raising the issue of counsel's incompetence and that he has also waived his right to raise the issue of poor interpretation by failing to object at the very first opportunity.
[40]
As for the Applicant's argument that the Board unreasonably drew a negative inference from the fact that he failed to mention, in his PIF, having received medical treatment further to his final detention, the Respondent insists that such an inference falls within a range of possible outcomes.
[41]
The Respondent submits that the negative inference is reasonable in light of 1) the instructions under Question 31 of the PIF which reads: ". . . [s]tate whether you have received any medical or psychological treatment or assessments in Canada or elsewhere relating to your claim"; and 2) when the Board asked the Applicant to explain the omission during the hearing, his response was "just wrote down what happened in jail", which was not an adequate explanation in light of the PIF's specific instructions.
[42]
On the third issue, the Respondent argues that the Applicant's contention that the Board failed to adequately assess whether he would be at risk in Syria due to his family's affiliation with Kurdish activists is without merit for two reasons. First, the Board cannot be said to have failed to assess this risk when, at paragraph 39 of its reasons, it stated that it has "rejected the allegations that the claimant would be targeted because of his affiliation with his family, which allegedly included Kurd activists and fighters". Second, the Applicant himself acknowledges that his evidence showed only that his brothers, "
allegedly
joined the
peshmerga
"; accordingly, the Applicant cannot argue that he has established the alleged risk to his family and thus cannot extrapolate that risk to himself.
[43]
Finally, the Respondent argues that the Applicant's claim that the Board erred in failing to assess his risk, as a failed refugee claimant, is also without merit because neither the Applicant nor his former counsel raised this risk in his PIF or post-hearing submissions. Where a claimant fails to raise an allegation of risk, the Board is not required to canvas the documentary evidence for risk factors on the claimant's behalf. The Respondent cites the following passage from
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in support of this assertion:
[14] The applicant submits that a "long line of decisions" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2006 FC 773;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)) from the Federal Court have held that once the Board accepts that a claimant is who they claim to be, the Board has an obligation to canvass objective country condition materials notwithstanding a negative credibility finding. The applicant says that since the Board accepted that he was of Roma ethnicity, it was an error not to consider country condition evidence.
[15] The applicant's submission must fail in light of the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2008 FCA 381, wherein, in answering a certified question, the Court stated:
[W]here the Board makes a general finding that the claimant lacks credibility, that determination is sufficient to dispose of the claim unless there is independent and credible documentary evidence in the record capable of supporting a positive disposition of the claim. The claimant bears the onus of demonstrating there was such evidence.
[16] The applicant did not present any "independent and credible documentary evidence" to the Board, and as the onus rested upon him, the Board had no duty to canvass country condition evidence.
VI. Analysis
1. Was there a breach of procedural fairness as a result of the interpretation issues during the hearing?
[44]
The first issue that needs to be addressed is whether the Applicant needs to show that the interpretation failings had a direct influence on the Board's decision. Relying on the judgment in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, the Applicant argues that he doesn't. Citing this Court's decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above, the Respondent submits the opposite.
[45]
While there is no need to establish a prejudice in order to prove a breach of procedural fairness based on inadequate interpretation (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> cited above), the Applicant
is
required to demonstrate that the breach of procedural fairness was material to the Board's decision in order for this Court to intervene (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 52-53).
[46]
The Applicant argues that the difficulties encountered with the interpretation at the hearing were material to the Board's decision. More specifically, the Applicant submits that the Board's determinative credibility finding was based on his "evasiveness", "non-responsiveness" and "poor demeanour" which in turn resulted from the poor quality of interpretation.
[47]
The Court disagrees. The Board specifically mentions on more than one occasion in its decision that it will not make a negative inference as to credibility from the claimant's poor demeanour or his non-responsiveness (cf. Reasons at paragraphs 15 and 33). The Board's negative credibility finding stems in great part from the lack of corroborative evidence adduced by the Applicant (see paragraphs 18, 20 and 29) and the fact that he omitted significant parts of his story in his PIF (see paragraphs 23,27, 30 and 31). The Applicant has, therefore, failed to demonstrate that the errors in the interpretation were material to the Board's determinative credibility finding.
[48]
Having concluded that the quality of the translation was not determinative in the present case, the question as to whether the Applicant waived his right to raise the issue becomes academic. The Court would nonetheless underline that to properly protect the Applicant's right to raise the issue of inadequate translation, the Applicant's former counsel should, as a minimum, have insisted that the objection he raised about the interpreter's qualifications before the hearing commenced, be recorded when the hearing began.
2. Did the Board err in making its credibility finding?
[49]
The Applicant's claim was denied because of the Board's negative credibility finding. The Applicant argues that the Board's negative credibility inferences are based on his failure to indicate in his PIF narrative that he visited a doctor after his detentions in 2008/2009. He submits that such a conclusion was unreasonable. After the hearing before the Board, the Applicant adduced a note from the doctor who treated him, Dr. Jamal Al Hussein. That evidence corroborated his story of being detained and abused by the Syrian authorities. The Applicant contends that the Board acted unreasonably in assigning less weight to the note than it normally would have simply because the Applicant provided an inadequate explanation for his failure to mention it in his PIF narrative. The exchange in question went as follows:
"PRESIDING MEMBER
: Thank you. Sir, why did you not mention this medical attention in your narrative, as is required in the instructions to the narrative?
CLAIMANT
: I just write down what happened with me in the jail, how I be like, you know." (Hearing's transcript, page 289 of the Applicant's Record)
[50]
Both parties acknowledge that the authenticity of the doctor's note was not questioned by the Board. The Respondent contends that assigning less weight to the note due to the Applicant's failure to mention his visit to the doctor and his non-responsive explanation for not doing so was reasonable. This Court disagrees. While the note does not constitute conclusive evidence
per se
that the Applicant's story is true (i.e. that he was detained and abused by Syrian authorities in 2008/2009), it is nonetheless a significant piece of corroborative evidence. Its impact should not have been diminished for such insubstantial reasons.
[51]
As the note's authenticity was not questioned, then its weight should not have been affected by the Applicant's failure to mention his visit to the doctor in his PIF or his inadequate explanation for not doing so. The Court finds that the Board's minimization of the weight assigned to the doctor's note was capricious and, therefore, unreasonable. While the Board did raise other credibility concerns, it is impossible for the Court to determine what the outcome would have been had the Board properly assessed the doctor's note. As Justice Dawson explained in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[9] I have considered the submissions of the Minister that the panel's decision should not be set aside in light of other credibility findings made by the panel. I am not prepared to speculate, however, on what the outcome would have been had the panel not committed a reviewable error with respect to the central element of Mr. Khan's claim.
[52]
The Board committed a reviewable error by assigning little weight to a crucial piece of corroborative evidence that went to the very heart of the Applicant's claim without reasonable justification. For that reason, this application is allowed, the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated June 28, 2012 is set aside and the application is remitted for re-determination before a differently constituted panel of the Refugee Protection Division.
[53]
Given the Court's conclusion on this second issue there is no need to address the other issues raised by the Applicant.
JUDGMENT
[54]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. This application for judicial review is allowed and the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated June 28, 2012 is hereby set aside;
2. The decision is remitted for re-determination before a differently constituted panel of the Refugee Protection Division; and
3. There is no question of general interest for certification.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Scott
[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu de l'article 72 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR], qui vise la décision datée du 28 juin 2012 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [la Commission] a statué que M. Mohamad Rashid Yousif [le demandeur] n'était pas un réfugié au sens de la Convention ni une personne à protéger au sens des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR. La question déterminante aux yeux de la Commission était celle de la crédibilité.
[2]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, la demande est accueillie.
II. Faits
[3]
Le demandeur est un citoyen syrien d'origine kurde.
[4]
Le demandeur affirme dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels [FRP] que l'un de ses frères aînés, Seyed Ahmed, a participé à des activités de folklore kurde et qu'il a été arrêté par les autorités syriennes pendant qu'il prenait part aux célébrations du Newroz aux alentours de l'année 1990. Le frère du demandeur a été détenu pendant environ deux mois, puis expulsé de son école secondaire. Il a ensuite joint les rangs des peshmergas (des résistants kurdes), e il a été tué au combat en 1993.
[5]
Le demandeur soutient également que des agents de la sécurité militaire ont arrêté un autre de ses frères, Mohamad Fayek, parce qu'il s'était disputé avec un officier pendant qu'il servait dans l'armée syrienne. On lui aurait infligé des coups et des mauvais traitements, et on l'aurait transféré à la prison d'Al Tadmour, où il est resté emprisonné et a été torturé pendant quatorze mois. Une fois libéré, Mohamad Fayek aurait envoyé une lettre à sa famille pour l'informer que lui aussi avait rejoint les peshmergas. C'est Mohamad Fayek, explique le demandeur, qui a informé la famille du décès de Seyed Ahmed. Le demandeur et sa famille n'ont plus eu aucun autre contact avec Mohamad Fayek après la réception de sa lettre.
[6]
Selon le demandeur, le Mukhabarat (le service de renseignement syrien) semblait au courant que Mohamad Fayek avait joint les rangs des peshmergas et, à plusieurs reprises, des agents du service sont venus chercher son père et son frère aîné, Mohamad Khaled, pour les interroger. Des coups et des mauvais traitements leur auraient été infligés tout au long des interrogatoires.
[7]
Le demandeur a suivi des cours de kurde auprès d'un Kurde iraquien. Pendant l'hiver 1995, des agents du Mukhabarat ont fait un raid dans la maison où les cours étaient donnés. Le demandeur a été détenu pendant trois mois, au cours desquels il a été battu et arrosé d'eau froide.

Le demandeur a servi au sein de l'armée syrienne entre septembre 2000 et mars 2003. Une fois son service militaire terminé, le demandeur a commencé à s'intéresser au parti Yekiti, un groupe politique interdit promouvant les droits des Kurdes. Son père s'est inquiété de sa participation aux activités de ce parti, et il l'a exhorté à quitter la Syrie. En janvier 2005, le demandeur s'est enfui en Grèce, où il est arrivé après avoir traversé illégalement la Turquie.
[9]
Le demandeur déclare qu'il a demandé l'asile en Grèce et qu'on lui a permis d'y demeurer de manière temporaire, à la condition de faire proroger son statut tous les six mois. Le demandeur n'a pas obtenu en Grèce un statut lui permettant de travailler. Il soutient que, pendant son séjour dans ce pays, des agents du Mukhabarat ont interrogé des membres de sa famille pour savoir où il se trouvait.
[10]
Après deux années passées en Grèce, le demandeur a voulu retourner en Syrie. Toutefois, avant qu'il ne s'exécute son frère a versé de l'argent afin d'apprendre si le Mukhabarat était toujours officiellement à sa recherche. Malgré des nouvelles encourageantes, le demandeur a décidé de rentrer en Syrie clandestinement.
[11]
Le demandeur a continué de s'intéresser à la cause kurde une fois de retour à la maison. Il a obtenu de la documentation du parti Yekiti, auquel il a versé de l'argent et il a assisté à des réunions tenues dans différentes maisons.
[12]
Le 15 septembre 2008, le Mukhabarat a procédé à une fouille à la maison du demandeur et y a trouvé des livres sur l'histoire et la langue kurdes. Le demandeur a été arrêté et détenu jusqu'au 2 novembre 2008. Pendant sa détention, il a été battu et a subi d'autres mauvais traitements.
[13]
Le 24 décembre 2008, le demandeur a de nouveau été arrêté après avoir été trouvé en possession d'une brochure du parti Yekiti. Il a été interrogé et il a fait l'objet d'insultes et de sévices. Son frère a obtenu sa libération le 26 février 2009, en versant un pot-de-vin. On a remis le demandeur en liberté, à la condition qu'il se présente sur demande au Mukhabarat et qu'il l'informe de tout changement d'adresse.
[14]
Le demandeur craignait de se présenter au Mukhabarat, parce qu'il avait entendu parler de personnes qui, dans une situation semblable, avaient été mises en prison pendant plusieurs années. Pour passer le plus possible inaperçu, le demandeur a déménagé et a commencé à travailler dans une ferme. Après quelques mois, des agents du Mukhabarat qui étaient à sa recherche se sont présentés chez lui. Ils voulaient apparemment qu'il signe un document et prenne ainsi acte d'une date prochaine de comparution. Lorsqu'il a été mis au courant de leur visite, le demandeur a décidé de quitter la Syrie.
[15]
Le demandeur a fui son pays avec l'aide d'un passeur, le 17 mai 2010, à destination de la Grèce. En raison de ce qu'il avait vécu auparavant en Grèce, le demandeur a préféré partir pour le Canada, où il est arrivé le 24 juin 2010.

IV. Questions en litige et norme de contrôle
A. Questions en litige
1. Y a-t-il eu manquement à l'équité procédurale en raison des problèmes d'interprétation à l'audience?
2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a tiré sa conclusion quant à la crédibilité?
3. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en appréciant la preuve documentaire objective?
B. Norme de contrôle
[17]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], le juge Martineau a statué comme suit (au paragraphe 7): « Mais encore faut-il, en premier lieu, que le demandeur d'asile ait été entendu, et que son récit ait été compris par le tribunal. La qualité même de la traduction devant le tribunal peut donc soulever une question d'équité procédurale, et c'est la norme de contrôle de la décision correcte qui s'applique en pareil cas ».
[18]
La norme de contrôle applicable aux conclusions de la Commission quant à la crédibilité est celle de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
V. Argumentation des parties
A. Arguments du demandeur
[20]
Le demandeur soutient que de graves lacunes dans la qualité de l'interprétation à l'audience ont porté atteinte à son droit à l'équité procédurale.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], la Cour d'appel fédérale a statué que les demandeurs d'asile qui comparaissent devant la Commission ont droit à une interprétation « continue, fidèle, compétente, impartiale et concomitante » et qu'ils n'ont pas à établir qu'ils ont subi un préjudice pour démontrer la violation de ce droit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 4). La Cour a toutefois conclu comme suit dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Aussi important que puisse être ce droit, le fardeau reposant sur la personne qui soulève un problème d'interprétation est lourd. Une telle allégation doit être suffisante pour réfuter la présomption selon laquelle l'interprète, qui a prêté serment de fournir une interprétation fidèle, a agi contrairement à son serment. La simple allégation d'une erreur d'interprétation n'est pas suffisante, car le fardeau consiste à prouver, selon la balance des probabilités, qu'il y a eu erreur d'interprétation.
[21]
Le demandeur fait remarquer que lui-même et M. Huseyin Sertkaya (un interprète agréé de la Commission dans les langues kurde et turque) ont fourni des affidavits qui font état de graves erreurs ou lacunes dans l'interprétation offerte à l'audience.
[22]
Bien que le demandeur fasse valoir qu'il n'a pas à démontrer que l'interprétation déficiente lui a causé préjudice, il soutient aussi en avoir subi un en l'espèce. Il souligne que la Commission a tiré les conclusions défavorables quant à sa crédibilité parce qu'elle a jugé ses réponses « évasives » et « non pertinentes » et son témoignage « médiocre », et parce qu'il a fallu lui poser plusieurs fois la même question avant d'obtenir une réponse. Or, tous ces problèmes résultent selon lui de la mauvaise qualité de l'interprétation. Le demandeur soutient que la piètre qualité de l'interprétation lui a causé un important préjudice étant donné que la décision de la Commission se fonde uniquement sur la crédibilité.
[23]
Le demandeur reconnaît que dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la Cour d'appel fédérale a statué qu'un demandeur sera jugé avoir renoncé à son droit à une interprétation compétente s'il n'a pas mis en question la qualité de l'interprétation dès qu'il pouvait le faire au cours de l'audience. Au paragraphe 18 de l'arrêt, la Cour d'appel déclare ce qui suit:
Comme le juge Pelletier l'a fait remarquer, si l'argument invoqué par l'appelant est exact, l'intéressé qui a des problèmes en ce qui concerne la qualité de l'interprétation fournie à l'audience ne pourrait rien faire pendant toute la durée de l'audience, mais il pourrait néanmoins contester avec succès la décision à une date ultérieure. De fait, lorsque l'intéressé décide de ne rien faire même si la qualité de l'interprétation le préoccupe, la section du statut n'est pas en mesure de savoir que l'interprétation comporte des lacunes à certains égards. L'intéressé est toujours celui qui est le mieux placé pour savoir si l'interprétation est exacte et pour faire savoir à la section du statut, au cours de l'audience, que la question de l'exactitude le préoccupe,
à moins que des circonstances exceptionnelles ne l'empêchent de le faire
. [Souligné par le demandeur.]
[24]
En l'espèce, l'avocat du demandeur s'est opposé avant l'audience au recours à l'interprète désigné, parce qu'il avait connaissance de ses lacunes en anglais. Après avoir tenté sans succès de trouver un autre interprète, la Commission a indiqué que l'interprète désigné était un interprète agréé, et qu'elle procéderait à l'audition avec lui.
[25]
Comme il a une connaissance restreinte de l'anglais, le demandeur n'a pas été en mesure de déterminer si l'interprète traduisait son témoignage de manière continue, fidèle, compétente, impartiale et concomitante. Il ne s'est rendu compte de la piètre qualité de la traduction que lorsqu'il a examiné la décision de la formation qu'il a écouté l'enregistrement audio de l'audience. Bien qu'un ami du demandeur présent à titre d'observateur ait informé son avocat qu'il avait relevé certaines erreurs, ce dernier lui a à ce moment indiqué qu'il ne pouvait rien faire étant donné qu'il avait manifesté son opposition avant l'audience, et qu'on lui avait répondu que l'interprète était un interprète agréé et qu'on procéderait à l'audience avec lui. Le demandeur soutient que, comme il n'avait pas conscience de la gravité des erreurs d'interprétation et que son avocat s'était opposé avant que ne débute l'audience, la Cour ne devrait pas conclure qu'il a renoncé à son droit de mettre en question la qualité de l'interprétation.
[26]
Le demandeur prétend ensuite que la Commission a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a tiré sa conclusion quant à la crédibilité. La Commission a tiré une inférence négative du défaut du demandeur de mentionner, dans le récit contenu dans son FRP, qu'il avait reçu des soins médicaux pour les blessures subies pendant sa troisième détention. Le demandeur soutient que la production après l'audience d'un billet du médecin à l'appui de son allégation de mauvais traitements justifie d'écarter la conclusion défavorable de la Commission.
[27]
Le Dr Jamal Al Hussein a rédigé le billet en question. Il déclare que le demandeur avait [traduction] « des marques de torture sur le corps et des traces sur la peau ». Selon le demandeur, la décision de la Commission d'accorder peu de poids au billet et de tirer une inférence négative du défaut de mentionner la visite médicale dans le FRP était déraisonnable étant donné que la Commission n'a pas mis en question l'authenticité du billet. Ce billet, ajoute-t-il, est un document corroborant qui étaye sa prétention de mauvais traitements aux mains des autorités syriennes.
[28]
En ce qui concerne la conclusion défavorable tirée par la Commission quant à sa crédibilité du fait qu'il n'a pas mentionné au port d'entrée sa détention en 1995, le demandeur fait valoir que la Commission n'a pas tenu compte de l'argument de son avocat selon lequel cette omission n'est guère pertinente en ce qui concerne les craintes qu'il avait en 2010, puisque de sont les deux dernières détentions pendant l'année 2008 qui l'ont amené à craindre pour sa sécurité et à fuir la Syrie.
[29]
Le demandeur prétend en dernier lieu que la Commission a commis une erreur de droit en ne déterminant pas s'il avait établi l'existence des éléments subjectif et objectif du critère d'octroi du statut de réfugié, ce qu'elle aurait dû faire même si elle ne le jugeait pas crédible.
[30]
Le demandeur soutient qu'une conclusion de non-crédibilité n'est pas déterminante quant à savoir si un demandeur est ou non un réfugié au sens de la Convention. Ainsi, même si elle juge un demandeur non crédible, la Commission doit quand même déterminer au vu de la preuve documentaire objective présentée si ce dernier a établi l'existence des éléments subjectif ou objectif de la définition de réfugié au sens de la Convention.
[31]
Selon la preuve présentée à la Commission en l'espèce, les deux frères du demandeur ont rallié les peshmergas kurdes pour défendre les Kurdes et le Kurdistan. De plus, il a été établi que, si sa demande devait être rejetée et qu'il était renvoyé en Syrie, le demandeur retournerait dans ce pays en tant que demandeur d'asile débouté.
[32]
Bien que la Commission ait examiné la possibilité que le demandeur coure un risque en raison de son origine ethnique kurde, elle n'a pas déterminé si la preuve documentaire objective démontrait qu'il courrait un risque en Syrie en raison de son appartenance à certains groupes sociaux, soit sa famille et les demandeurs d'asile déboutés.
[33]
La preuve documentaire présentée à la Commission montre qu'en Syrie les membres de la famille de Kurdes engagés politiquement sont susceptibles d'être interrogés, harcelés, détenus, soumis à des pressions et intimidés par les autorités syriennes. De plus, selon la preuve, les demandeurs d'asile déboutés risquent d'être détenus et d'être soumis à des interrogatoires et d'être torturés, advenant leur retour en Syrie. La Commission aurait dû prendre en compte cette preuve dans son évaluation de la demande d'asile du demandeur. En omettant de le faire, la Commission a commis une erreur de droit.
B. Arguments du défendeur
[34]
Avant de répondre aux arguments du demandeur, le défendeur a résumé comme suit les éléments sur lesquels la Commission a fondé ses conclusions quant à la crédibilité:
[traduction]
a) Dans son FRP et lorsqu'il a témoigné de vive voix, le demandeur a soutenu qu'en 1995, à l'âge de 14 ans, il avait été détenu et qu'on lui avait infligé des sévices pendant trois mois. Il n'a toutefois pas été en mesure de corroborer cette allégation par une preuve documentaire. La Commission a aussi relevé que le demandeur n'avait pas mentionné cette détention en réponse à la question 37 du formulaire IMM 5611. Le demandeur n'a pas pu expliquer adéquatement cette omission.
b) Le demandeur a prétendu qu'en 2005, il s'était enfui de la Syrie et qu'il avait demandé l'asile en Grèce. Il est probable qu'on ne lui ait pas reconnu le statut de réfugié en Grèce, mais on ne lui a pas demandé de quitter ce pays. Malgré cela, le demandeur est retourné volontairement en Syrie, en se soustrayant aux contrôles frontaliers parce qu'il estimait toujours périlleux de se trouver dans ce pays. Le demandeur n'a toutefois pu expliquer convenablement pourquoi il était retourné volontairement dans un pays où, prétendument, on l'avait détenu et violenté pendant trois mois.
c) Le demandeur n'a aucunement corroboré par une preuve documentaire le fait qu'il aurait fait des dons au parti Yekiti, et qu'il aurait été détenu en 2008.
d) Le demandeur a déclaré dans sa déposition qu'il avait fait soigner des blessures prétendument subies lors de ses détentions en 2008. Toutefois, la Commission a souligné que le demandeur n'avait pas mentionné avoir consulté un médecin dans son FRP comme il devait le faire pour répondre à la question 31.
e) Le demandeur a modifié à l'audience le paragraphe 15 de son FRP, et déclaré que sa dernière prétendue détention en Syrie s'était déroulée du 24 décembre 2008 jusqu'au 26 février 2009, plutôt que jusqu'au 24 janvier 2009. La Commission a fait remarquer que cette modification faisait doubler la durée de la prétendue détention, et faisait rétroactivement concorder le récit du demandeur avec la réponse qu'il avait donnée dans le formulaire IMM5611. Le demandeur a affirmé que l'erreur avait résulté d'une traduction déficiente, mais la Commission n'a pas jugé cette explication satisfaisante. (Exposé complémentaire des arguments du défendeur, aux pages 3 et 4)
[35]
Pour ce qui est de la première question en litige, le défendeur soutient que les erreurs d'interprétation commises à l'audience n'ont pas eu d'incidence sur la décision de la Commission et qu'en conséquence, il n'y a pas lieu que la Cour intervienne. Il cite à cet égard le passage suivant de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 30:
J'ai examiné chacune des erreurs alléguées et les défauts de traduction et je suis d'avis que ces erreurs et défauts n'ont eu aucune incidence sur la compréhension des témoignages par la Commission ou sur le fondement de ses conclusions précises quant à la crédibilité. Étant donné que les erreurs n'étaient pas pertinentes quant à la conclusion finale, la Cour ne doit pas intervenir:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[36]
Selon le défendeur, même si le demandeur démontrait que les erreurs commises ont eu une incidence sur la décision de la Commission, il n'en demeure pas moins qu'il a renoncé à son droit de soulever la question devant la Cour en ne mettant pas en cause la qualité de l'interprétation dès qu'il pouvait le faire au cours de l'audience.
[37]
Quant au fait, invoqué par le demandeur, que son ancien avocat s'est opposé au recours à l'interprète avant le début de l'audience, le défendeur soutient que cette objection ne permet pas de satisfaire au critère selon lequel il faut s'opposer à la première occasion à la mauvaise qualité de l'interprétation. On doit nécessairement exprimer une telle opposition
pendant
l'audience (c.-à-d. lorsque sont véritablement, et non seulement théoriquement, commises les erreurs d'interprétation).
[38]
Par ailleurs, le défendeur estime sans fondement l'argument du demandeur selon lequel son obligation de faire opposition pendant l'audience s'était éteinte en raison de l'avis contraire donné par son ancien avocat. Premièrement, si l'ancien avocat a été informé à l'audience de la mauvaise qualité de l'interprétation, il avait l'obligation déontologique de s'opposer, peu importe ce qui avait pu être discuté avant l'audience. Deuxièmement, si le demandeur veut dire qu'il se serait opposé n'eût été le conseil reçu, il fait en réalité valoir que l'incompétence de son ancien avocat a porté atteinte à son droit à l'équité procédurale.
[39]
Le défendeur relève que la Cour a déjà déclaré qu' « [u]n justiciable ne peut valablement invoquer une faute professionnelle de son ancien avocat sans fournir les explications de ce dernier sur ce qui lui est reproché ou sans une preuve que l'affaire a été soumise pour enquête au barreau, auquel l'avocat est inscrit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Selon le défendeur, rien dans la preuve n'indique que le demandeur a fait quoi que ce soit en ce sens. Le défendeur en conclut que le demandeur ne peut pas faire valoir l'incompétence de son avocat, et qu'il a aussi renoncé à son droit d'invoquer la piètre qualité de l'interprétation en ne s'y opposant pas à la première occasion.
[40]
Quant à l'argument du demandeur selon lequel il était déraisonnable pour la Commission de tirer une inférence négative du fait que dans son FRP il n'avait pas mentionné les soins médicaux reçus après sa dernière détention, le défendeur insiste pour dire qu'une telle inférence appartient aux issues possibles.
[41]
L'inférence négative était raisonnable, selon le défendeur, compte tenu du fait 1) qu'on donnait en ce qui concerne la question 31 du FRP les instructions suivantes: « Indiquez si vous avez reçu, au Canada ou ailleurs, des soins ou évaluations d'ordre médical ou psychologique liés à cette demande », et 2) que lorsque la Commission a demandé au demandeur d'expliquer à l'audience son omission, celui-ci a répondu qu'il avait [traduction] « simplement écrit ce qui était arrivé en prison » une explication insuffisante au vu des instructions précises données dans le FRP.
[42]
Quant à la troisième question en litige, le défendeur soutient que la prétention du demandeur, selon laquelle la Commission n'a pas évalué convenablement s'il allait courir un risque en Syrie en raison des liens de sa famille avec des militants kurdes, est sans fondement pour deux motifs. Premièrement, on ne peut pas dire que la Commission n'a pas évalué ce risque alors qu'au paragraphe 39 de ses motifs elle a déclaré qu'elle avait « rejeté les allégations du demandeur d'asile selon lesquelles il serait pris pour cible en raison des liens qu'il entretient avec sa famille, qui comprendrait des militants et des combattants kurdes ». Deuxièmement, le demandeur a lui-même reconnu que sa preuve montrait uniquement que ses frères avaient [traduction] «
présumément
rallié les peshmergas »; par conséquent, le demandeur ne peut soutenir qu'il a établi le risque que courrait sa famille, et ne peut donc pas extrapoler l'existence d'un tel risque pour lui-même.
[43]
Enfin, le défendeur estime aussi sans fondement l'argument du demandeur selon lequel la Commission a commis une erreur en n'évaluant pas le risque auquel il serait exposé en tant que demandeur d'asile débouté. En effet, ce point n'a pas été soulevé dans son FRP et dans ses observations postérieures à l'audience. Lorsqu'un demandeur d'asile n'allègue pas l'existence d'un risque, la Commission n'est pas tenue de scruter la preuve documentaire afin d'y déceler, pour le compte du demandeur, des facteurs de risque. Le défendeur cite le passage suivant de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au soutien de cet argument:
[traduction]
[14] Le demandeur soutient que la Cour fédérale a établi par une « jurisprudence constante » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CF 773;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1re inst.)) qu'une fois que la Commission a conclu que le demandeur d'asile est celui qu'il prétend être, elle avait l'obligation d'examiner en détail la preuve objective sur la situation dans le pays, malgré toute conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité qu'elle aurait pu tirer. La Commission ayant admis qu'il était d'origine rom, le demandeur affirme qu'elle a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte de la preuve relative à la situation dans le pays.
[15] Il convient toutefois de rejeter l'argument du demandeur étant donné que, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour d'appel fédérale a déclaré ce qui suit, en réponse à une question certifiée:
[...] Lorsque la Commission tire une conclusion générale selon laquelle le demandeur manque de crédibilité, cette conclusion suffit pour rejeter la demande, à moins que le dossier ne comporte une preuve documentaire indépendante et crédible permettant d'étayer une décision favorable au demandeur. C'est au demandeur qu'il incombe de démontrer que cette preuve existe.
[16] Le demandeur n'a pas présenté à la Commission une « preuve documentaire indépendante et crédible » et, comme c'est à lui qu'il incombait de le faire, la Commission n'avait pas l'obligation d'examiner en détail la preuve sur la situation dans le pays.
VI. Analyse
1. Y a-t-il eu manquement à l'équité procédurale en raison des problèmes d'interprétation à l'audience?
[44]
Il convient tout d'abord de déterminer si le demandeur doit démontrer que les lacunes dans l'interprétation ont influé directement sur la décision de la Commission. Le demandeur s'appuie sur l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, pour soutenir qu'il n'y est pas tenu. Le défendeur invoque pour sa part la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> de la Cour, précitée, pour affirmer le contraire.
[45]
S'il n'a pas à établir l'existence d'un préjudice pour prouver qu'une interprétation déficiente a occasionné un manquement à l'équité procédurale (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité), le demandeur
est
tenu de démontrer, pour que la Cour intervienne, que le manquement a eu une incidence sur la décision de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 52 et 53).
[46]
Le demandeur soutient que les problèmes d'interprétation à l'audience ont eu une incidence sur la décision de la Commission. Il fait valoir plus particulièrement que la Commission, en tirant sa conclusion déterminante quant à la crédibilité, s'est appuyée sur le fait que ses réponses étaient « évasives » et « non pertinentes » et son témoignage « médiocre », et que cette situation résultait à son tour d'une interprétation lacunaire.
[47]
La Cour ne partage pas cet avis. La Commission mentionne expressément et plus d'une fois dans sa décision qu'elle ne va pas tirer une inférence négative quant à la crédibilité en raison du témoignage médiocre ou des réponses non pertinentes du demandeur (voir les paragraphes 15 à 33 des motifs). La conclusion défavorable de la Commission en la matière découle en grande partie du défaut du demandeur de produire des éléments de preuve corroborants (voir les paragraphes 18, 20 et 29) et du fait qu'il a omis dans son FRP des parties importantes de son récit (voir les paragraphes 23, 27, 30 et 31). Le demandeur n'a donc pas démontré que les erreurs de l'interprète ont joué un rôle important dans la conclusion déterminante de la Commission quant à la crédibilité.
[48]
Comme la Cour conclut que la qualité de la traduction n'a pas eu d'effet déterminant en l'espèce, la question de savoir si le demandeur a renoncé à son droit de la mettre en cause devient purement théorique. Il importe toutefois de souligner que, pour protéger adéquatement le droit de son client de soulever la question de la traduction lacunaire, l'ancien avocat du demandeur aurait dû insister, à tout le moins, pour que l'objection soulevée à l'égard des compétences de l'interprète avant l'audience soit consignée au dossier au début de celle-ci.
2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a tiré sa conclusion quant à la crédibilité?
[49]
La Commission a rejeté la demande d'asile du demandeur en raison de sa conclusion défavorable quant à sa crédibilité. Le demandeur soutient que la Commission a tiré des inférences négatives en matière de crédibilité par suite de son défaut de mentionner dans le FRP qu'il avait consulté un médecin après ses détentions en 2008 et 2009, et que cela était déraisonnable. Après l'audience devant la Commission, le demandeur a produit un billet du médecin qui l'avait soigné, le Dr Jamal Al Hussein. Cet élément de preuve corroborait le récit de sa détention et de ses mauvais traitements aux mains des autorités syriennes. Le demandeur affirme que la Commission a agi de manière déraisonnable en accordant moins de poids au billet qu'elle ne l'aurait normalement fait tout simplement parce qu'il avait mal expliqué son défaut de mentionner la consultation dans son FRP. L'échange pertinent était le suivant:
[traduction]
PRÉSIDENT DE L'AUDIENCE Je vous remercie. Monsieur, pourquoi n'avez-vous pas mentionné ces soins médicaux dans votre récit, comme cela était demandé dans les directives jointes?
DEMANDEUR D'ASILE - J'ai simplement écrit ce qui m'était arrivé en prison, comment j'étais, vous savez.
(Transcription de l'audience, page 289 du dossier du demandeur)
[50]
Les deux parties reconnaissent que la Commission n'a pas mis en question l'authenticité du billet du médecin. Le défendeur soutient qu'il était raisonnable pour la Commission d'attribuer un poids moindre au billet en raison du défaut du demandeur de mentionner la consultation, et de l'explication non pertinente qu'il en a donnée. La Cour n'est pas de cet avis. Bien que le billet ne constitue pas
en soi
une preuve concluante de la véracité du récit du demandeur (c.-à-d. que les autorités syriennes l'ont détenu et lui ont fait subir des mauvais traitements en 2008 et en 2009), il s'agit néanmoins d'un important élément de preuve corroborant. On n'aurait pas dû en diminuer l'importance pour des motifs non déterminants.
[51]
Comme l'authenticité du billet n'a pas été mise en question, le défaut du demandeur de mentionner la consultation dans son FRP, ou d'expliquer de manière satisfaisante cette omission, n'aurait pas dû influer sur le poids à lui accorder. La Cour conclut que c'est de façon arbitraire, et donc déraisonnable, que la Commission a accordé un poids insuffisant à cet élément de preuve. Bien que la Commission ait fait état d'autres problèmes de crédibilité, il est impossible pour la Cour d'établir quelle aurait été l'issue de la cause si la Commission avait convenablement tenu compte du billet du médecin. La juge Dawson a formulé à cet égard, dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  les explications suivantes (au paragraphe 9):
[9] J'ai examiné les observations du ministre, qui prétend que la décision de la Commission ne devrait pas être annulée vu ses autres conclusions quant à la crédibilité. Cependant, je ne suis pas disposée à me livrer à des conjectures sur l'issue qu'aurait eue la cause si la Commission n'avait pas commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle au sujet de l'élément essentiel de la demande de M. Khan.
[52]
La Commission a commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle en accordant peu de poids, sans justification raisonnable, à un important élément de preuve corroborant qui touchait au cœur même de la demande d'asile du demandeur. Pour ce motif, la présente demande est accueillie, la décision du 28 juin 2012 de la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié est annulée et l'affaire est renvoyée à une formation différemment constituée de la Section de la protection des réfugiés pour nouvelle décision.
[53]
Compte tenu de la conclusion de la Cour relativement à la deuxième question en litige, il n'est pas nécessaire d'examiner les autres questions soulevées par le demandeur.

 Noël, J. 
 : This is an application for judicial review pursuant to s. 18.1 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  of the decision of an adjudicator ("the adjudicator") appointed under Division XIV - Part III of the  
 Canada Labour Code 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2 (the " 
 Code 
 ") in the matter of a complaint of alleged unjust dismissal brought by Alma Jean Guimond ("the respondent") against The Sagkeeng Education Authority ("the applicant").  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  A summary of the facts relevant to this application for judicial review are found in the Adjudicator's decision (In the matter of an Adjucication pursuant to Division XIV, Part III of The  
 Canada Labour Code 
 :  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The complainant is a school teacher who acquired her Bachelor of Teaching degree from Brandon University in October of 1978. She originally entered into a one-year contract of employment with the Fort Alexander Band School Board on behalf of the respondent for the 1978-1979 school year. Similar contracts were entered for the subsequent two school years. Then as of September 1, 1981 the complainant entered a contract with the Fort Alexander School Board on behalf of the respondent whereby it agreed to employ her as a 'permanent' teacher. The contract had no predetermined date of expiration but did include the following provisions regarding term:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 'III. The Teacher will be given one full year's written notice by the Board on or before August 31 of the last year of service if cause for termination of employment should arise.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 'X. This Agreement may be terminated  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) at any time by the mutual consent in writing of the Teacher and the Board; or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) on the 31st of August of any year by either party giving written notice to the other on or before the 1st of September of the preceding year; or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) if any matter arises, whereby the Teacher is guilty of a grossly immoral, delinquent, or illegal act, or gross dereliction of duty, and the Teacher having recourse to section (d) below, the Board may give the Teacher 30 days written notice of termination, and the contract is terminated at the expiration of the 30 days from the date the notice is given.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) In the event of any disagreement between the Teacher and the Board, the above consent to arbitration by a committee comprising  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 three persons chosen by the Board,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 three persons chosen by the Teacher, and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 one person with arbitration experience and belonging to a professional organization. The selection of this person shall be mutually agreed upon by the Teacher and the Board.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Such proceedings will constitute an "Appeal by the Teacher".'  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In 1981, a group of school teachers employed by the Band sought to unionize under the auspices of the Manitoba Teacher's Society. Their efforts failed and ultimately four teachers were dismissed. The teachers instituted legal proceedings against the respondent alleging wrongful dismissal and ultimately they were awarded damages.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The Board then implemented a change of its employment practice. Teachers were thereafter required to sign annual contracts with the respondent and the school board, notwithstanding the fact that teachers such as the complainant had previously entered permanent teaching contracts. The complainant entered such annual contracts each year from that time until 1993 when she was refused a new contract and ultimately these proceedings arose. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [3] 
  In March 1993, Ms. Karen Courchene, the principal of Anicinabe School, conducted an evaluation of the complainant. The evaluation detailed various criticisms, including that the complainant lacked enthusiasm, and recommended that the complainant improve both her spoken and written grammar and her grasp of core subjects, especially English language arts. The complainant wrote a letter to the Director of Education for the Band, Mr. Patrick Bruyere, outlining her concerns with respect to the evaluation. This letter was reviewed by the School Board in consultation with Ms. Courchene. By letter dated April 16, 1993, Mr. Bruyere informed the complainant that the following decisions had been taken in her regard:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 -	She was to be given the opportunity to obtain her Bachelor of Education degree.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 -	As a result, the Board would not be offering her a teaching contract for the following school year.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 -	Upon successful completion of the Bachelor of Education degree, a teaching position would be available to her.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The complainant did not take advantage of this offer. She was paid until August 1993 and was not rehired for the subsequent school year. Ms. Guimond then brought a complaint of unjust dismissal against her employer, and sought reinstatement, compensation akin to damages in an amount equal to her salary for the 1993-1994 school year, costs and interest. The employer raised the following objections:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 i.	The adjudicator did not have jurisdiction to consider the complaint because there had been no dismissal of the complainant by the employer, as required by s. 240(1) of the  
 Canada Labour Code 
 . The employer alleged that the complainant had effectively resigned when she did not take up the employer's offer to upgrade her education and instead asked for a letter of recommendation. Furthermore, according to the employer, the failure to renew the complainant's contract for an additional year did not constitute a dismissal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 ii.	The adjudicator did not have jurisdiction to consider the complaint because the complainant had been laid off due to a lack of work or the discontinuance of a function, as contemplated by s. 242(3.1)(a) of the  
 Canada Labour Code 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 iii.	Alternatively, the dismissal was not unjust. The employer's requirement that employees have a Bachelor of Education was reasonable and its decision not to renew the complainant's contract was thus justified.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  The adjudicator held in favour of Ms. Guimond on all three grounds and ordered the employer to pay the complainant an amount equal to her salary for the 1993-1994 school year. The applicant now applies to set aside the adjudicator's decision. The principal ground is that the adjudicator acted without jurisdiction in concluding that the respondent Alma Jean Guimond had been dismissed from her employment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Statutory Provisions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  The relevant statutory provisions are set out below:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "240(1) Subject to subss. (2) and 242(3.1), any person  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) who has completed 12 consecutive months of continuous employment by an employer, and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) who is not a member of a group of employees subject to a collective agreement,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 may make a complaint in writing to an inspector if the employee has been dismissed and considers the dismissal to be unjust.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "242(1) The Minister may, on receipt of a report pursuant to subs. 241(3), appoint any person that the Minister considers appropriate as an adjudicator to hear and adjudicate on the complaint in respect of which the report was made, and refer the complaint to the adjudicator along with any statement provided pursuant to subs. 241(1).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(2) An adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subs. (1)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) shall consider the complaint within such time as the Governor-in-Council may by regulation prescribe;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) shall determine the procedure to be followed, but shall give full opportunity to the parties to the complaint to present evidence and make submissions to the adjudicator and shall consider the information relating to the complaint; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) has, in relation to any complaint before the adjudicator, the powers conferred on the Canada Labour Relations Board, in relation to any proceeding before the Board, under paragraphs 16(a), (b) and (c).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(3) Subject to subs. (3.1), an adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subs. (1) shall  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) consider whether the dismissal of the person who made the complaint was unjust and render a decision thereon; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) send a copy of the decision with the reasons therefor to each party to the complaint and to the Minister.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (...)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "(4) Where an adjudicator decides pursuant to subs. (3) that a person has been unjustly dismissed, the adjudicator may, by order, require the employer who dismissed the person to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) pay the person compensation not exceeding the amount of money that is equivalent to the remuneration that would, but for the dismissal, have been paid by the employer to the person;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) reinstate the person in his employ; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) do any other like thing that it is equitable to require the employer to do in order to remedy or counteract any consequence of the dismissal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "243(1) Every order of an adjudicator appointed under subs. 242(1) is final and shall not be questioned or reviewed in any court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (2) No order shall be made, process entered or proceeding taken in any court, whether by way of injunction, certiorari, prohibition, quo warranto or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit, or restrain an adjudicator in any proceedings of the adjudicator under s. 242. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 The Applicable Standard Of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  In the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 U.E.S., Local 298 v. Bibeault 
 , [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1048; 95 N.R. 161; 24 Q.A.C. 244, at p. 1086 S.C.R. [hereinafter  
 Bibeault 
 ], Beetz, J., set out the two circumstances in which an administrative tribunal would exceed its jurisdiction because of error:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1.	if the question of law at issue is within the tribunal's jurisdiction, it will only exceed its jurisdiction if it errs in a patently unreasonable manner; a tribunal which is competent to answer a question may make errors in so doing without being subject to judicial review;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2.	if however the question at issue concerns a legislative provision limiting the tribunal's powers, a mere error will cause it to lose jurisdiction and subject the tribunal to judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  The first stage in the pragmatic or functional analysis proposed by the Supreme Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  is to determine the tribunal's jurisdiction. This involves asking the question: "Did the legislator intend the question to be within the jurisdiction conferred on the tribunal?"  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 1087 S.C.R. In determining jurisdiction, the court examines "not only the wording of the enactment conferring jurisdiction on the administrative tribunal, but the purpose of the statute creating the tribunal, the reason for its existence, the area of expertise of its members and the nature of the problem before the tribunal." ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 1088 S.C.R.).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [hereinafter  
 Pollard 
 ], the Federal Court of Appeal applied the functional analysis proposed  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  to decide whether or not Parliament had intended the question of the interpretation of ss. 240(1)(b) and 242(3.1)(b) of the  
 Canada Labour Code 
  to be within the jurisdiction conferred on an Adjudicator appointed under Part III of the  
 Code 
 . After considering the ad hoc basis of the appointment of the adjudicators under the  
 Code 
 , the limited scope of their powers, as well as the statutory language limiting their jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal concluded that it was unable to find a legislative intent to entrust the adjudicator with the jurisdiction to interpret "virtually unchecked" ss. 240(1)(b) and 242(3.1)(b) of the  
 Code 
 . The Court of Appeal held that the appropriate test for judicial review was that of correctness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 185 N.R. 107, the Federal Court of Appeal reiterated that the standard of review of the interpretation by an adjudicator of ss. 242(3.1)(a) and 242(3.1)(b) was that of correctness.

 [9] 
  An essential precondition to an adjudicator's jurisdiction to consider a complaint of unjust dismissal under s. 240(1) of the  
 Canada Labour Code 
  is for the complainant to establish that he or she has been dismissed. The Federal Court of Appeal, in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at p. 247, reviewed the meaning of "dismissal" and its significance as a precondition to the adjudicator's jurisdiction:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The dismissal is the implementation by the employer of his intention to unilaterally terminate the contract of employment binding him to his employee. This implementation may occur in various ways and there is no basis for thinking that in s. 61.5 [now ss. 240-246] the legislator intended to cover only one of them, even if that one was the most simple, direct or usual. Of course, the adjudicator must have before him a dismissal, that is to say, the employer's actions must disclose a definite intention to unilaterally terminate the contract of employment (and that is all that was at the basis of the decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  School Board 
 , supra),  
 but once this is established there is in our opinion no question as to his jurisdiction 
 ." (Emphasis mine).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The determination of whether the respondent was dismissed by the applicant is thus a precondition to the adjudicator's jurisdiction. According to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  and the jurisprudence reviewed above, the standard of judicial review on a jurisdictional question such as the interpretation of s. 240(1) is one of correctness. Although the decision of an adjudicator appointed under the  
 Canada Labour Code 
  is protected by a finality clause, it is well-established that the requirement that an administrative tribunal be correct in its interpretation of a jurisdiction-conferring statutory provision nevertheless applies. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 437; 89 C.L.L.C. 14,050; [1989] 6 W.W.R. 673; 40 Admin. L.R. 181, at p. 1003 S.C.R. per La Forest, J.: "Where, as here, an administrative tribunal is protected by a privative clause, this Court has indicated that it will only review the decision of the Board if that Board has either made an error in interpreting the provisions conferring jurisdiction on it, or has exceeded its jurisdiction by making a patently unreasonable error of law in the performance of its function (...)"; see also  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 454 F.C. (T.D.), and  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Was The Respondent Dismissed?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  As recognized by the adjudicator, the answer to the question as to whether the respondent was dismissed or not depends on the validity of the annual contracts which she signed over the years since 1983. If these annual contracts, and in particular the last one, were found to be valid, then the employer's decision not to offer the complainant a position for the 1993-1994 school year was made in conformity with the terms of the contract and does not constitute a dismissal. Hence, the adjudicator would have been without jurisdiction to hear the complaint.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  The adjudicator held that by requiring the complainant to sign an annual contract in 1983 despite having offered her a "permanent" teaching contract in 1981, the applicant arbitrarily altered the employment relationship "under the guise of termination of a contract and replacement". The adjudicator found that a refusal to sign the annual contracts would have invited termination, jeopardized the complainant's career and caused hardship to herself and her family. He added that the inequality of bargaining power in favour of the employer made the employer's unilateral alteration of the employment relationship "unconscionable". Relying on the established body of case law relating to unilaterally imposed policy changes, the Adjudicator went on to conclude that (Adjudicator's Decision, at p. 13):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In my view, whether an employment policy is arbitrarily imposed or an employment relationship is arbitrarily altered under the guise of termination of a contract and replacement, the principles applied should be no different. Both are unconscionable and must not prevail. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [12] 
  The adjudicator based this conclusion on the Manitoba Court of Appeal's decision in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.). In  
 Wiebe 
 , the court considered whether the breach by a long-time employee of an employment policy implemented after he had commenced employment could warrant his termination. Relying on established jurisprudence in this area, the Court of Appeal held it did not on the basis that the employee had not agreed to the change in policy. Specifically, it held that the inequality of the bargaining position of the employer and the employee placed a heavy onus on the employer to establish that the plaintiff had agreed to the policy, and that this onus had not been met.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeal reviewed the case law regarding the imposition of employment policies on employees.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the defendant employer under a contract which fixed his remuneration by reference to a stipulated rate of commission on net sales. The contract, which provided for an indefinite employment terminable on two weeks' notice, also contained a restrictive covenant (applicable for one year following termination) in respect of the area of employment. The employer subsequently began to withhold 10% of commissions earned by the plaintiff and other salesmen as a reserve for bad debts. The plaintiff complained periodically about these deductions, but remained in the defendant's employ for a year after they began. The plaintiff then sued to recover the withheld commissions. The Ontario Court of Appeal, per Mackay, J.A., at pp. 131-132 held that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "... it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that an employee accepts an attempted variation simply by the fact alone of continuing in his employment.  
 Where an employer attempts to vary the contractual terms, the position of the employee is this: He may accept the variation expressly or impliedly in which case there is a new contract. 
  He may refuse to accept it and if the employer persists in the attempted variation the employee may treat this persistence as a breach of contract and sue the employer for damages, or while refusing to accept it he may continue in his employment and if the employer permits him to discharge his obligations and the employee makes it plain that he is not accepting the variation, then the employee is entitled to insist on the original terms." (Emphasis mine)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  also reviewed the decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In  
 Pronovost 
 , the plaintiff employee was dismissed summarily and given only two weeks' severance pay. The employer relied on a provision in its company personnel manual, known to the plaintiff, which stated that it was not company policy to pay severance pay. The employer's position was that once the employee had become aware of the policy, he must be taken to have agreed to it when he continued in the same employment despite the change. In dismissing the employer's arguments and deciding that the plaintiff was entitled to reasonable notice or salary in lieu of notice, the court stated, at p. 283:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "I just cannot accept that unrealistic position. To object to the policy would be to invite termination. I repeat what I said in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.), Vancouver No. C820989, 18th November 1982 (not yet reported):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 'It is the position of counsel for the defendants that the plaintiff is bound by the policy outlined in the handbook. I cannot agree with that proposition and that would be so even if the plaintiff had read and understood the pertinent section of the handbook when received in 1978-79.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 ' 
 In the absence of a contractual arrangement 
 , the plaintiff was entitled at common law to reasonable notice or salary in lieu of notice. The employer cannot unilaterally deprive him of that common law right.'" (Emphasis mine).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The last decision reviewed by the court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  was that of  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.L.R.(2d) 254 (S.C.) [hereinafter  
 Starcevich 
 , cited to C.C.E.L.]. The defendant employer argued that because the employee had been aware of the company policy regarding severance, and had even applied it to other employees, the policy had become a term of employment. The court dismissed this argument and held at p. 51:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "If the defendant is correct in saying that the 1987 severance policy became a term of the plaintiff's employment when it was promulgated, then, in my view, the defendant is saying that it had the right to unilaterally impose a new term of employment on the plaintiff long after the initial hiring. I know of no theory of contract law which suggests that one party can unilaterally impose a contractual term on the other  
 unless the other agrees to accept that term as a term of his or her contract 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In this case the defendant says that the plaintiff accepted the policy as a term of his employment. In support of that statement, the defendant points to the fact that the plaintiff was aware of the policy, and that he, in fact, applied the policy to others during the course of his employment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In my view, neither of those facts establishes, on balance, that the plaintiff accepted that policy as a term of his own contract of employment. The plaintiff may well have had to deal with the dismissal of employees as part of his job description, and if there was a policy in effect, no doubt he was required to apply that policy. It does not follow that by applying the policy he must be taken to have accepted that he was legally bound by the policy in the event of his own dismissal.  
 There would have to be clear and unequivocal evidence to establish that the plaintiff had agreed to the policy forming part of his own contract of employment 
 . Such clear and unequivocal evidence does not exist in the material before me." (Emphasis mine)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  The rule established by these decisions is therefore quite clear. An employment policy introduced by an employer does not become a term of the employment contract unless and until it has been clearly agreed to by the employee. Knowledge of the policy by an employee while he or she continues in the same employment without asserting any objection will not necessarily be construed as acquiescence particularly where a denunciation of the policy could invite termination. However, as is explicitly stated in each of the cases referred to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 , if there is clear and unequivocal acceptance of the policy as a term of employment, the policy is binding on the employee.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  How is this principle to be applied to the case at bar? In 1983, the applicant informed its employees that it would be requiring them to sign annual contracts with the school board, notwithstanding the fact that they had originally been engaged under contracts of an indeterminate duration. Clearly, this action on the part of the employer was an attempt to vary the contractual terms of employment. What then were the options open to the respondent? As noted by the Ontario Court of Appeal in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it was open to her to accept the variation in which case a new annual contract came into existence. It was also open to the respondent to refuse to accept the variation. If the employer persisted and refused to continue her employment for failure to abide by the unilaterally imposed term as the adjudicator envisaged, she could then have sought the appropriate remedy for unjust dismissal. This remedy would have been available whether the respondent had been terminated outright, or under the guise of a refusal to continue her employment for the subsequent school year. See  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  However, by signing the first annual contract and each one thereafter over a 10-year period, the respondent consented, in the clearest way possible, to the variation to the contract proposed by her employer. Assuming that this consent was validly given, a new employment contract, with a one-year duration, came into existence and replaced the preceding one. It is therefore apparent that this is not a case of an employee confronted by a unilaterally imposed policy change which has not been expressly accepted as  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 ,  
 Gorman 
 ,  
 Stacevich 
  or  
 Pronovost 
 . The annual contracts signed by the respondent year after year evidence her acceptance in the clearest way known to law and therefore bind her to the fullest extent. The Adjudicator therefore erred in failing to take note of this acceptance and in holding that the matter could be decided by reference to the principle developed in the aforementioned cases.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  If, on the other hand, the Adjudicator's decision can be read as holding that the respondent should nevertheless be relieved from her contract on the sole ground that her bargaining position was inferior to that of the employer, then it is entirely without legal foundation. (There was no suggestion on the part of the complainant that she should be relieved of her contract on any other ground, i.e., undue influence, duress, misrepresentation, fraud or non est factum, nor did the adjudicator make any finding in this regard.) Bargaining positions are rarely if ever equal in any given contractual relationship. In the context of employment contracts, the employer usually has the stronger bargaining power. That, as such, has never been held to be a ground for allowing an employee to repudiate the terms of a contract. The Adjudicator was obviously concerned by the fact that, in his view, a refusal by the respondent to accept the contractual modification in 1983 might have led to her termination. But even if that be so, she was entitled to reasonable notice and no one could have taken that right away from her if indeed she had decided to exercise it. Instead of exercising that right, she opted to accept the contractual modification. That is the choice that she made.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  I would add that in assessing whether there was anything "unconscionable" about the circumstances in which the respondent made that choice, as the adjudicator suggests there was, it must be remembered that there is no legal entitlement to permanent employment. An employer may terminate employment of an indeterminate duration at any time, just as an employee may quit such employment at any time, provided that in either case reasonable notice be given. In the same vein, an employer may attempt to change the fundamental terms of an employment contract, in which case an employee may accept or refuse to adhere to such changes. If the employee does refuse, the employer cannot compel acceptance. However, the employer retains the right to terminate the employment provided that reasonable notice is given. That, it seems, is the context in which the respondent found herself in 1983. Rather than insisting on her contractual rights, she chose to adhere to the modified terms of employment. That choice was made freely and it cannot be said that there was anything "unconscionable" about the circumstances in which it was made. (Recognizing that any judgment as to what is and what is not "unconscionable" is most subjective, what I am saying is that whatever judgment is placed on the situation, no legal remedy can flow from it.)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  Having decided that the annual contracts were binding on the complainant, it follows that the applicant's decision not to renew the last contract for the 1993-1994 school year was made in conformity with its terms and does not result in a dismissal within the meaning of s. 240(1) of the  
 Canada Labour Code 
 . As such, the case falls squarely within the ambit of the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  School Board and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where it was held that a decision not to renew a contract for a fixed term of employment did not constitute a dismissal. (Specifically, the Court of Appeal was called upon to decide whether a "dismissal" authorized by a term contract contravened s. 28(1) [now s. 168(1)] of the  
 Code 
 , which provides that the protection of employees against unjust dismissal applies notwithstanding any custom, contract or arrangement.)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  As the complainant was not dismissed, the adjudicator lacked jurisdiction to consider the complaint under s. 242 of the  
 Canada Labour Code 
 , and on that ground his decision is set aside.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

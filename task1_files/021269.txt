de Montigny, J.
: This is an application for judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [
IRPA
], seeking to set aside a decision dated September 4, 2013 rendered by Anthony da Silva [the Board Member] of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada [the Board], Refugee Protection Division. He found that the Applicant is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of
IRPA
.
[2]
For the reasons that follow, I have come to the conclusion that the decision of the Board must be quashed, as the Applicant was not given an opportunity to address many of the concerns which eventually led to the dismissal of his claim.
I.
Facts
[3]
The Applicant is a Bangladeshi citizen born on November 25, 1982 in Faridpur, Bangladesh. He claims that he faces persecution on the basis of religion. In support of that claim, the Applicant alleges the following:
i) The Applicant is part of the Hindu minority in his home village of Madhukhali, in Gopalpur region.
ii) Since 2005, the Applicant became involved in organizing Hindu youths to defend the Hindu minority in his village. Among other things, in 2007, he objected to the building of homes on Hindu temple land.
iii) On several occasions, he was the victim of harassment and violence by Muslim fundamentalists. On January 10, 2010, while rebuilding vandalized religious statues, Muslim extremists confronted him and threatened serious consequences if he continued rebuilding the statues. After this incident, he fled to the house of a friend in Dhaka. He later returned to his village. On March 13, 2010, the Applicant protested after a Hindu girl was raped and forced to marry her rapist and convert to Islam. As a result of this protest, he was insulted, beaten and threatened. He then hid at his sister's house in Chandpur, but he soon faced harassment there as well. On July 6, 2010, he was attacked while returning to his village. On January 21, 2011, members of the Jamat (a Muslim political party) attacked him and a group of Hindu youths returning home from a meeting. The Applicant and others submitted a written complaint against Jamat and other Muslim groups, but the police refused to respond.
iv) On February 23, 2011, the Applicant was arrested without warrant and beaten. He was released on bail the next day, and no charges were laid.
v) On March 26, 2011, Jamat and Horkatul Jihad "terrorists" attempted to kill him while he was returning home in a rickshaw. The attackers followed him home, but he fled to Dhaka. The attackers visited his family home in Madhukhali several times after this incident.
[4]
Following these incidents, the Applicant fled Bangladesh. A broker made arrangements for him to travel to Canada on a false passport. He arrived in Canada on May 5, 2011 and made a refugee claim on May 25, 2011.
II.
The impugned decision
[5]
The Board rejected the Applicant's claim. First, the Board expressed concerns with the Applicant's identity. Second, the Board found that the Applicant was not credible due to inconsistencies in his evidence. Finally, the Board found that there was an internal flight alternative (IFA).
[6]
The Board's concerns with respect to the Applicant's identity stem from the fact that the only document supporting his identity is his birth certificate. Several reports by UNICEF, American and Canadian officials indicate that Bangladeshi birth certificates are unreliable. Later in the decision, the Board repeats the concern about the Applicant's lack of identity documents and the prevalence of fraud in Bangladesh. The Board also found that the Applicant cannot corroborate his date of arrival in Canada because he arrived on a false passport. Therefore, the Board was "not entirely persuaded" of the Applicant's identity, Bangladeshi citizenship, or date of arrival in Canada.
[7]
The Board was also not convinced that the Applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution. The Board noted inconsistencies in three aspects of the Applicant's story: (1) incidents corroborated by newspaper articles; (2) the Applicant's whereabouts in 2010-2011; and (3) his arrest.
[8]
With respect to the incidents corroborated by newspaper articles, the Board noted that the article describing the January 10, 2010 incident does not conclusively establish the identities of those involved, and is slightly inconsistent with the Applicant's story. The article says that the people involved were "injured seriously" whereas the Applicant's account is that he was merely "injured". For the March 26, 2011 incident, the newspaper's account is essentially the same as the Applicant's testimony, except that the article refers to an eyewitness, whereas the Applicant's testimony does not.
[9]
As for his whereabouts, the Applicant claimed in his immigration interview on May 18, 2011 that he lived in Dhaka, Chandpur and Faridpur after January 2010. However, his Personal Information Form (PIF) and testimony describe incidents in his home village of Madhukhali, indicating that he was present in Madhukhali during this period. The Board questioned why the Applicant did not mention his time in Madhukhali in his immigration interview.
[10]
Regarding his arrest, the Applicant denied ever having been arrested or detained in any country in his immigration interview and refugee application form. However, the PIF, testimony and supporting documents recount the Applicant's arrest on February 23, 2011. The Board questioned the authenticity of the arrest documents. In any case, the documents conflicted with the Applicant's story: the Applicant claims he was arrested merely for making a complaint, but the documents say he was viewed as a catalyst for the religious unrest. The Board also remarked that the Applicant was detained for only one day, never charged, and released on bail.
[11]
Finally, the Board found that there was an internal flight alternative. Its reasons on this issue are quite cryptic, and amount to no more than the following paragraph:
[28] It would appear that whatever difficulties the claimant may have experienced or friction that may have existed between him and Muslim extremists has been localized around his home area. The panel, therefore, finds that relocation to either Dhaka or Chittagong would be a reasonable alternative for relocation and would not be unduly harsh.
III.
Issues
[12]
This application for judicial review raises two issues:
A. Did the Board breach procedural fairness with respect to the identity and/or the credibility issues?
B. Are the credibility and IFA findings reasonable?
IV.
Analysis
[13]
The standard of review is uncontroversial and is agreed upon by the parties. On issues of procedural fairness, the standard is correctness:
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . On the other hand, the standard of review for the substantive issues of credibility and IFA is reasonableness:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
A.
Did the Board breach procedural fairness with respect to the identity and/or the credibility issues?
[14]
The Applicant contends that the Board breached his right to procedural fairness in raising doubts about his identity in the decision, despite having advised counsel at the hearing that identity was not an issue. I agree. Pursuant to Guideline 7, the Board sent to the Applicant a screening form in advance of the hearing, which identified the issues it considered central to the claim. The only issue that was marked under the heading "Identity" was "Affiliation: Political/Religious/Social/Family"; the other boxes under that heading (including "Civil Status" and "Country of Reference") were not checked. When some subordinate boxes are checked while others are not, the Applicant may infer that the unchecked boxes are not at issue:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[15]
Even more importantly, the identity of the Applicant was never raised as an issue throughout the hearing, and no question was asked about the birth certificate and how it was obtained. Indeed, the Board Member advised Applicant's counsel prior to counsel's oral submissions that it had no concerns regarding the Applicant's personal or national identity, "so you do not have to make submissions on identity": Tribunal Record, p. 183. As a result, I have no hesitation in concluding that it was not open to the Board to draw an adverse inference from the alleged absence of documentary evidence to establish the Applicant's identity: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Natural justice requires that the Applicant be aware of the case to be met and be given the opportunity to make relevant submissions on the material issues. The Board breached the Applicant's right to procedural fairness in stating that the question of his identity was not an issue, only to raise it as a concern in casting doubt on the Applicant's credibility in its decision. Counsel for the Respondent conceded as much at the hearing before this Court.
[16]
Where the parties differ, however, is with respect to the consequences of this breach. Relying on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , counsel for the Applicant argues that this denial of natural justice is so egregious that it calls for the quashing of the decision. Counsel for the Respondent, on the other hand, submits that nothing turns on this mistake and that it was purely peripheral to the assessment of the Applicant's credibility.
[17]
Having carefully examined the impugned decision, I do not think it can confidently be said that this breach of procedural fairness had no impact on the decision of the Board. The Respondent's argument may have been more compelling had the Board Member not dealt with the identity issue after paragraph 16 of his decision. To the contrary, the Board's identity concerns appear to have permeated its credibility analysis and may have had a material impact on the Applicant's claim. At paragraph 23 of its decision, the Board mentions the Applicant's lack of personal identity documents in questioning the authenticity of the newspaper articles and the arrest documents. Most importantly, the Board explicitly links the identity concern with the credibility analysis at paragraph 27 ("The absence of documentation confirming both his identity and arrival in Canada is problematic and further contributes to an overall concern with the credibility of the claim"). Accordingly, it cannot be said that the breach of procedural fairness was not material and that there is no point sending the Applicant's claim back to the Board. This is not such a case as
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where it could safely be said that the Board would most likely reach the same decision if it were to re-examine the Applicant's claim afresh. There is every indication that the Board's assessment of the Applicant's identity coloured its credibility analysis.
[18]
This error, in and of itself, is therefore sufficient to quash the decision and to send it back to the Board for re-determination. However, there is more. The Board also had a number of concerns with respect to what were perceived as discrepancies between the newspaper articles and the Applicant's PIF and his testimony. The Board casts doubt on the January 10, 2010 assault, for example, on the basis that the newspaper article reports that the Applicant was "injured seriously" while he testified at his hearing and noted in his PIF that he had been "injured". As for the March 26, 2011 attack, the Board acknowledged that the newspaper article and the Applicant's PIF were consistent, but questioned the credibility of the Applicant on the grounds that the newspaper article identifies the presence of an eyewitness, while there is no mention of this in the PIF. Further, the article reports that the Applicant went to the police to complain about this incident, whereas there is no mention of such complaint in either his PIF or oral evidence. Yet, none of these concerns were put to the Applicant at the hearing.
[19]
I agree with the Applicant that when a hearing is conducted by way of reverse-order questioning (i.e. the Board asking the questions first and counsel questioning the applicant afterwards), the person with the onus is no longer in control of the process and there is an increased burden on the Board to ensure that issues which are determinative of the claim are raised at the hearing: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 15;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[20]
In the case at bar, the Board did take control of the hearing by putting its questions to the Applicant first. Yet the alleged discrepancies between the newspaper articles and the Applicant's story were never put to him. If the Board thought that the difference between an "injury" and a "serious injury" was significant, it should have asked questions about it. The same is true about the alleged discrepancies between the second newspaper article and the Applicant's report of the March 26, 2011 incident. Not only is it far from clear that the differences between the newspaper articles and the Applicant's PIF and testimony are significant (especially bearing in mind that the Applicant had no control over what the journalists wrote), but he was never provided any opportunity to explain away these differences. His lawyer could certainly not be blamed for thinking that the Board, not having questioned the Applicant on these issues, did not make much of the slightly different accounts of the two incidents between the Applicant and the media report.
[21]
It may be that the onus was on the Applicant to explain some of the other apparent discrepancies; for example, the differences between his evidence and the immigration notes with respect to his places of residence and whether he had been arrested or detained by the police. Even if the Board did not see fit to raise these issues at the hearing, the discrepancies are more obvious and striking and should have been addressed,
proprio motu
, by the Applicant through questioning by his counsel. The same is not true, however, of the alleged divergences between the Applicant's version of the events on January 10, 2010 and March 26, 2011, those being of much less significance and not originating entirely from the Applicant himself.
B.
Are the credibility and IFA findings reasonable?
[22]
I am also of the view that the Board's finding on IFA is not reasonable. The reasons are very brief and superficial, and they read more like a conclusion than like true reasons. It is quite simply impossible to determine the line of reasoning upon which the Board reached its conclusion.
[23]
The Board had to be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there was no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the proposed IFA and that, in all the circumstances, including the circumstances particular to the Applicant, the conditions in the proposed IFA were such that it was not unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge there. The Applicant testified that his life was in danger from the Muslim extremists who had been enquiring as to his whereabouts. It was also submitted that charges have been laid against him and are still pending. Finally, counsel stressed that as a Hindu, he would be vulnerable and subject to persecution and discrimination throughout the country. None of these arguments were mentioned, let alone addressed, by the Board Member. Accordingly, the Board's determination that the Applicant could relocate in Dhaka or Chittagong cannot stand.
V.
Conclusion
[24]
Having found that the Board breached its duty of procedural fairness in the assessment of the Applicant's identity and credibility, and having further come to the conclusion that its conclusion with respect to the IFA cannot stand, the application for judicial review is allowed, the decision must be quashed and the Applicant's claim must be remitted to another panel of the Board for re-determination. There is no need, having so found, to assess the reasonableness of the Board's credibility findings. No question is certified.
JUDGMENT
[25]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is allowed, the decision must be quashed and the Applicant's claim must be remitted to another panel of the Board for re-determination. No question is certified.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire fondée sur le paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR], visant à faire annuler une décision rendue par Anthony da Silva [le membre de la Commission], de la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada [la Commission], en date du 4 septembre 2013. Le membre de la Commission a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention, ni celle de personne à protéger au sens de l'article 96 et du paragraphe 97(1) de la LIPR.
[2]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, je suis parvenu à la conclusion que la décision de la Commission doit être annulée, car le demandeur n'a pas eu la possibilité de répondre à une grande partie des préoccupations qui ont mené au rejet de sa demande.
I.
Les faits
[3]
Le demandeur est un citoyen bangladais né le 25 novembre 1982 à Faridpur, au Bangladesh. Il prétend qu'il risque d'être persécuté en raison de sa religion. Il allègue ce qui suit au soutien de cette prétention:
i) il fait partie de la minorité hindoue dans son village natal de Madhukhali, dans la région de Gopalpur;
ii) depui 2005, il rassemble des jeunes hindous pour défendre la minorité hindoue dans son village. Il s'est notamment opposé à la construction de maisons sur le terrain d'un temple hindou en 2007;
iii) à plusieurs occasions, il a été harcelé et battu par des fondamentalistes musulmans. Le 10 janvier 2010, alors qu'il reconstruisait des statues religieuses qui avaient été vandalisées, des extrémistes musulmans l'ont menacé de graves conséquences s'il poursuivait ce travail. Après cet incident, il s'est enfui chez un ami à Dhaka. Il est retourné ensuite dans son village. Le 13 mars 2010, il a manifesté après qu'une jeune fille hindoue eut été violée et forcée d'épouser son agresseur et de se convertir à l'islam. En conséquence, il a été insulté, battu et menacé. Il s'est alors caché chez sa sœur à Chandpur, mais il a été harcelé à cet endroit également peu de temps après. Le 6 juillet 2010, il a été attaqué alors qu'il retournait dans son village. Le 21 janvier 2011, des membres du Jamat (un parti politique musulman) s'en sont pris à lui et à un groupe de jeunes hindous qui rentraient chez eux après une réunion. Le demandeur et d'autres personnes ont déposé une plainte écrite contre le Jamat et d'autres groupes musulmans, mais la police a refusé d'intervenir;
iv) le 23 février 2011, le demandeur a été arrêté sans mandat et battu. Il a été libéré sous caution le lendemain et aucune accusation n'a été déposée contre lui;
v) le 26 mars 2011, des « terroristes » du Jamat et du Horkatul Jihad ont tenté de le tuer alors qu'il retournait chez lui dans un rickshaw. Les agresseurs l'ont suivi jusque chez lui, mais il s'est enfui à Dhaka. Ils se sont rendus plusieurs fois à sa résidence familiale à Madhukhali après cet incident.
[4]
Le demandeur s'est enfui du Bangladesh à la suite de ces incidents. Un intermédiaire a pris des dispositions pour qu'il puisse venir au Canada au moyen d'un faux passeport. Le demandeur est arrivé au Canada le 5 mai 2011 et a demandé l'asile le 25 mai suivant.
II.
La décision contestée
[5]
La Commission a rejeté la demande du demandeur. D'abord, elle a dit qu'elle avait des doutes au sujet de son identité. Ensuite, elle a estimé qu'il n'était pas crédible à cause des incohérences contenues dans sa preuve. Enfin, elle était d'avis qu'il existait une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI).
[6]
Les doutes de la Commission concernant l'identité du demandeur découlent du fait que le seul document établissant son identité est son certificat de naissance. Plusieurs rapports de l'UNICEF et de représentants américains et canadiens indiquent que les certificats de naissance bangladais ne sont pas dignes de foi. Plus loin dans la décision, la Commission fait état à nouveau du manque de pièces d'identité et du nombre élevé de fraudes au Bangladesh. De plus, la Commission a estimé que le demandeur ne pouvait corroborer la date de son arrivée au Canada vu que son passeport était faux. En conséquence, elle n'était « pas entièrement convaincu[e] » de l'identité du demandeur, du fait qu'il était un citoyen bangladais ou de la date de son arrivée au Canada.
[7]
La Commission n'était pas convaincue non plus que la crainte de persécution du demandeur était fondée. Elle a relevé des incohérences au regard de trois aspects de son récit: (1) les incidents corroborés par des articles de journal, (2) l'endroit où se trouvait le demandeur en 2010-2011 et (3) son arrestation.
[8]
En ce qui concerne les incidents corroborés par des articles de journal, la Commission a fait remarquer que l'article décrivant l'incident du 10 janvier 2010 n'établissait pas de manière concluante l'identité des personnes qui y étaient mêlées et différait légèrement du récit du demandeur. L'article indique que ces personnes ont été « gravement blessées », alors que le demandeur a dit qu'il avait été simplement « blessé ». En ce qui concerne l'incident du 26 mars 2011, le récit paru dans le journal est essentiellement identique au témoignage du demandeur, mais, contrairement au témoignage du demandeur, l'article mentionne la présence d'un témoin.
[9]
En ce qui concerne l'endroit où il se trouvait, le demandeur a déclaré, au cours de son entrevue avec les autorités de l'immigration le 18 mai 2011, qu'il avait habité à Dhaka, à Chandpur et à Faridpur après janvier 2010. Or, il a décrit dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) et dans son témoignage des incidents survenus dans son village natal de Madhukhali, ce qui indique qu'il était présent à cet endroit pendant cette période. La Commission s'est demandé pourquoi le demandeur ne l'avait pas dit lors de son entrevue avec les autorités de l'immigration.
[10]
Au sujet de son arrestation, le demandeur a nié avoir déjà été arrêté ou détenu dans un pays quel qu'il soit lors de son entrevue avec les autorités de l'immigration et dans sa demande d'asile. Cependant, son arrestation survenue le 23 février 2011 est relatée dans le FRP, le témoignage et les documents à l'appui. La Commission a mis en doute l'authenticité des documents relatifs à l'arrestation. Quoi qu'il en soit, les documents contredisent la version du demandeur selon laquelle il a été arrêté simplement parce qu'il avait porté plainte et indiquent que le demandeur était considéré comme un catalyseur des troubles religieux. La Commission a aussi fait remarquer que le demandeur avait été détenu pendant une journée seulement, qu'il n'avait jamais été accusé et qu'il avait été libéré sous caution.
[11]
Enfin, la Commission a considéré qu'il existait une PRI. Ses motifs à cet égard sont plutôt sibyllins et se résument au paragraphe suivant:
[28] Il semblerait que toutes les difficultés que le demandeur d'asile a connues ou toutes les tensions qui peuvent avoir existé entre lui et les musulmans extrémistes aient eu lieu dans son village ou dans les environs de celui-ci. Par conséquent, le tribunal estime que le déménagement du demandeur d'asile à Dacca ou à Chittagong constituerait une possibilité raisonnable qui ne serait pas trop sévère.
III.
Les questions en litige
[12]
La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire soulève deux questions:
A. La Commission a-t-elle manqué à l'équité procédurale à l'égard des questions d'identité ou de crédibilité?
B. Les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité et à la PRI sont-elles raisonnables?
IV.
Analyse
[13]
La norme de contrôle ne prête pas à controverse et est acceptée par les parties. La norme qui s'applique aux questions d'équité procédurale est celle de la décision correcte:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Établissement de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . En revanche, la norme applicable aux questions de crédibilité et de PRI, qui sont des questions de fond, est celle de la raisonnabilité:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 12;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 13.
A.
La Commission a-t-elle manqué à l'équité procédurale à l'égard des questions d'identité ou de crédibilité?
[14]
Le demandeur soutient que la Commission a violé son droit à l'équité procédurale en soulevant des doutes au sujet de son identité dans la décision, malgré le fait qu'elle a dit aux avocats à l'audience que l'identité n'était pas en litige. Je suis d'accord avec lui. Conformément aux Directives 7, la Commission a fait parvenir au demandeur, avant l'audience, un formulaire d'examen initial qui mentionnait les questions qui, selon elle, étaient essentielles. La seule question qui était cochée sous le titre « Identité » était « Appartenance: politique/religieuse/sociale/familiale »; les autres cases figurant sous ce titre (notamment « État civil » et « Pays de référence ») n'étaient pas cochées. Lorsque seules certaines cases secondaires sont cochées, le demandeur peut conclure que celles qui ne le sont pas ne sont pas pertinentes:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 17.
[15]
Qui plus est, la question de l'identité du demandeur n'a jamais été soulevée pendant l'audience et aucune question ne lui a été posée au sujet du certificat de naissance et de la façon dont il avait été obtenu. En fait, le membre de la Commission a dit au conseil du demandeur, avant que ce conseil présente ses observations de vive voix, qu'il n'avait aucun doute quant à l'identité personnelle ou nationale du demandeur, [traduction] « de sorte qu'il n'est pas nécessaire que vous présentiez des observations sur la question de l'identité »: dossier du tribunal, à la page 183. En conséquence, je n'ai aucune hésitation à conclure qu'il n'était pas loisible à la Commission de tirer une conclusion défavorable de la présumée absence de preuve documentaire établissant l'identité du demandeur: voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . La justice naturelle exige que le demandeur sache ce qu'on entend faire valoir contre lui et ait la possibilité de présenter des observations pertinentes sur les questions importantes. La Commission a violé le droit du demandeur à l'équité procédurale en affirmant que la question de son identité n'était pas en litige, puis en disant que cette question la préoccupait lorsqu'elle a mis en doute la crédibilité du demandeur dans sa décision. L'avocat du défendeur l'a d'ailleurs reconnu à l'audience devant la Cour.
[16]
L'aspect sur lequel les parties ne s'entendent pas cependant concerne les conséquences de cette violation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , l'avocat du demandeur prétend que ce déni de justice naturelle est si grave qu'il exige l'annulation de la décision. Pour sa part, l'avocat du défendeur soutient que cette erreur n'est pas déterminante et qu'elle n'a qu'une importance secondaire au regard de l'appréciation de la crédibilité du demandeur.
[17]
Après avoir examiné avec soin la décision contestée, je ne pense pas que l'on puisse affirmer avec certitude que ce manquement à l'équité procédurale n'a eu aucune incidence sur la décision de la Commission. L'argumentation du défendeur aurait pu être plus convaincante si le membre de la Commission n'avait pas traité de la question de l'identité après le paragraphe 16 de sa décision. Au contraire, les doutes de la Commission concernant l'identité du demandeur semblent avoir imprégné son analyse de la crédibilité et ont pu avoir une incidence importante sur la demande du demandeur. Au paragraphe 23 de sa décision, la Commission fait état, en mettant en doute l'authenticité des articles de journal et des documents relatifs à l'arrestation, de l'absence de pièces d'identité du demandeur. Qui plus est, elle établit expressément un lien entre ses doutes au sujet de l'identité du demandeur et l'analyse de la crédibilité au paragraphe 27 (« L'absence de documents confirmant l'identité et la date d'arrivée au Canada du demandeur d'asile pose problème et s'ajoute à l'ensemble des préoccupations quant à la crédibilité de la demande d'asile. »). En conséquence, on ne peut pas dire que le manquement à l'équité procédurale n'était pas important et qu'il n'y a aucune raison de renvoyer la demande du demandeur à la Commission. La présente affaire est différente de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , où l'on pouvait affirmer sans risque de se tromper que l'Office aurait fort probablement rendu la même décision s'il avait réexaminé la demande de la demanderesse. Il ne fait aucun doute que l'appréciation que la Commission a faite de l'identité du demandeur a influé sur son analyse de la crédibilité.
[18]
Cette erreur est donc en soi suffisante pour annuler la décision et pour renvoyer l'affaire à la Commission pour qu'elle en rende une nouvelle. Ce n'est pas tout cependant. La Commission avait aussi certaines préoccupations concernant ce qui était considéré comme des divergences entre les articles de journal, d'une part, et le FRP et le témoignage du demandeur, d'autre part. La Commission met en doute l'agression du 10 janvier 2010, par exemple, parce que l'article de journal indique que le demandeur a été « gravement blessé », alors que celui-ci a affirmé dans son témoignage et a écrit dans son FRP qu'il avait été « blessé ». En ce qui concerne l'attaque du 26 mars 2011, la Commission a reconnu que l'article de journal et le FRP du demandeur concordaient, mais elle a mis en doute la crédibilité du demandeur au motif que l'article de journal fait état de la présence d'un témoin, mais pas le FRP. En outre, l'article signale que le demandeur est allé voir la police pour porter plainte au sujet de cet incident, alors qu'il n'en a rien dit dans son FRP ou dans son témoignage. Aucune de ces préoccupations n'a toutefois été portée à l'attention du demandeur à l'audience.
[19]
Je conviens avec le demandeur que, lorsqu'au cours d'une audience l'interrogatoire a lieu dans l'ordre inverse (c.-à-d. le demandeur est d'abord interrogé par la Commission, puis par son conseil), la personne ayant le fardeau de la preuve n'a plus le contrôle de l'instance et la Commission a une obligation plus grande de veiller à ce que les questions qui sont déterminantes soient soulevées à l'audience: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 15;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 33.
[20]
En l'espèce, la Commission a pris l'audience en main en étant la première à interroger le demandeur. Toutefois, les présumées divergences entre les articles de journal et la version du demandeur n'ont jamais été portées à l'attention de ce dernier. Si la Commission était d'avis que la différence entre une [traduction] « blessure » et une [traduction] « blessure grave » était importante, elle aurait dû poser des questions à ce sujet. Il en est de même en ce qui concerne les présumées divergences entre le deuxième article de journal et la plainte déposée par le demandeur relativement à l'incident du 26 mars 2011. Non seulement il est loin d'être clair que les divergences entre les articles de journal, d'une part, et le FRP et le témoignage du demandeur, d'autre part, sont importantes (compte tenu en particulier du fait que le demandeur n'avait aucun contrôle sur ce que les journalistes ont écrit), mais le demandeur n'a jamais eu la possibilité d'expliquer ces divergences. On ne peut certainement pas reprocher à son avocat de penser que, en n'interrogeant pas le demandeur sur ces questions, la Commission n'a pas fait grand cas des versions légèrement différentes des deux incidents faites par le demandeur et les médias.
[21]
Il incombait peut-être au demandeur d'expliquer certaines des autres divergences apparentes; par exemple, celles entre son témoignage et les notes prises par les autorités de l'immigration relativement à ses lieux de résidence et à la question de savoir s'il avait été arrêté ou détenu par la police. Même si la Commission a estimé qu'il ne convenait pas de soulever ces questions à l'audience, les divergences sont plus évidentes et plus frappantes et elles auraient dû être abordées par le demandeur, de sa propre initiative, lorsqu'il a été interrogé par son conseil. On ne peut pas en dire autant, par contre, des présumées divergences entre la version du demandeur des faits survenus le 10 janvier 2010 et le 26 mars 2011, ceux-ci étant beaucoup moins importantes et n'étant pas imputables entièrement au demandeur lui-même.
B.
Les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité et à la PRI sont-elles raisonnables?
[22]
Je suis également d'avis que la conclusion de la Commission concernant la PRI n'est pas raisonnable. Les motifs sont très brefs et superficiels et ressemblent davantage à une conclusion qu'à de véritables motifs. Il est tout simplement impossible de déterminer le raisonnement qui a amené la Commission à tirer la conclusion à laquelle elle est parvenue.
[23]
La Commission devait être convaincue, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'il n'existait aucune possibilité sérieuse que le demandeur d'asile soit persécuté dans la PRI proposée et que, compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances, notamment celles propres au demandeur, il n'était pas déraisonnable, vu les conditions existant dans la PRI, que le demandeur d'asile y trouve refuge. Le demandeur a déclaré dans son témoignage que sa vie était menacée par les musulmans extrémistes qui avaient voulu savoir où il se trouvait. On a aussi fait valoir que des accusations avaient été portées contre lui et qu'elles étaient toujours pendantes. Enfin, le conseil a souligné que, en tant qu'hindou, le demandeur serait vulnérable et exposé à la persécution et à la discrimination partout dans le pays. Aucune de ces prétentions n'a été mentionnée, encore moins examinée, par le membre de la Commission. En conséquence, la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle le demandeur pourrait déménager à Dhaka ou à Chittagong ne saurait être maintenue.

Conclusion
[24]
Étant donné que j'ai conclu que la Commission a manqué à son devoir d'équité procédurale lorsqu'elle a apprécié l'identité et la crédibilité du demandeur et, de plus, que sa conclusion concernant la PRI ne peut être maintenue, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie, la décision doit être annulée et la demande d'asile du demandeur doit être renvoyée à un autre tribunal de la Commission afin de faire l'objet d'une nouvelle décision. Compte tenu de cette décision, il n'est pas nécessaire d'apprécier le caractère raisonnable des conclusions de la Commission concernant la crédibilité. Aucune question n'est certifiée.
JUGEMENT
[25]
LA COUR STATUE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie, que la décision doit être annulée et que la demande d'asile du demandeur doit être renvoyée à un autre tribunal de la Commission afin de faire l'objet d'une nouvelle décision. Aucune question n'est certifiée.

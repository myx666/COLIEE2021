 MacKay, J. 
 : This is an application by the plaintiff H. Smith Packing Corporation, filed March 5, 1991, for an order pursuant to Federal Court Rule 460 (new rule 461) to strike out the defence filed in this matter by Hub Forwarding Company Incorporated and to enter judgment accordingly against that defendant as a result of its failure to comply with Federal Court Rules 447 and 448 and its failure to comply with the order of the Honourable Madame Justice Reed of this Court, dated November 13, 1990. The appli­cation also seeks costs on a solicitor/client basis against the defendant Hub Forwarding Company Incorporated. When the matter came on for hearing in Halifax on April 9, 1991, the motion was opposed by counsel for the defendant Hub Forwarding.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Recent procedural steps and activities giving rise to this application are as follows. When requests for production of a list of documents in accord with then rule 447 were not met by Hub Forwarding the plaintiff Smith applied to the Court by a motion dated November 6, 1990 for an order pursu­ant to then Rule 448 requiring the defendant Hub Forwarding "to make, file, and serve on the plaintiff a List of Documents that are or have been in its possession, custody or power relating to any matter in question in this matter" and "requiring the defendant Hub to make and file ... concurrently with the List of Documents an Affidavit verifying ... [that] List", and orders for setting the dates, times and place for discovery examin­ations and directing who should be dis­covered on behalf of Hub Forwarding. That application was heard by my colleague Madame Justice Reed, on November 13, 1990, and an order was made as requested in the following terms:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "It is hereby ordered that the defendant, Hub Forwarding Company Incorporated shall file its List of Documents and Af­fidavit of Verification and serve same upon the plaintiff along with copies of the documents referred to in said List of Doc­uments by no later than the 20th day of November, 1990.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "It is further ordered that Discovery exam­inations with respect to this matter will take place in Saint John, New Brunswick on the 4th and 5th days of December, 1990 at a place and time to be arranged by the plaintiff and the defendants will be notified accordingly by the plaintiff within two weeks of this Order of the place and exact time of the Discovery examinations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "It is further ordered the the defendant, Hub Forwarding Company Incorporated will provide Ross (or 'Russ') Melvin for Discovery Examinations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "It is further ordered that the plaintiff is awarded its costs of the application herein in any event of the cause. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [3] 
  In reasons for orders, issued on Novem­ber 13, Madame Justice Reed made the following comments at pp. 1-2 and p. 3, respectively:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "It is clear from the file that the defend­ants are not making any attempt to proceed expeditiously with this litigation. Quite the reverse appears to be the case; delay seems to be the order of the day.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "With respect to the request for the estab­lishment of a schedule for discoveries and the filing by the defendants of their affida­vits of documents, as I have already noted such an order is necessary. The defendants, particularly Hub Forwarding Company Incorporated, have exhibited a pattern of conduct which indicates that the establish­ment of a strict court ordered schedule is required. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 I note here that neither in the order itself nor in the reasons for the orders issued on that day is specific reference made to court rule 448 as the basis of the order directing pro­duction of a list of documents, though the terms of the order parallel that rule rather than rule 447 and counsel for the defendant had notice of the motion which specifically referred to rule 448.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  On November 20 a list of documents was filed on behalf of the defendant Hub For­warding by counsel. That list is said to be pursuant to rule 447 and it includes refer­ence to copies of three letters that had already been included in the list of docu­ments filed in August, 1990 on behalf of the plaintiff H. Smith Packing Corporation. Discovery was thereafter arranged by coun­sel for the defendant Hub Forwarding for December in accordance with the order of Madame Justice Reed but was subsequently postponed at the request of the plaintiff, then rearranged by counsel for the defendant Hub Forwarding and conducted in Saint John, January 9 and 10, 1991. During the course of discovery of the defendant Hub Forward­ing's witness there was discussion which made clear that the witness present, as ordered by the court on behalf of Hub For­warding, had not consulted all documents available to the company since he had in fact sent files relating to the matter to the company's head office in Massachusetts at an earlier date. Further, there was discussion between counsel about the lack of an affida­vit verifying the list of documents provided on behalf of Hub Forwarding which counsel for the plaintiff Smith Packing then indicated had been ordered by Madame Justice Reed. That indication may not have been then readily recollected by counsel for the defen­dant Hub Forwarding though it is clear from the terms of the order that such an affidavit was directed by this Court. Following exam­ination for discovery in January no further documents were provided by Hub For­warding before the filing of the notice of motion in this matter on March 5. Counsel for the defendant Hub Forwarding did then file on March 8 an affidavit verifying a list of documents, sworn by the president of the defendant Hub Forwarding Company Incor­porated, together with an appended list entitled "Defendant's Supplemental List of Documents (rule 447)". That list includes, in a schedule comparable to that applicable to rule 447 as it was in November, 1990, a list containing reference to the three letters included in its original list of documents filed November 20, 1990, together with reference to two others, each a file folder with Hub reference identification, but with­out a detailed list of the documents con­tained in either file folder.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  There is one further factor in the back­ground about which reference should be made. The  
 Federal Court Rules 
  relating to discovery and production of documents have changed since the order of Madame Justice Reed by reason of Amending Order No. 13, effective December 7, 1990, in relation to all newly filed actions and all parties who had not yet filed a list of documents under the former rule 447. I here set out the rules relevant in this matter at the time of Madame Justice Reed's order in November, 1990, and their counterparts applicable since December 7, 1990.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  In view of the change in the  
 Rules 
 , for the convenience of the parties in this action I deem rules 447 and 448 as they applied in November 1990 to continue to be applicable in this case. I do so technically because the defendant Hub Forwarding did file a list of documents pursuant to rule 447 prior to the date of change in the  
 Rules 
 , even though in retrospect that list appears incomplete and even though it did not meet with the requirements of the order of Madame Justice Reed made November 13, 1990. I consider the requirements of that order to be that rule 448, as it then was, be complied with, even though specific reference to that rule by number is not included in the terms of the order for those terms are obviously based upon rule 448 as it then was. I consider the motion now before the Court to arise pursuant to rules 453(2) and 461 as those  
 Rules 
  have been effective since December 7, 1990, by virtue of Amending Order No. 13.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  On behalf of the applicant it is urged that the course of conduct demonstrated by the defendant Hub Forwarding is one of delay and failure to disclose documents which, from the supplementary list filed on March 8, appear clearly to have been available from 1986 when this action was commenced. The documents from the company's files could have been produced in a list and available for discovery before the order of Madame Justice Reed in November of 1990, they should have been so produced in response to that order in accord with the timetable then established which would have made the list available before discovery of the defendant Hub Forwarding's witness in January, 1991. Thereafter, though their existence was revealed in the course of that discovery and undertakings were given to provide the documents, they were not forthcoming before this application was filed on March 4, 1991. Moreover, it is urged that the supplementary list of documents and the certifying affidavit filed on March 8 do not comply with the requirements of rule 448 in form or in failing to provide a detailed list of the documents in the company's files which were referred to in the supplementary list. Thus, it is said that the supplementary list does not comply with rule 448 or with the terms of Madame Justice Reed's order of November, 1990.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  For the applicant it is also urged that the defendant Hub Forwarding has clearly not complied with the terms of rule 458(2) as effective since December 7, 1990, which rule provides:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "458(2) A person who is to be examined for discovery shall, prior to the examination, become informed by making all reasonable inquiries of any present or former officer, servant, agent or employee of the party, including any who are outside Canada, who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge relating to any matter in question in the action. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 That rule is somewhat more precise but in my view it is clearly reflective of the spirit of the former rule 465(15), (16) and (17), which similarly required a witness who is to be examined for discovery to inform himself or herself, in advance of discovery, of matters related to the cause of action. The applicant submits that if the motion to strike the defence is not allowed the Court has discretion under rule 461, as effective since December 7, 1990, to order further discovery of the witness already examined as the representative of the defendant Hub Forwarding to order that further discovery take place in Halifax rather than in Saint John, and to award costs on a solicitor/client basis, both of this application and of any further discovery.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  On behalf of Hub Forwarding counsel suggests that if one reviews the history of this action since its initiation in 1986, not all delays have been the fault of the defendants or of Hub Forwarding though he concedes the conduct relevant for this application is that since the date of the order of Madame Justice Reed. Counsel indicated that he had sought to comply with that order, that it was oversight on his part that no affidavit certifying a list of documents was provided in November, 1990, when the original list of documents was provided in November, 1990, when the original list of documents was filed, though he pointed out that this had not been brought to his attention by counsel for the applicant before discovery in January or thereafter until the motion herein was filed. Counsel for the defendant Hub Forwarding appears to neglect reference to this matter brought to his attention by counsel for the applicant at the time of discovery in January, 1990. Following discovery in January, counsel for the defendant sought to obtain from Hub Fowarding's head office in the United States, copies of the files forwarded to that office earlier. An initial effort to forward such documents by the company was frustrated when they were lost by a commercial delivery service. Copies were finally provided and a certifying affidavit prepared and filed with the supplementary list of documents on March 8. At the hearing of this application counsel for the defendant Hub Forwarding did not concede that the supplementary list and the certifying affidavit filed in March still did not comply with the terms of Madame Justice Reed's order. I urged counsel to reconsider the form of the supplementary list and affidavit then filed in light of the terms of rule 448 as it was in November 1990. That rule makes reference to then Forms 20 and 21 which appear to be somewhat different from the text of the supplementary list and certifying affidavit filed on behalf of the defendant Hub Forwarding on March 8. In particular, I note that the supplementary list filed is said to be a list pursuant to rule 447.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Counsel for the defendant Hub Forwarding further urged that he had sought to meet the terms of the order of Madame Justice Reed, that any failure to do so in terms of form was his oversight, though he professed to have used documents in similar form in other proceedings in this Court. He urged also that at this stage Hub Forwarding was the only party to have met all of its undertakings from discovery, which it had done by providing the supplementary list of documents and copies of those, and that it had been pressing since discovery for a joint application to fix a date for trial, a proposal to which the applicant had not responded. In short, he affirmed that the defendant was anxious to proceed with this matter as quickly as was possible. In these circumstances he submitted that it would be extraordinary for the Court to grant the motion striking the defence filed on behalf of Hub Forwarding. That, he suggested, would be a very serious step and that the remedy sought was a drastic one which should only be considered in the most serious cases. Counsel relied upon the decision of Associate Chief Justice Jerome in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 457 (F.C.T.D.).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  After hearing from counsel for the parties I indicated that the application on behalf of the plaintiff to strike the defence filed by Hub Forwarding would be dismissed by order accompanying these reasons which were requested by counsel. My conclusion is based on the following factors. The relief sought, striking the defence, is a very drastic remedy for procedural failures and it ought not to be provided except where it is very clear that the defendant party's conduct constitutes an abuse of the process of the Court. I am not convinced that this is yet the case in this proceeding. I accept the assurance of counsel for the defendant that failure to meet the specific terms of the order of Madame Justice Reed of November 13, 1990, was oversight on his part and that he had in fact sought to comply with the order. While I accept that it was his oversight, that does not excuse him as an officer of the Court. Yet at this stage I am not prepared to find that oversight warrants striking the defence of the party for whom he acts. Further, I accept the assurance of counsel for the defendant that he is desirous of ensuring resolution of this matter as expeditiously as can be done.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  As for the alternate relief requested by counsel for the applicant at the hearing, that is ordering further discovery with costs against the defendant Hub Forwarding, I agree with the view expressed by counsel for the defendant that notice of such an alternative ought to have been given with the motion and that absent that notice the Court is properly concerned only with the relief requested in the notice of motion in advance of hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  Having so concluded I repeat comments made at the hearing that relations between counsel ought not to be permitted to affect the interests of the parties they represent. Counsel for the defendant Hub Forwarding ought to review documents filed as the supplementary list on March 8 in light of the order of Madame Justice Reed made November 13, 1990, granted as requested in an application for an order under then rule 448 and counsel should ensure that documents filed do comply with the order made pursuant to then rule 448. If counsel for the applicant seeks further discovery of the witness ordered produced on behalf of Hub Forwarding, who had not informed himself nor reviewed company files on matters relating to this cause of action prior to discovery in January 1991, I urge that this be expeditiously arranged by counsel. If that is not arranged without intervention of the Court I have little doubt that in the circumstances as they have been indicated to me I, or anyone of my colleagues, would not hesitate to order that there be further discovery and that costs to be borne by the defendant Hub Forwarding.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  In conclusion, an order goes dismissing the application for relief sought by the applicant, to strike the defence filed on behalf of the defendant Hub Forwarding. That order is made with costs to be in the cause.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
 [1] 
   
 Russell, J. 
 : This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC- 2001, c. 27 (Act) for judicial review of the decision of a designated Visa Officer at the Canadian Embassy in Beijing (Officer), dated 31 March 2011 (Decision). The Officer refused the Applicants' request for a Humanitarian and Compassionate (H&C) exemption under subsection 25(1) of the Act from paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations 
  SOR/2002-227 (Regulations). 
 
 
 
 BACKGROUND 
 
 
 
 [2] 
  The Principal Applicant, Feng Ce Sun, is a citizen of the People's Republic of China (PRC). He is seventeen years old and currently lives with his mother, grandmother, grandfather, uncle, aunt, cousin, and younger brother in the PRC. The Secondary Applicant, Kai Lau Sun, is the Principal Applicant's biological father and currently lives in Oakville, Ontario. He has been a Canadian citizen since 24 August 1994. 
 
 
 
 [3] 
  The Secondary Applicant came to Canada as a permanent resident in 1999. At that time, he did not know that he and the Principal Applicant were father and son. Because he was unaware of his relationship to the Principal Applicant, the Secondary Applicant did not declare the Principal Applicant on his application for permanent residence. 
 
 
 
 [4] 
  The Secondary Applicant had conducted an affair with the Principal Applicant's mother in the past, which ended in 1993 when she married another man. Shortly after her marriage, she conceived. In November 2009, the Principal Applicant's mother contacted the Secondary Applicant and told him they had a son together. At that time, the Principal Applicant was fifteen years old. At first, the Secondary Applicant refused to believe he had a son, but a DNA test in June 2010 confirmed their relationship. The Secondary Applicant accepted the Principal Applicant as his son and began to build a relationship with him. In 2010, the Secondary Applicant spent several months in the PRC visiting the Principal Applicant. During that period, they spent time together on weekends and during the Principal Applicant's vacation from school. While he was visiting the PRC, the Secondary Applicant bought the Principal Applicant clothing and gave him 70,000 Yuan - approximately $11,000. 
 
 
 
 [5] 
  On 25 January 2011, the Secondary Applicant applied to sponsor the Principal Applicant to Canada as a member of the family class under subsection 12(1) of the Act, section 116 of the Regulations, and paragraph 117(1)( 
 d 
 ) of the Regulations (Sponsorship Application). After the Sponsorship Application was paper screened by the Immigration Section at the Beijing Embassy, both Applicants were convoked for interviews with the Officer. The Officer conducted both interviews on 31 March 2011; she interviewed the Principal Applicant first, and then interviewed the Secondary Applicant. After she interviewed the Secondary Applicant, the Officer gave him her Decision orally. She said that she was not satisfied that H&C considerations existed in the Applicants' case which warranted an exemption. The Officer also sent the Applicants a letter on 31 March 2011. 
 
 
 
 DECISION UNDER REVIEW 
 
 
 
 [6] 
  The Decision consists of the letter sent to the Applicants on 31 March 2011 (Refusal Letter) and the CAIPS notes on the Applicants' file. 
 
 
 
 [7] 
  In the Refusal Letter, the Officer reviewed paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) of the Regulations, which reads as follows: 
 
 
 
 117 [...] (9) A foreign national shall not be considered a member of the family class by virtue of their relationship to a sponsor if 
 
 
 
 [...] 
 
 
 
 ( 
 d 
 ) subject to subsection (10), the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor and was not examined. 
 
 
 
                                                                                                      
 
 
 
 (9) Ne sont pas considérées comme appartenant à la catégorie du regroupement familial du fait de leur relation avec le répondant les personnes suivantes: 
 
 
 
 [...] 
 
 
 
 d) sous réserve du paragraphe (10), dans le cas où le répondant est devenu résident permanent à la suite d'une demande à cet effet, l'étranger qui, à l'époque où cette demande a été faite, était un membre de la famille du répondant n'accompagnant pas ce dernier et n'a pas fait l'objet d'un contrôle. 
 
 
 
 [8] 
  The Officer noted that the Secondary Applicant had not declared the Principal Applicant on his application for permanent residence in 1999; the Principal Applicant was not examined at that time. The Officer found that the Principal Applicant was excluded from the family class by paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) of the Regulations. 
 
 
 
 [9] 
  The CAIPS notes indicate that, at the interview, the Secondary Applicant said that he did not know about the Principal Applicant until 2009, which was why he did not declare the Principal Applicant on his application. The Officer found that the Secondary Applicant's reasons for wanting to be reunited with the Principal Applicant were reasons which did not go beyond any parent's wish to be reunited with a child. She found that these reasons could have been foreseen when paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) was enacted. 
 
 
 
 [10] 
  At the interview, the Principal Applicant had said that he lived with his mother and grandmother in the PRC and that both of them were unemployed. He had also said that they took care of his grandfather, who was ill, and that the family was in a difficult financial situation. He further said that his uncle, aunt, and cousin lived in the same house with them, and that he shared a room with his brother and cousin. The Officer noted that the Principal Applicant was seventeen years old, almost an adult, and was bright and energetic. She found that he appeared to be well taken care of by his family in the PRC, did well in school, and had been receiving financial support from the Secondary Applicant. The Officer also found that the main reason why it was difficult for the Secondary Applicant to be united with the Principal Applicant in the PRC was that the Secondary Applicant had business in Canada. 
 
 
 
 [11] 
  In the CAIPS notes, the Officer wrote that, although the Secondary Applicant had visited the Principal Applicant in the PRC for nearly six months, the Applicants had not spent much time together. She found that the Secondary Applicant had not made much of an effort to take care of the Principal Applicant on a daily basis. In his interview, the Secondary Applicant had said that he spent almost a whole month with the Principal Applicant, including a trip to Dalian - a city on the southern coast of the PRC - and that they had attended a spring festival together. The Secondary Applicant had also said at the interview that, if the Sponsorship Application were successful, he and the Principal Applicant would get an apartment together in the PRC, which would make it easier for him to be involved in the Principal Applicant's life. The Officer said that it was not clear why the Secondary Applicant's decision to get an apartment with the Principal Applicant depended on the outcome of the Sponsorship Application. 
 
 
 
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
 [12] 
  The Officer concluded that, based on the information in the Sponsorship Application and taking into account the Principal Applicant's best interests, she was not satisfied that an H&C exemption was warranted. Without an exemption, the Principal Applicant was permanently excluded from the family class under paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) of the Regulations. After reviewing subsection 11(1) of the Act, the Officer concluded that she was not satisfied that the Principal Applicant was not inadmissible or that he met the requirements of the Act. She therefore refused to issue him a permanent resident visa. 
 
 
 
 ISSUES 
 
 
 
 [13] 
  The Applicants raise the following issues in this case: 
 
 
 
 a. Whether the Officer's reasons are adequate; 
 
 
 
 b. Whether the Decision is reasonable; 
 
 
 
 c. Whether the Officer was alert, alive, and sensitive to the Principal Applicant's interests. 
 
 
 
 STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
 
 
 [14] 
  The Supreme Court of Canada in  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis. 
 
 
 
 [15] 
  In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Supreme Court of Canada held at paragraph 14 that the adequacy of reasons is not a stand-alone basis for quashing a decision. Rather, "the reasons must be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes." The first issue in this case, whether the Officer provided adequate reasons, is to be analysed along with the reasonableness of the Decision as a whole. 
 
 
 
 [16] 
  In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Supreme Court of Canada held that, when reviewing an H&C decision, "considerable deference should be accorded to immigration Officers exercising the powers conferred by the legislation, given the fact-specific nature of the inquiry, its role within the statutory scheme as an exception, the fact that the decision-maker is the Minister, and the considerable discretion evidenced by the statutory language" (paragraph 62). Justice Michael Phelan followed this approach in  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. The Federal Court of Appeal found at paragraph 18 of  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED that the standard of review on H&C determinations is reasonableness. The standard of review on the second issue is reasonableness. 
 
 
 
 [17] 
  In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Federal Court of Appeal held FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 
 [18] 
  Further, the Federal Court of Appeal held in  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED that, once an officer has identified and defined the best interests of the child, it is up to her to determine what weight those interests must be given in the circumstances. Where the best interests of a child lie is a question of fact which, following  
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, will attract a standard of reasonableness. The standard of review on the third issue is reasonableness. 
 
 
 
 [19] 
  When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See  
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, and  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."

 ARGUMENTS 
 
 
 
 The Applicants 
 
 
 
 The Reasons are Inadequate 
 
 
 
 [22] 
  The Applicants argue that the reasons they were given do not allow them to understand why the Officer denied their request for an H&C exemption. They do not know why the grounds they advanced were not sufficient to merit an exemption from paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) of the Regulations. In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Federal Court of Appeal held at paragraph 22 that simply reciting submissions and conclusions is not enough to meet the requirement for reasons. The Applicants say that, because the best interests of a child are implicated, it is not enough to simply list the ways that a child will be affected by the Decision (see  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED). 
 
 
 
 [23] 
  The Officer simply summarized the facts established by the Applicants' submissions and the interviews she conducted. She did not weigh the factors she was required to weigh and her reasons do not show that she was alert, alive, and sensitive to the Principal Applicant's interests as required by  
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
 The Decision is Unreasonable 
 
 
 
 [24] 
  Under subsection 25(1) of the Act, the Respondent may grant an exemption from any provision of the Act or Regulations which, if it were applied in a particular case, would result in unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. The Applicants say that the exclusion under paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) of the Regulations was meant to capture only dishonest applicants. The Secondary Applicant was honest and candid in his application for permanent residence to the best of his knowledge at the time he applied. The Applicants point to  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, and argue that the Secondary Applicant's honest misrepresentation is of a kind which should generally be granted an exemption. They say that the only avenue for them to be reunited in Canada is an H&C exemption under subsection 25(1) of the Act. 
 
 
 
 [25] 
  One of the purposes of the Act, as established by paragraph 3(1)( 
 d 
 ), is to see families reunited in Canada. In this case, the Officer did not consider whether this objective of the Act would be best served by granting or denying the Applicants' request for an H&C exemption. Because she ignored the overall scheme of the Act, the Decision is unreasonable. The Applicants rely on  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, and also point to  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, where Justice Michel Shore said FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 
 The Decision was Based on an Error of Fact 
 
 
 
 [26] 
  In the Refusal Letter, the Officer wrote that "your sponsor stated that the main reason why it is difficult for him to return to China [ 
 sic 
 ] to reunite with you is because he has business in Canada." Although the Secondary Applicant's business in Canada was a factor, it was not the only factor which made it difficult for him to be with the Principal Applicant in the PRC; the Secondary Applicant also had significant family obligations in Canada, which he pointed out in his submissions. When she looked only at the Secondary Applicant's business in Canada, the Officer fundamentally misapprehended the nature of the H&C request. This renders the Decision unreasonable. 
 
 
 
 The Officer made Improper Inferences 
 
 
 
 [27] 
  The Applicants say that the Officer inferred that the Secondary Applicant can continue to give the Principal Applicant financial support from the fact that he has given the Principal Applicant money in the past. The Officer appears to believe that the Secondary Applicant's financial support will address the financial difficulties faced by the Principal Applicant and his family in the PRC. In their submissions to the Officer, the Applicants said that the Secondary Applicant is concerned that the money given to the Principal Applicant goes to care for his grandparents and not directly to him. The Officer's inference that the Principal Applicant will continue to receive financial support is flawed because neither of the Applicants has control over where the money goes. 
 
 
 
 [28] 
  The Officer also inferred that, if he had truly wanted to support his son, the Secondary Applicant would have had the Principal Applicant live with him while he visited the PRC in 2010. The Officer drew this inference without taking into account that: when the Secondary Applicant visited the PRC, the Applicants had only recently met; the Principal Applicant attends school from 6:30AM to 9:30PM on weekdays; and the Applicants spent time together on weekends and during vacations. The Officer did not mention these facts, even though the Secondary Applicant repeatedly referred to them in his interview with her. 
 
 
 
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
 [29] 
  The Decision does not show that the Officer was sensitive to or understood the Principal Applicant's interests. The Officer also did not appreciate the Applicants' position and how paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) of the Regulations would actually affect them. If she had not made the errors the Applicants have alleged, the Officer would have concluded that there were sufficient grounds to grant their request for an H&C exemption. 
 
 
 
 The Respondent 
 
 
 
 [30] 
  The Respondent notes that the Secondary Applicant only learned of the Principal Applicant's existence when the Principal Applicant was seventeen years old. He also notes that the Principal Applicant is well taken care of in the PRC with the financial assistance of his father, and the financial assistance the Secondary Applicant provides addresses the financial difficulties which prompted the Principal Applicant's mother to inform the Secondary Applicant about their son. 
 
 
 
 The Reasons are Adequate 
 
 
 
 [31] 
  The Officer's reasons show that she considered and weighed all the evidence and relevant factors, so they are adequate. 
 
 
 
 Paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) is to have Strict Application 
 
 
 
 [32] 
  The Respondent refers to  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED where Justice Edmond Blanchard had the following to say, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, on paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) of the Regulations: 
 
 
 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSEDFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED.FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSEDFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 [33] 
  The Respondent says that paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) is not a bar to family reunification, but only operates to exclude applicants for permanent residence who have not been examined. The jurisprudence establishes that the reasons why an applicant has not been examined are unimportant and that 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) operates as a strict bar to future sponsorship under the family class. 
 
 
 
 No Error of Fact or Improper Inferences 
 
 
 
 [34] 
  The Respondent notes that H&C exemptions are exceptional and discretionary and are not designed to eliminate all hardship. Rather, they are directed at relieving unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship that may arise when applicants for permanent residence apply in the normal way. The Respondent says that the Applicants' submissions only amount to a disagreement with the Officer's conclusions and do not show actual errors of fact or improper inferences. He says that the errors the Applicants have alleged arise from a microscopic reading of the Decision. Contrary to the Applicants' assertions, the Officer was aware of the Secondary Applicant's family and business obligations in Canada. The Applicants' disagreement with the Decision is not a proper ground for judicial review (see  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED). 
 
 
 
 The Applicants' Reply 
 
 
 
 [35] 
  The Applicants note that the Respondent has incorrectly stated in his argument that the Principal Applicant was seventeen years old when the Secondary Applicant found out they were father and son. The Principal Applicant was actually fifteen years old when this occurred. The Applicants say that age is important when considering what kind of relationship will develop between two people. 
 
 
 
 [36] 
  Like the Officer, the Respondent has analysed the Applicants' relationship only in monetary terms. Although the Principal Applicant's mother may have contacted the Secondary Applicant about their son when she began to experience financial difficulties, this is irrelevant to the Applicants' relationship between the Applicants. The Applicants' actions show that their relationship was about more than monetary gain. 
 
 
 
 [37] 
  Although he argues that the Officer's assessment of the Principal Applicant's best interests was reasonable, the Respondent has not given any examples of how she conducted this assessment. All the Officer did was to list the factors which were relevant to her analysis of the Principal Applicant's best interests, without actually balancing these factors. 
 
 
 
 [38] 
  The Respondent has said that the Officer was aware of the Secondary Applicant's business and family obligations in Canada. Although the CAIPS notes show that the Secondary Applicant mentioned both of these obligations in his interview, the Applicants draw a distinction between recording answers and considering the facts they disclose. The Officer did not address the Secondary Applicant's family obligations in Canada, even though he raised them in his interview. Further, the Applicants say that the Respondent has not addressed the improper inferences they have alleged the Officer drew from the facts before her. 
 
 
 
 [39] 
  The Applicants concede that the Principal Applicant is barred from the family class by paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ) of the Regulations. However, what this case is actually about is the Officer's treatment of their request for an H&C exemption. They say that not knowing about a child is an exceptional circumstance which was not meant to be caught by the paragraph 117(9)( 
 d 
 ). Although theirs is a situation which seems to be appropriate for an H&C exemption, their request was refused based an unreasonable assessment and they were given inadequate reasons. 
 
 
 
 ANALYSIS 
 
 
 
 [40] 
  In  
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Supreme Court of Canada recently provided guidance for dealing with the adequacy of reasons of administrative tribunals:

 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSEDFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 
 [41] 
  Allowing all the deference that the Supreme Court of Canada says is required, and looking at the whole context of the evidence, the Applicants' submissions and the process, I cannot determine the reasons why the Officer denied the requested exemption. I also cannot determine what the Officer took to be in the Principal Applicant's best interests. The Decision is nothing more than a recitation of facts with a conclusion tagged on. In what appears to be the summation paragraph of the Decision, the Officer simply lists factors related to the situation in the PRC. She does not mention any benefits of the Principal Applicant coming to Canada. In the end, we have no idea of what the Officer thinks the best interests of the Principal Applicant are and no analysis to support the conclusion. The Decision is unreasonable. 
 
 
 
 [42] 
  It is well-established that an Officer must be "alert, alive and sensitive" to, and must not "minimize" the best interests of a child who may be adversely affected by their decision. See  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
 [43] 
  This Court has also instructed that being "alert, alive and sensitive" to a child's best interests is a separate analysis from consideration of the threshold standards of "unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship". As Justice Robert Barnes said in  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED: 
 
 
 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED 
 
 
 [44] 
  When assessing a child's best interests, an officer must establish: first what is in the child's best interest; second the degree to which the child's interests are compromised by one potential decision over another; and then, finally, in light of the foregoing assessment, determine the weight that this factor plays in the ultimate balancing of positive and negative factors assessed in the H&C application.

  There is no basic needs minimum which if met satisfies the best interests test. Furthermore, there is no hardship threshold such that if the circumstances of the child reach a certain point on that hardship scale only then will a child's best interests be so significantly negatively impacted as to warrant positive consideration. The question is not, "is the child suffering enough that his 'best interests are not being met'"? It is also not, "is the child surviving where he is?" The question at the initial stage of the assessment is, "what is in the child's best interests?"

  The Decision in the present case shows no awareness of what is required in any such analysis, so it is unreasonable and incomprehensible, and must be returned for reconsideration.

  Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.

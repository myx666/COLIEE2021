Noël, J.
[Translation]: The applicant is seeking to have four decisions authorizing disclosure of information relating to its business reviewed and set aside, under s. 44 of the
Access to Information Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1 (hereinafter referred to as "the
Act
").
[2]
These decisions were made in response to four separate requests made under s. 4 of the
Act
, which read as follows:
"
File no. T-2916-90
"Product complaint forms and follow up data (e.g., actions undertaken, etc.) re attached drug complaints involving illness in 1988-89 AND any 1990 forms/follow up.
"
File no. T-2885-90
"1989, 1990 list/record of drug manufacturers or importers who have a poor record of compliance who were subject to analytical surveillance (the DDAM system), or other follow up action/surveillance (such as the DDXM system that could indicate those in noncompliance with good manufacturing practices). Provide a few samples of actual reports resulting on specific drug manufacturers/importers.
"
File no. T-2912-90
"1. 1986 to 1990 adverse drug reports about Matol Botanical International Inc.'s mineral-herbal product registered with HWC.
"2. Any testing done before or after the DIN registration of this product.
"3. Data that could indicate the composition of this product.
"4. 1988 to 1990 problem or complaint reports/briefing notes on this product.
"5. 1986 to 1990 prosecutions/recalls of this product.
"
File no. T-1261-92
"Information on product 'Matol' by Matol Botanical of Montreal. Any complaints on product; outcome of complaints; charges brought by Health and Welfare; also any government action and/or investigations."
[3]
In response to each of these requests, the respondent sent the applicant a notice of intention to disclose, as is required by s. 27(1) of the
Act
. The applicant objected to the disclosure of the information requested, within the time allowed, and on October 4, 1990 (T-2885-90), October 11, 1990 (T-2916-90), October 18, 1990 (T-2912-90) and May 13, 1992 (T-1261-90) the applicant was advised by the respondent that he had decided to proceed with partial or total disclosure of the information requested. An application for review of each of these decisions was immediately brought in this court under s. 44 of the
Act
.
[4]
Three years later, but before the application for review was heard, a new notice of intention to disclose, covering additional information, was sent to the applicant in File no. T-2912-90. The applicant submitted written representations objecting to the disclosure of this new information. The applicant was advised by letter dated December 22, 1993 of the respondent's decision to proceed with disclosure of this information after certain information had been deleted in light of the representations made by the applicant. The letter in question included the following comment:
[Translation] "Since the Department of National Health and Welfare has already received your notice of motion to the Federal Court, under section 44 of the
Act
, it is not necessary to commence further proceedings."
[5]
The evidence established that the applicant's primary activities involve manufacturing and selling nonmedicinal mineral preparations made from a base of the flowers, leaves, roots and bark of certain plants, using a special process. The Canadian product is sold under the trademark "Matol". The sale of this product accounts for seventy percent of the applicant's volume of sales. Ninety percent of the applicant's sales are made outside the country, partly in the United States, where the product Matol is sold under the trademark "Km".
[6]
The applicant has over two hundred employees in Canada and distributes its products through a network of independent distributors made up of about a hundred thousand individuals throughout the world.
[7]
The information that is the subject of the four information requests overlaps and may be grouped into four broad categories. The first relates to complaints made to the respondent by users of the product Matol; the second relates to a voluntary recall carried out by the applicant in August 1988 in respect of certain manufacturer's lots of the product Matol; the third relates to certain analysis reports on the product Matol and a series of internal memoranda relating to the composition of the product; and the fourth relates to a criminal charge of false advertising in respect of the product Matol laid against the applicant in 1986, to which it pled guilty.
[8]
The statutory provision on which the applicant is relying is s. 20(1) of the
Act
, paragraphs (a) and (c) of which provide:
"20(1) Subject to this section, the head of a government institution shall refuse to disclose any record requested under this Act that contains
(a) trade secrets of a third party;
. . . . .
(c) information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to result in material financial loss or gain to, or could reasonably be expected to prejudice the competitive position of, a third party;"
[9]
The applicant contends that the respondent must refuse under ss. 20(1)(a) and 20(1)(c) of the
Act
to disclose the records requested, on the ground that they contain trade secrets belonging to it, and moreover, that disclosure could be expected to result in material financial loss to it or to prejudice its competitive position.
[10]
The applicant further contends that the subject-matter of certain records which it is proposed to disclose relates not to its actions, but to the actions of its independent distributors. In its view, the disclosure of this information in response to the information requests relating to the applicant would have the effect of attributing to it things which it did not do.
[11]
Finally, with respect to the disclosure of additional information in File no. T-2912-90, it contends that because the respondent has already made his decision in this matter, he did not have the power to change his mind, and accordingly that the records covered by this second decision cannot be disclosed.
[12]
The objection to disclosure under s. 20(1)(a) may be rejected summarily. The only information which it is proposed to disclose and which could be considered to be trade secrets is records reflecting the composition of the active ingredients used in manufacturing the product Matol. Given that the product Matol has been assigned a Drug Identification Number (DIN), that information is public in any event, since it is included in the product monograph that is required to appear on its label. [See footnote 1.]
[13]
In its objection under s. 20(1)(c) the applicant asserts that disclosure of the information will result in material financial loss to it or prejudice its competitive position. The authors of the affidavits produced by the applicant go so far as to state that, in their opinion, disclosure of the information will cause the certain death of the applicant's business.
[14]
In support of this argument, the applicant notes that the product Matol is intended for a special clientele, people who are familiar with natural products and are looking for improvements in their well-being through their diet. In its view, it is apparent that when this clientele is informed by the media that certain problems have been encountered in the past in connection with the product Matol, sales of that product will plummet. The applicant recognizes that a large portion of the problems recounted in the records covered by the applications are minor, but it contends that they are likely to be reported in an unbalanced manner reflecting a search for sensational news. It adds that there are some analysis reports which, although not negative in themselves, are likely not to be properly understood by neophytes because they are technical and complex. Referring to the media, the applicant asserts that it is apparent that they will attempt to use the problems it has encountered in the past to discredit the present product.
[15]
The respondent submits, in reply, that the affidavits on which the applicant is basing its objection to disclosure are incomplete and do not provide sufficient support for the allegation of prejudice to its business. Moreover, according to the respondent, there is no profile of the clientele or study of the fragility of that clientele in those affidavits. The certain financial collapse which is predicted is not supported by any figures. Similarly, the malevolent intentions attributed to the media and the aggressive interest that they would take in the applicant have not, in the respondent's view, been established in any way.
[16]
The respondent adds that the applicant survived the criminal conviction entered in 1986, eight years ago now, very well. He notes that, according to the evidence put forward by the applicant, its sales volume has increased more than tenfold despite the voluntary recall in 1988. With respect to the information relating to complaints filed in respect of the product Matol, the respondent notes that the records establish that these complaints were found to be unsubstantiated, generally speaking, and that they did not result in the imposition of any corrective measure.
[17]
Finally, the respondent submits that the guiding principle of the
Act
, which is set out in s. 2 thereof, confirms the right of the public to have access to records of the federal government, and that the applicant does not fall within any of what are described as the necessary exceptions provided by Parliament.
[18]
Like the respondent, I must conclude that the applicant has not established that disclosure of the records which are the subject of the four requests could reasonably be expected to result in material financial loss to it or to prejudice its competitive position, within the meaning of s. 20(1)(c) of the
Act
.
[19]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court of Appeal had to decide the meaning and effect of the exception set out in s. 20(1)(c) of the
Act
. MacGuigan, J.A., expressing the opinion of the court, stated at p. 60:
"Subsection 2(1) provides a clear statement that the
Act
should be interpreted in the light of the principle that government information should be available to the public and that exceptions to the public's right of access should be 'limited and specific'. With such a mandate, I believe one must interpret the exceptions to access in paragraphs (c) and (d) to require a reasonable expectation of
probable
harm.

This is not unlike the test adopted by Lacourcière, J., in a different context in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (H.C.), at p. 303, that 'Reasonable expectation ... implies a confident belief'."
[20]
In that case, the appellant was trying to prevent disclosure of inspection reports relating to the condition of certain slaughterhouses. The reports reached negative conclusions as to the physical condition of the facilities and the processing of the meat. As in this case, the appellant asserted that disclosure of the reports would cause it material financial losses. The Court of Appeal addressed and disposed of the issue as follows, at p. 64:
"In the cases at bar, I have carefully scrutinized each report and have also considered them in relation to the others requested. (I refrain from explicit comment on their contents to preserve their confidentiality through the time for appeal.) I would say in summary form that, although all are negative to some degree, I am satisfied in each case that, particularly now, years after they were made, they are not so negative as to give rise to a reasonable probability of material financial loss to the appellant, or of prejudice to its competitive position or of interference with its contractual or other negotiations."
[21]
Keeping this passage in mind, I find it easy to understand that the applicant might fear the dissemination of negative news concerning it and that it would prefer to avoid the risk that its prior conviction, which is now eight years old, and the voluntary recall of its product in 1988 might again be subject to comment that could come to the attention of its customers. However, there is a vast gulf between that fear and the applicant's assertion that the proposed disclosure of information would cause it material financial loss and even go so far as to cause the collapse of its business.
[22]
The evidence establishes that neither the 1986 conviction nor the 1988 voluntary recall had that effect. On the contrary, the evidence submitted by the applicant indicates that its sales volume has grown tenfold since 1988. After analyzing the recordation relating to the complaints brought against its product, I can say that they were found to be unsubstantiated and that they are therefore unlikely to have the negative impact attributed to them by the applicant. The same is true for the analysis reports, which note that at the time they were prepared there were sufficient or insufficient amounts of certain elements in its product, since in any event the evidence establishes that the problem, if problem there were, was solved when a new Matol product with different components was introduced in 1990. Given that evidence, the applicant's categorical assertion that disclosure of this information would cause it to collapse is laden with negativity that is devoid of any foundation and is, in any event, purely speculative.
[23]
Despite this, the applicant attributes malevolent intention to media organizations and asserts that the information in question will be conveyed in an unbalanced manner for the purpose of discrediting its business. I believe that, here again, this is an unfounded assertion. While I am prepared to accept the fact that the media sometimes convey information in a tendentious manner, I cannot assume, without any evidence to that effect, that they will act in bad faith or that they wish to discredit the applicant's business.
[24]
The applicant has established the possibility that disclosure of the information could, in the worst case scenario, have a negative impact on its business, but the evidence submitted falls far short of establishing a reasonable probability of material financial loss or prejudice to its competitive position. As was said in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 315, at p. 317: "... the applicant has shown the mere possibility that disclosure of the contract might interfere with its contractual or other negotiations". As the judgment of the Court of Appeal in that case establishes, this is not in itself sufficient to open the way for the exception set out in s. 20(1)(c) of the
Act
to apply. I therefore cannot, for that reason, accept the general objection made by the applicant to disclosure of the information.
[25]
The applicant raises two other arguments for the purpose of preventing disclosure of specific records. First, it says that some records describe how it distributes its product, through a network of independent vendors, and also representations that those vendors make with respect to its product. It points out that these vendors are not under its control and that the effect of disclosure of this documentation would be to attribute to it things which it did not do. I agree. According to the evidence before me, these vendors are independent contractors, and so information relating to them and to the method of distribution should in principle be part of a separate file from the file compiled with respect to the applicant. Moreover, counsel for the respondent expressed her consent on this point. The following records will therefore be exempted from disclosure or subject to the deletions set out below:
File no. T-1261-92
- record no. 17, memorandum addressed to J. Riou dated December 7, 1988;
- record no. 24, memorandum addressed to M.L. Hayes dated September 19, 1988;
- record no. 2, summary of an interview held on April 4, 1985; the second full paragraph and the paragraph preceded by the number 4 are deleted;
File no. T-2912-90
- record no. 6, memorandum addressed to J.F. Riou dated December 7, 1988.
[26]
Finally, the applicant submits that the respondent did not have the power to make a second decision in File no. T-2912-90 and accordingly that the additional information that is subject to that second decision should not be disclosed.
[27]
The supplementary confidential affidavit of Yvette Arvisais filed by the respondent in this case establishes the chronology of the events that preceded the bringing of the application. The information request was received by the respondent on February 20, 1990. The records which are the subject of the application were identified and a notice of intention to disclose was sent to the applicant under s. 27 of the
Act
on or about August 21, 1990. The applicant submitted its written representations against disclosure on September 7, 1990, in accordance with s. 28(1)(a) of the
Act
. On October 8, 1990, the respondent gave notice of his decision to disclose the information under s. 28(1)(a) of the
Act
and on November 1, 1990, the applicant brought its application for review of that decision under s. 44 of the
Act
.
[28]
Despite the initial decision, the respondent informed the applicant by letter dated November 3, 1993, of his intention to disclose additional information. That letter read in part as follows:
[Translation] "In my letter of October 18, 1990, I informed you of our decision to disclose parts of certain records and that the parts that have been deleted were the subject of an exception under subsections 19(1), 20(1)(b) and 20(1)(c) of the
Access to Information Act
.
"On November 1, 1990, the Department of National Health and Welfare received your notice of motion to the Federal Court - Trial Division under section 44 of the
Act
.
"Upon receipt of your notice of motion, we undertook a second review of these records. We wish to advise you that certain information which initially seemed to be subject to an exception under subsections 20(1)(b) and 20(1)(c) should rather be disclosed under subsection 20(2) of the
Act
. Accordingly, this is to advise you of our decision to disclose the information underlined in yellow in the enclosed records.
"Although these records may contain information covered by paragraphs 20(1)(b) or 20(1)(c) of the
Act
, in our opinion they contain results of product or environmental testing carried out by or on behalf of a government institution. Accordingly, under subsection 20(2) of the
Act
, we cannot refuse to disclose it.
. . . . .
"Second, we wish to advise you that certain other information which was originally exempted under subsections 20(1)(b) and 20(1)(c) should now be disclosed under the
Act
. This is in order to ensure that the treatment of this access request complies with the recommendations to disclose made elsewhere in this request and in request HP1493. Accordingly, this is to inform you of our decision to disclose this information, which is underlined in green."
[29]
It concluded by inviting the applicant to submit comments within twenty days.
[30]
The applicant submitted its representations and, on December 22, 1993, the respondent informed it of his decision, as follows:
[Translation] "First, we have examined your arguments, but we are still of the view that the information which has been requested is covered by subsection 20(2) of the
Act
and should be disclosed.
"Second, after examining your arguments, we agree to delete certain parts of these records before disclosing them. We believe that the deleted parts are subject to an exception under 20(1)(b), 20(1)(c) and 20(1)(d) of the
Access to Information Act
."
[31]
The letter concludes as follows:
"Since the Department of National Health and Welfare has already received your notice of motion to the Federal Court under section 44 of the
Act
, it is not necessary to commence another proceeding."
[32]
Several days later, on December 30, 1993, the respondent advised the applicant of another new decision, this time in File no. T-2885-90. The effect of that decision was to delete in this file the information that had been deleted in File no. T-2912-90 from the additional records to be disclosed under the decision of December 22, 1990. The decision was stated as follows:
[Translation] "The Department of National Health and Welfare has received your submissions in response to our notice of November 3, 1993, concerning request no. HP1494. After examining your arguments, we agree to delete certain parts of these records before disclosing them.
"Please note that these records were identified in request no. HP1493. We simply want to make you aware that the parts deleted from the enclosed records are also subject to an exception under paragraphs 20(1)(b), 20(1)(c) and 20(1)(d) of the
Access to Information Act
.
"Since the Department of National Health and Welfare has already received your notice of motion to the Federal Court, it is not necessary to commence another proceeding."
[33]
In my view, neither of these late decisions has the force of law. Section 28(1)(b) of the
Act
provides that the respondent was required:
"within thirty days after the notice is given, ..., [to] make a decision as to whether or not to disclose the record or the part thereof and give written notice of the decision to the third party."
[34]
This is what was done in each of these files three years earlier: on October 4, 1990, for the information in File no. T-2885-90, and on October 18, 1990, for the information in File no. T-2912-90. The
Act
does not authorize the institution in question to sit on appeal from its own decision and from the outset to decide what the outcome will be on two subsequent occasions. Only one decision may be made with respect to an information request, and once it is made the institution in question does not have the discretion to get around it.
[35]
This is clear from the scheme of the
Act
, which sets out a very precise timetable and detailed procedure for processing an information request and with respect to the decision-making process which the institution concerned must follow.
[36]
Section 7 sets out the rule that an information request must in principle be processed and resolved within thirty days after it is received by the institution in question. Section 9(1) permits the head of the institution to extend this time limit in certain circumstances, and requires that, if this is to be done, he or she give notice to the person who made the request and inform that person of his or her right to make a complaint about the extension.
[37]
Similarly, s. 27(1) requires that the institution in question give notice to a third party with an interest in the matter within thirty days after an information request is received. This time limit may be extended but any extension shall in no circumstances be for a period longer than the period of the extension under s. 9(1).
[38]
Finally, s. 28(1) requires that the institution in question invite a third party who has been given notice under s. 27(1) to submit representations within thirty days after the notice is received and requires the institution in question to make its decision as to whether or not to disclose the information within thirty days after the notice is given.
[39]
While these time limits are not mandatory [see footnote 2], the
Act
nonetheless provides for a very precise decision-making process which must, on its face, result in only one decision.
[40]
The second decision made in File no. T-2912-90 is not intended to correct a clerical error. As established by the letters of November 3 and December 22, 1993, the respondent simply changed his mind on the question of whether or not the additional records should be disclosed. At the time when the first decision was made, he had concluded that these records were exempted under s. 20. In his second decision, three years after the fact, the respondent claimed to be exercising his decision-making power again by reversing his first decision respecting the additional records in question. That second decision is void and of no effect since the
Act
authorizes the institution concerned to make only one decision with respect to a single request, that being the decision made in November 1990.
[41]
For these reasons, all of the additional information covered by the respondent's decision, which was communicated to the applicant by letter dated December 22, 1993, in File no. T-2912-90, as identified in paragraph 10 and Exhibit "G" of the supplementary confidential affidavit of Yvette Arvisais sworn on February 4, 1994, are excluded from the information that the respondent is authorized to disclose.
[42]
For the same reasons, the decision relating to the additional deletions which was communicated by letter dated December 30, 1993, in File no. T-2885-90, is also void and of no effect. However, these additional deletions are based on the respondent's sworn statement that the information that has been deleted therefrom must be exempted from disclosure under s. 20(1) of the
Act
, as established by paragraph 9 of the supplementary confidential affidavit of Yvette Arvisais. This is a judicial admission to which neither the applicant nor the intervener objected and which is justified under the relevant provisions. The same is true for the additional deletions made by the respondent in File no. T-2912-90 following the decision of December 22, 1993. The deletions set out in paragraph 9 and Exhibit "F" of the supplementary confidential affidavit of Yvette Arvisais sworn on February 4, 1994, and those set out in paragraph 10 and Exhibit "G" of that affidavit must therefore be made in each of those files.
[43]
Orders giving effect to these reasons will issue in each of the files. Since success has been divided, I shall not award any costs.
Application allowed in part.

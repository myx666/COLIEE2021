O'Keefe, J.
: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act) for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division (the Board), dated June 14, 2011, wherein the applicants were determined to be neither Convention refugees within the meaning of section 96 of the Act, nor persons in need of protection as defined in subsection 97(1) of the Act. This conclusion was based on the Board's finding that the applicants faced a generalized rather than personalized risk in Honduras.
[2]
The applicants request that the Board's decision be set aside and the matter be referred back for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.
Background
[3]
The principal applicant is Ingrid Jasmine Mesa Soler De Mungui. The other applicants are related to her as follows: Marco Antonio Munguia Oqueli, husband and Andree Anthonioly Munguia Meza, minor son. All the applicants are citizens of Honduras.
[4]
The principal applicant and her husband both held well-paying jobs in Honduras. In 2004, members of the organized crime group, Mara Salvatrucha (referred to as the MS or Mara), approached them and demanded money. The gang threatened the applicants should they report them to the police, whom the gang claimed they had good connections with.
[5]
Initially, the applicants refused to meet the MS's demands. The gang therefore started persecuting the applicants; robbing, assaulting and threatening them in May 2005. Thereafter, the applicants complied with the gang's demands.
[6]
In April 2007, the MS discovered that the applicants were earning more money. They therefore increased their demands. The applicants told them it was too much. However, the MS merely responded by threatening them further. To escape the increasing demands, the applicants moved to a different city and changed their car to hide their identity. However, in December 2008, the MS found them and forced them to pay. In April 2009, the MS increased their demands again. The applicants paid, but also decided to leave the country to avoid further persecution.
[7]
The applicants did not know the name of the alleged perpetrators nor did they file any complaints with the police, except on one occasion two days before their departure from Honduras. The applicants filed this complaint so that their problems could be incorporated into government statistics. The following day, the applicants received a note stating that their son would be kidnapped if they did not pay a large sum of money.
[8]
The applicants left Honduras on August 16, 2009. They travelled north through the United States, arriving in Canada on September 2, 2009. The applicants filed their refugee claims at the United States-Canada border.
[9]
The hearing of the applicants' refugee claims was held on May 9, 2011.
Board's Decision
[10]
The Board issued its decision on June 14, 2011. Notice of the decision was issued on July 13, 2011.
[11]
The Board first summarized the applicants' allegations. The Board also accepted the applicants' identities as claimed.
[12]
The Board then addressed the question of nexus under section 96 of the Act. It found that the applicants' fear was not linked to any of the Convention grounds, but rather that the applicants were victims of criminality. The Board noted that victims of criminality generally do not establish a link between their fear of persecution and any of the Convention grounds. Therefore, the Board denied the applicants' claims under section 96 of the Act.
[13]
Turning to the section 97 analysis, the Board first noted that the applicants left Honduras by entering the United States illegally and from there, travelling to Canada where they filed their refugee claims. They did not file their claims in the U.S. as they were advised by relatives in the U.S. and Canada that they were more likely to receive help in Canada. However, the Board found that persons with a well-founded fear of persecution would attempt to apply for refugee protection without unreasonable delay. Thus, their failure to seek asylum in the U.S. indicated a lack of subjective fear. Nevertheless, the Board noted that this was not the determinative issue. Rather, the determinative issue was whether the applicants faced a generalized or personalized risk.
[14]
The Board noted that risk under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act must be personal, faced in every part of the country and not generally faced by others. The Board reviewed the documentation before it. It noted that Honduras was considered one of the most violent countries in Latin America with high levels of youth violence, murder and gangs. The MS became prominent in the late 1980s and were well entrenched and responsible for many crimes in the country.
[15]
Based on this review, the Board found that the applicants feared the MS and the gang's acts of criminality that affect the general population in Honduras. As they shared the same risk as other similarly situated persons with good incomes, their risk was not a personalized risk. The Board found that the applicants were pursued for extortion purposes because the MS believed they had money; just as the MS pursued other citizens in Honduras with means. The fact that the applicants were identified personally as a target did not necessarily remove them from a generalized risk category as the nature of this risk was one faced generally by others in the country. As such, the Board found on a balance of probabilities that the applicants' alleged risk was generalized. The Board therefore denied the applicants' claim under subsection 97(1) of the Act.
Issues
[16]
The applicants submit the following point at issue:
Did the Board err in finding that the applicants faced a generalized risk when they had been specifically targeted for assaults and robbery by the MS gang and the Board accepted that"the [applicants] were approached for extortion purposes by the [MS] just like other people in Honduras, such as in these [applicants'] particular situation and circumstances i.e., perceived to be capable of paying money to the [MS] ".
[17]
I would rephrase the issues as follows:
1. What is the appropriate standard of review?
2. Did the Board err in its assessment of the nature of the applicants' risk under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii)?
Applicants' Written Submissions
[18]
The applicants submit that the only issue in this case is the interpretation of the phrase "not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country" in subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act. The applicants submit that when the principles that have emerged in the jurisprudence on this provision are applied to this case, it is clear that the applicants were personally targeted for murder by the MS as a result of their refusal to meet the extortion demands. Rather than being at risk because of their employment or economic class, the applicants were at personal risk because they refused to pay the extortion demands. As such, there was no doubt that the applicants would be personally in danger if returned to Honduras. The Board made a patently unreasonable error in finding that they were not persons in need of protection because they faced a generalized risk.
Respondent's Written Submissions
[19]
The respondent submits that the question of what constitutes a generalized risk under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) is one of mixed fact and law that is reviewable on a reasonableness standard.
[20]
The respondent submits that the Board did not err in finding that the risk faced by the applicants in Honduras is one faced generally by the population. The documentary evidence clearly supported this finding. Further, the Board did consider the applicants' personal situation in rendering its decision.
[21]
The respondent also submits that while the applicants may have been victimized for not complying with the MS's demands, this does not establish a risk under section 97 if it is one generally faced by the population. The applicants did not provide evidence to demonstrate that the Board's factual finding that the MS constitutes a widespread risk for all citizens was in error. Further, wealth does not constitute a personalized risk under section 97. There was no evidence on the record that the applicants faced any personalized risk.
Analysis and Decision
[22]
Issue 1
What is the appropriate standard of review?
Where previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 57).
[23]
The issue of whether an applicant faces a personalized risk, as opposed to a generalized risk, arises from the application of subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act and is reviewable on a reasonableness standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 270 at paragraphs 1, 9 and 11;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 1243 at paragraph 36; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 1277 at paragraph 26).
[24]
In reviewing the Board's decision on a standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the Board came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 47; and
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, it is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (at paragraphs 59 and 61).
[25]
Issue 2
Did the Board err in its assessment of the nature of the applicants' risk under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii)?
Under subsection 97(1)(b) of the Act, applicants may be found in need of protection if their removal would subject them personally to a risk to their life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, for which they are unable, or unwilling due to the risk, to avail themselves of state protection. This analysis entails a case-by-case determination of the real and particularized threat directed at the applicant (see
Innocent
above, at paragraph 42). Victims of crime do not qualify as persons in need of protection under section 97 of the Act for that reason alone - the determination must be based on the specific circumstances of each case (see
Innocent
above, at paragraph 67).
[26]
In this case, the determinative issue in the Board's decision was whether the risk that the applicants faced was personalized. Based on the evidence before it, the Board found that this risk was not personalized, but rather generalized and faced by other similarly situated persons in Honduras. The applicants submit that the Board erred in coming to this decision because their risk was indeed personalized. This personalized risk arose from their repeated refusal to pay the MS's extortion demands, which differentiated them from other citizens that were either not targeted or had abided to the MS's demands.
[27]
In its decision, the Board cited extensive jurisprudence in support of its finding that the fact that individuals may be victimized repeatedly or more frequently by criminals did not personalize their risk if it was a risk generally faced by others; particularly where they were victimized due to: their perceived wealth; the location of their home in a more dangerous area; their pursuit after reporting to police or relocating; or the fact that they faced retaliation for not complying with the demands of criminals.
[28]
The jurisprudence cited by the Board supports these findings.
[29]
For example, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] FCJ No 817, the applicants were wealthy citizens of Honduras. At paragraph 25, I held that:
The applicants are members of a large group of people who may be targeted for economic crimes in Honduras on the basis of their perceived wealth. The applicants submitted that the Board erred in imposing too high a standard upon them in requiring that they prove that they would be personally at risk. Given the wording of subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of IRPA, the applicants had to satisfy the Board that they would be personally subjected to a risk that was not generally faced by others in Honduras. The application for judicial review is therefore dismissed.
[30]
Similarly, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 415 at paragraph 17 (upheld on appeal:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 143), Madame Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer found that (at paragraph 23):
Based on the recent jurisprudence of this Court, I am of the view that the applicant does not face a personalized risk that is not faced generally by other individuals in or from Haiti. The risk of all forms of criminality is general and felt by all Haitians.
While a specific number of individuals may be targeted more frequently because of their wealth, all Haitians are at risk of becoming the victims of violence
. [emphasis added]
[31]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 1275, Mr. Justice Michael Kelen explained the rationale for finding that wealth was not a personalized risk (at paragraph 35):
I am of the view that if the risk to violence or injury or crime is a generalized risk faced by all citizens of the country who are seen as relatively wealthy by the criminals, the fact that a specific number of individuals may be targeted more frequently because of their wealth, does not mean that they are not subject to a "generalized risk" of violence. The fact that the persons at risk are those perceived to be relatively wealthy, and can be seen as a subset of the general population, means that they are exposed to a "generalized risk". The fact that they share the same risk as other persons similarly situated does not make their risk a "personalized risk" subject to protection under section 97.
A finding otherwise would "open the floodgates" in that all Guatemalans who are relatively wealthy, or perceived as being relatively wealthy, could seek protection under section 97 of IRPA
. [emphasis added]
[32]
In
Innocent
above, Mr. Justice Robert Mainville recognized that:
... where the general population faces a risk of criminality, the fact that certain individuals are more likely to face this risk, either because they live in more dangerous areas, or because they are perceived as being more affluent, does not necessarily make those individuals eligible for protected person status under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii)" (at paragraph 49).
[33]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 788, Mr. Justice Russel Zinn explained that risk does not become personalized for the sole reason that victims relocate to escape persecution and are followed by their persecutors (at paragraph 33):
I do not accept the applicants' submission that the risk they faced became personalized when their agents of persecution followed them after they relocated. A crime does not become particularized persecution just because the criminals, in this case the Mexican police, follow their victims over some geographic distance. The fact that the applicants were being targeted does not make their risk one that is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.
[34]
Finally, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] FCJ No 23, the applicant was unable to make an extortion payment to a criminal gang and thereby faced risk of retaliation. However, Mr. Justice Pierre Blais upheld the Board's decision that this risk was generalized rather than personalized because it was reasonable based on the evidence before it (at paragraphs 18 and 19). Similarly, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, the Court upheld the Board's decision that a bus driver who had reported a gang's crimes and thereby faced retaliation, had a generalized rather than personalized risk. This even though the evidence included the murder of the applicant's brother-in-law in retaliation for the bus driver's reporting to the police (at paragraph 36).
[35]
In this case, all of the above enumerated elements were present. Both adult applicants held good jobs with good salaries and were therefore perceived as wealthy. At the hearing, the principal applicant admitted that her neighbours had also been threatened, suggesting that they lived in a community where threats were common. The applicants' evidence also indicated that they were pursued after relocating and that kidnapping threats were made after they filed their complaint to the police. Further, they testified that they feared retaliation if returned due to their failure to comply with the MS's demands.
[36]
Based on the documentary evidence before it that showed widespread gang violence across the country, I find that the Board rendered a reasonable finding that the risk faced by the applicants in Honduras was generalized rather than personalized. The evidence suggested that the risk of crime from gangs was experienced by the whole population generally, albeit at a potentially reduced frequency (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 1021 at paragraph 22).
[37]
However, the applicants rely on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] FCJ No 501 to support their position. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> a above, the applicant was targeted for recruitment by a gang in El Salvador. When he refused to join, he was threatened repeatedly, the family home was placed under surveillance and the applicant finally fled his country. The Board in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, denied the applicant's claim on the basis of his testimony that street gangs recruited across the country and targeted all levels of society, thereby rendering the risk he faced general as opposed to personal. In coming to this decision, the Board relied solely on the applicant's testimony at the hearing, ignoring the submissions in his Personal Information Form that he had been personally subjected to danger. This was the Board's fatal error.
[38] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, has often been distinguished by this Court. In
De  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Zinn explained that the key factor that led to the Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> overturning the Board's decision was that the Board did not consider the fact that the applicant had been personally targeted by the gang because he refused to be recruited to their cause (at paragraph 25). In distinguishing
De Parada
from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, Mr. Justice Zinn explained (at paragraph 25):
Here the Applicants have not been targeted personally by the MS, rather they, as a part of a large group of business persons who are perceived to be well-off, have been targeted. That is a generalized and not a personalized risk.
[39]
This case is also distinguishable from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, because the Board did consider the personal circumstances of the applicants. However, the evidence indicated that the risk they faced was not a personalized risk but rather a more generalized risk as wealthy citizens targeted for extortion in Honduras. Recognizing that there is a fine distinction between a generalized and personalized risk that depends on the facts of each case (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 36), I find the Board came to a reasonable conclusion on this issue based on the evidence before it. I would therefore dismiss this application.
[40]
The applicant submitted the following proposed question for my consideration for certification as a serious question of general importance:
Section 97(1)(b)(ii) of IRPA requires the RPD to determine whether the risk that would be faced by the claimant upon return is a risk which is "
faced generally by other individuals in or from that country
".When making this determination, is it an error for the RPD to consider only the
nature
of the risk, and not also assess and consider the
probability
of the claimant succumbing to that risk, as compared to the probability facing"
other individuals in or from that country
"?
I am not prepared to certify this question as the issue has already been dealt with by the Federal Court of Appeal.
[41]
The application for judicial review is therefore dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[42]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed.

.........................
Mesa Soler De Munguia, Ingrid Jasmine (alias Meza Soler De Mungui, Ingrid Jasmine) et Munguia Oqueli, Marco Antonio, Munguia Meza, Andree Anthonioly (alias  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeurs demandent, en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), le contrôle judiciaire d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la Commission), datée du 14 juin 2011, dans laquelle la Commission a statué que les demandeurs n'avaient ni qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention visée à l'article 96 de la Loi ni qualité de personne à protéger visée au paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi. Cette conclusion était fondée sur la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle les demandeurs étaient exposés à un risque généralisé plutôt que personnalisé au Honduras.
[2]
Les demandeurs demandent l'annulation de la décision de la Commission et le renvoi de l'affaire à un tribunal différemment constitué pour nouvelle décision.
Contexte
[3]
La demanderesse principale est Ingrid Jasmine Mesa Soler De Mungui. Les autres demandeurs sont, d'une part, Marco Antonio Munguia Oqueli, son époux, et d'autre part, Andree Anthonioly Munguia Meza, son fils mineur. Les demandeurs sont tous des citoyens du Honduras.
[4]
La demanderesse et son époux détenaient tous deux des emplois bien rémunérés au Honduras. En 2004, des membres du groupe criminel organisé la Mara Salvatrucha (la MS ou la Mara) sont entrés en contact avec eux et leur ont demandé de l'argent. Le gang leur a dit, sous la menace, de ne pas les dénoncer à la police, au sein de laquelle le gang disait avoir de bons contacts.
[5]
Les demandeurs ont d'abord refusé d'accéder aux demandes de la MS. Le gang a donc commencé à persécuter les demandeurs; c'est ainsi qu'elle les a volés, agressés et menacés en mai 2005. Suite à cela, les demandeurs se sont conformés aux demandes du gang.
[6]
En avril 2007, la MS a découvert que les demandeurs gagnaient plus d'argent. Elle leur a donc demandé plus d'argent. Les demandeurs lui ont dit que c'était trop. Cependant, la MS a tout simplement répondu à cela en proférant d'autres menaces à l'endroit des demandeurs. Pour échapper à ces demandes croissantes, les demandeurs ont déménagé dans une autre ville et ont changé de voiture pour dissimuler leur identité. Cependant, en décembre 2008, la MS les a trouvés et les a forcés à payer. En avril 2009, la MS a encore demandé plus d'argent. Les demandeurs ont payé, mais ils ont aussi décidé de quitter le pays pour échapper à cette persécution.
[7]
Les demandeurs ne connaissaient pas le nom des auteurs allégués, et ils n'ont déposé aucune plainte auprès de la police, sauf à une occasion, deux jours avant leur départ du Honduras. Les demandeurs ont déposé cette plainte afin que leurs problèmes soient comptabilisés dans les statistiques du gouvernement. Le lendemain, les demandeurs ont reçu une note affirmant que leur fils serait enlevé s'ils ne versaient pas une grosse somme d'argent.
[8]
Les demandeurs ont quitté le Honduras le 16 août 2009. Ils se sont dirigés vers le Nord en passant par les États-Unis et sont arrivés au Canada le 2 septembre 2009. Ils ont déposé leurs demandes d'asile à la frontière canado-américaine.
[9]
L'audition des demandes d'asile des demandeurs a eu lieu le 9 mai 2011.
La décision de la Commission
[10]
La Commission a rendu sa décision le 14 juin 2011. L'avis de la décision a été communiqué le 13 juillet 2011.
[11]
La Commission a d'abord résumé les allégations des demandeurs. Elle a également accepté les identités des demandeurs tels qu'alléguées.
[12]
La Commission a ensuite examiné la question du lien au regard de l'article 96 de la Loi. Elle a conclu que la crainte des demandeurs n'était liée à aucun des motifs prévus par la Convention, et que les demandeurs étaient plutôt des victimes de la criminalité. La Commission a noté que les victimes de la criminalité n'établissent généralement pas de lien entre leur crainte de persécution et l'un quelconque des motifs prévus par la Convention. Par conséquent, la Commission a rejeté les demandes d'asile des demandeurs en vertu de l'article 96 de la Loi.
[13]
La Commission a ensuite procédé à une analyse au regard de l'article 97, et elle a d'abord noté que les demandeurs avaient quitté le Honduras en entrant aux États-Unis illégalement, pour ensuite venir au Canada, où ils avaient déposé leurs demandes d'asile. Ils n'ont pas déposé leurs demandes aux États-Unis parce que des parents aux États-Unis et au Canada leur ont dit qu'ils avaient plus de chance d'obtenir de l'aide au Canada. Cependant, la Commission a conclu que les personnes craignant avec raison d'être persécutées tenteraient de demander l'asile dans un délai raisonnable. Aussi, leur omission de demander l'asile aux États-Unis indiquait une absence de crainte subjective. Néanmoins, la Commission a noté que cela n'était pas la question déterminante. La question déterminante était plutôt celle de savoir si les demandeurs étaient exposés à un risque généralisé ou personnalisé.
[14]
La Commission a noté que le risque visé au sous-alinéa 97(2)
b
)(ii) de la Loi doit être un risque auquel une personne est exposée personnellement, qui existe en tout lieu du pays, et auquel d'autres personnes ne sont pas généralement exposées. La Commission a examiné la documentation dont elle disposait. Elle a noté que le Honduras était considéré comme un des pays les plus violents d'Amérique latine, où la violence chez les jeunes, les meurtres et les gangs étaient largement répandus. La MS a pris une envergure considérable à la fin des années 1980, elle est bien enracinée, et elle est responsable de nombreux crimes au pays.
[15]
Compte tenu de cet examen, la Commission a conclu que les demandeurs craignaient la MS et les actes criminels du gang qui touchent la population générale au Honduras. Puisqu'ils étaient exposés au même risque que les autres personnes bien nanties se trouvant dans des situations semblables, le risque auquel ils étaient exposés n'était pas un risque personnalisé. La Commission a conclu que la MS s'en était prise aux demandeurs pour les extorquer parce qu'elle croyait qu'ils avaient de l'argent; tout comme la MS s'en prenait à d'autres citoyens bien nantis au Honduras. Le fait que les demandeurs aient été identifiés personnellement comme une cible ne les soustrayait pas nécessairement à une catégorie de personnes exposées à un risque généralisé puisque ce risque était de la nature d'un risque auquel étaient généralement exposées d'autres personnes au pays. Aussi, la Commission a conclu, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le risque allégué par les demandeurs était généralisé. La Commission a donc rejeté la demande des demandeurs en vertu du paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi.
Questions en litige
[16]
Selon les demandeurs, il s'agit de répondre à la question suivante:
La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a conclu que les demandeurs avaient été exposés à un risque généralisé lorsque le gang MS les avait pris personnellement pour cible pour les agresser et les voler, et lorsqu'elle a admis que « [la MS était entrée] en contact avec les demandeurs d'asile afin de leur extorquer de l'argent, à l'instar d'autres habitants du Honduras qui sont dans la même situation qu'eux, c'est-à-dire des gens que [la MS juge] en mesure de [lui] verser de l'argent ».
[17]
Je reformulerais les questions comme suit:
1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle appropriée?
2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son appréciation de la nature du risque auquel étaient exposés les demandeurs au regard du sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii)?
Observations écrites des demandeurs
[18]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que la seule question en litige dans la présente affaire est celle de l'interprétation des mots « d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne [...] sont généralement pas [exposées] »au sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii) de la Loi. Les demandeurs soutiennent que lorsque les principes qui se dégagent de la jurisprudence relative à cette disposition sont appliqués à la présente affaire, il est clair que les demandeurs ont été pris personnellement pour cible pour être assassinés par la MS par suite de leur refus de se faire extorquer. Les demandeurs n'ont pas été exposés à un risque lié à leur emploi ou leur classe économique, mais bien à un risque personnalisé lié à leur refus de se faire extorquer. Aussi, il ne faisait aucun doute que les demandeurs seraient personnellement menacés s'ils étaient renvoyés au Honduras. La Commission a tiré une conclusion manifestement déraisonnable lorsqu'elle a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas qualité de personne à protéger parce qu'ils étaient exposés à un risque généralisé.
Observations écrites du défendeur
[19]
Le défendeur soutient que la question de savoir qu'est-ce qui constitue un risque généralisé au sens du sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii) est une question mixte de fait et de droit qui est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable.
[20]
Le défendeur soutient que la Commission n'a pas commis d'erreur lorsqu'elle a conclu que le risque auquel les demandeurs étaient exposés au Honduras était un risque auquel la population était généralement exposée. Les éléments de preuve documentaire étayaient clairement cette conclusion. En outre, la Commission a bel et bien pris en compte la situation personnelle des demandeurs lorsqu'elle a rendu sa décision.
[21]
Le défendeur soutient également que, bien que les demandeurs aient pu être persécutés pour n'avoir pas accédé aux demandes de la MS, cela ne démontre pas l'existence d'un risque au sens de l'article 97 s'il s'agit d'un risque auquel la population est généralement exposée. Les demandeurs n'ont pas présenté d'éléments de preuve pour démontrer que la conclusion factuelle de la Commission selon laquelle la MS constitue un risque largement répandu pour tous les citoyens était une erreur. En outre, la richesse ne constitue pas un risque personnalisé au sens de l'article 97. Le dossier ne comportait aucun élément de preuve démontrant que les demandeurs étaient exposés à un risque personnalisé.
Analyse et décision
[22]
Première question
Quelle est la norme de contrôle appropriée?
Lorsque la jurisprudence a établi la norme de contrôle applicable à une question particulière, la cour de révision peut adopter cette norme (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 57).
[23]
La question de savoir si un demandeur est exposé à un risque personnalisé, par opposition à un risque généralisé, découle de l'application du sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii) de la Loi et est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 270, aux paragraphes 1, 9 et 11;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 1243, au paragraphe 36; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 1277, au paragraphe 26).
[24]
Lorsqu'elle procède au contrôle de la décision de la Commission selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, la Cour ne doit intervenir que si la Commission est parvenue à une conclusion qui n'est pas transparente, justifiable et intelligible et qui n'appartient pas aux issues acceptables fondées sur la preuve dont la Commission disposait (voir les arrêts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACS no 12, au paragraphe 59). Comme la Cour suprême l'a déclaré dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la cour de révision ne peut substituer à la solution retenue l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable, et il n'entre pas dans les attributions de la cour de révision de soupeser à nouveau les éléments de preuve (aux paragraphes 59 et 61).
[25]
Deuxième question
La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son appréciation de la nature du risque auquel étaient exposés les demandeurs au regard du sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii)?
Suivant l'alinéa 97(1)
b
) de la Loi, les demandeurs peuvent être déclarés des personnes à protéger si leur renvoi les exposerait personnellement à une menace à leur vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités, s'ils ne peuvent ou, de ce fait, ne veulent se réclamer de la protection de l'État. Cette analyse suppose de cerner au cas par cas la menace réelle et particularisée visant le demandeur (voir la décision
Innocent
, précitée, au paragraphe 42). Les victimes de la criminalité ne sont pas considérées comme des personnes à protéger visées à l'article 97 de la Loi pour ce seul motif - la détermination doit être fondée sur les circonstances particulières de chaque cas (voir la décision
Innocent
, précitée, au paragraphe 67).
[26]
En l'espèce, la question déterminante dans la décision de la Commission était celle de savoir si les demandeurs étaient exposés à un risque personnalisé. Compte tenu des éléments de preuve dont elle disposait, la Commission a conclu que ce risque n'était pas personnalisé, mais plutôt généralisé et pesant sur d'autres personnes se trouvant dans des situations semblables au Honduras. Les demandeurs soutiennent que la Commission a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle en est arrivée à cette conclusion parce que leur risque était bel et bien personnalisé. Ce risque découlait de leur refus répété de payer les demandes d'extorsion de la MS, ce qui les différenciait des autres citoyens qui soit n'avaient pas été pris pour cible par la MS, soit avaient accédé à ses demandes.
[27]
Dans sa décision, la Commission a cité une abondante jurisprudence au soutien de sa conclusion selon laquelle le fait que des individus soient persécutés à répétition ou plus fréquemment par des criminels ne personnalisait pas le risque auquel ils étaient exposés s'il s'agissait d'un risque auquel d'autres étaient généralement exposés; particulièrement lorsqu'ils étaient persécutés du fait: qu'ils étaient perçus comme riches; qu'ils habitaient dans une région plus dangereuse; qu'ils étaient poursuivis après s'être adressés à la police ou avoir déménagé; ou qu'ils risquaient de subir des représailles pour avoir refusé d'accéder aux demandes de criminels.
[28]
La jurisprudence citée par la Commission étaye ces conclusions.
[29]
Par exemple, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] ACF no 817, les demandeurs étaient des citoyens fortunés du Honduras. Au paragraphe 25, j'ai statué que:
Les demandeurs sont membres d'un vaste groupe de personnes qui risquent d'être visées par des crimes économiques au Honduras parce qu'ils sont considérés comme riches. Ils font valoir que la Commission a commis une erreur en imposant une norme de contrôle trop stricte et en exigeant qu'ils fassent la preuve qu'ils seraient exposés personnellement à un risque. Compte tenu de la formulation du sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii) de la LIPR, les demandeurs devaient convaincre la Commission qu'ils risquaient d'être personnellement exposés à un risque non partagé par les autres habitants du Honduras. La demande de contrôle judiciaire est donc rejetée.
[30]
De même, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 415, au paragraphe 17 (confirmée en appel:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 143), la juge Danièle Tremblay-Lamer a conclu (au paragraphe 23):
Compte tenu de la jurisprudence récente de la Cour, je suis d'avis que le demandeur n'est pas personnellement exposé à un risque auquel ne sont pas exposés généralement les autres individus qui sont à Haïti ou qui viennent d'Haïti. Le risque d'être visé par quelque forme de criminalité est général et est ressenti par tous les Haïtiens.
Bien qu'un nombre précis d'individus puissent être visés plus fréquemment en raison de leur richesse, tous les Haïtiens risquent de devenir des victimes de violence
. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[31]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 1275, le juge Michael Kelen a expliqué la justification de la conclusion selon laquelle la richesse n'était pas un risque personnalisé (au paragraphe 35):
Je suis d'avis que, si le risque de violence, de préjudice ou de crime constitue un risque généralisé auquel sont exposés l'ensemble des citoyens d'un pays qui sont vus comme étant relativement riches par les criminels, le fait qu'un certain nombre de personnes données puissent être plus fréquemment ciblées en raison de leur richesse ne veut pas dire que ces personnes ne sont pas exposées à un « risque généralisé » de violence. Le fait que les personnes exposées au risque sont celles réputées être relativement riches et peuvent être considérées comme un sous--groupe de la population générale veut dire qu'elles sont exposées à un « risque généralisé ». Que le risque auquel elles sont exposées soit le même que celui d'autres personnes qui sont dans une situation semblable ne fait pas en sorte que ce risque constitue un « risque personnalisé » ouvrant droit à protection en vertu de l'article 97 de la LIPR.
Conclure autrement« ouvrirait toute grande la porte » en ce sens que tous les Guatémaltèques qui sont relativement riches ou réputés être relativement riches pourraient demander l'asile en vertu de l'article 97 de la LIPR.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[32]
Dans la décision
Innocent
, précitée, le juge Robert Mainville a reconnu que:
[...] dans des cas comme l'espèce, où la population en général est exposée à un risque de criminalité, le fait que certaines personnes soient plus exposées à ce risque, soit parce qu'elles habitent des quartiers plus dangereux, soit parce qu'elles sont perçues comme plus riches, ne rend pas ces personnes nécessairement admissibles au statut de personnes à protéger en vertu du sous-alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii). (Au paragraphe 49.)
[33]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 788, le juge Russel Zinn a expliqué qu'un risque ne devient pas personnalisé au seul motif que des victimes déménagent pour échapper à la persécution et sont suivies par leurs persécuteurs (au paragraphe 33):
Je n'accepte pas l'allégation des demandeurs selon laquelle le risque auquel ils étaient exposés est devenu personnalisé lorsque les agents de persécution les ont suivis après avoir déménagé. Un crime ne devient pas personnalisé simplement parce que les criminels, en l'espèce des agents de police du Mexique, suivent leur victime dans une autre région. Le fait que les demandeurs ont été ciblés ne fait pas en sorte que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne sont pas exposées généralement au même risque.
[34]
Enfin, dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF no 23, le demandeur avait été incapable de faire un paiement à un gang criminalisé qui voulait l'extorquer, et il avait été exposé de ce fait à un risque de représailles. Cependant, le juge Pierre Blais a confirmé la décision de la Commission selon laquelle ce risque était généralisé plutôt que personnalisé parce que cette décision était raisonnable compte tenu des éléments de preuve dont la Commission disposait (aux paragraphes 18 et 19). De même, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, la Cour a confirmé la décision de la Commission selon laquelle un chauffeur d'autobus qui avait dénoncé les crimes d'un gang et avait été exposé de ce fait à un risque de représailles avait été exposé à un risque généralisé plutôt que personnalisé, et ce, même si la preuve indiquait notamment que le beau-frère du demandeur avait été assassiné en représailles pour la dénonciation que le demandeur avait faite à la police (au paragraphe 36).
[35]
En l'espèce, tous les éléments énumérés plus haut étaient présents. Les demandeurs adultes détenaient tous deux de bons emplois bien rémunérés et étaient donc tous deux perçus comme riches. À l'audience, la demanderesse principale a admis que ses voisins avaient également été menacés, ce qui porte à croire qu'ils vivaient dans une collectivité où les menaces étaient courantes. Les éléments de preuve présentés par les demandeurs indiquaient également qu'ils avaient été poursuivis après avoir déménagé et que des menaces d'enlèvement avaient été proférées après qu'ils eurent déposé leur plainte auprès de la police. En outre, ils ont affirmé dans leurs témoignages qu'ils craignaient des représailles s'ils étaient renvoyés en raison du fait qu'ils n'avaient pas accédé aux demandes de la MS.
[36]
Compte tenu des éléments de preuve documentaire qui indiquaient que la violence des gangs était largement répandue partout au pays, j'estime que la Commission a conclu raisonnablement que le risque auquel les demandeurs étaient exposés au Honduras était un risque généralisé plutôt que personnalisé. Les éléments de preuve portaient à croire que l'ensemble de la population était généralement exposé au risque d'être victime de la criminalité des gangs, quoique peut-être moins fréquemment (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 1021, au paragraphe 22).
[37]
Cependant, les demandeurs invoquent la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] ACF no 501, au soutien de leur position. Dans cette affaire, le demandeur avait été la cible de tentatives de recrutement par un gang au Salvador. Lorsqu'il avait refusé de se joindre au gang, il avait été menacé à répétition, le foyer familial avait été placé sous surveillance, et le demandeur avait finalement fui son pays. La Commission avait rejeté la demande sur le fondement du témoignage du demandeur selon lequel les gangs de rue faisaient du recrutement partout au pays et visaient toutes les couches de la société, de sorte que le risque auquel le demandeur était exposé était général par opposition à personnel. Pour rendre cette décision, la Commission s'était fiée uniquement au témoignage du demandeur à l'audience, en ne tenant aucun compte des observations formulées dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels selon lesquelles il avait été exposé personnellement à un risque. C'était là que la Commission avait commis une erreur fatale.
[38]
La Cour a souvent distingué l'affaire dont elle était saisie de l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée. Dans la décision
De Parada
, précitée, le juge Zinn a expliqué que le facteur clé qui avait amené la Cour dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à infirmer la décision de la Commission était que la Commission n'avait pas tenu compte du fait que le demandeur avait été pris personnellement pour cible par le gang parce qu'il avait refusé de se joindre à leur cause (au paragraphe 25). Pour distinguer l'affaire
De Parada
de l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, le juge Zinn a expliqué (au paragraphe 25):
Dans la présente affaire, les demandeurs n'ont pas été ciblés personnellement par les MS; ils ont plutôt été ciblés parce qu'ils faisaient partie d'un grand groupe de gens d'affaires considérés comme étant bien nantis. Il s'agit d'un risque généralisé et non d'un risque personnalisé.
[39]
La présente affaire peut elle aussi être distinguée de l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, parce que la Commission a tenu compte de la situation personnelle des demandeurs. La preuve indiquait cependant que le risque auquel ils étaient exposés n'était pas un risque personnalisé mais plutôt un risque plus généralisé en tant que citoyens bien nantis pris pour cible à des fins d'extorsion au Honduras. Compte tenu qu'il y a une fine distinction entre un risque généralisé et un risque personnalisé qui dépend des faits de chaque cas (voir la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 36), je conclus que la Commission en est arrivée à une conclusion raisonnable sur cette question sur le fondement des éléments de preuve dont elle disposait. Je suis donc d'avis de rejeter la présente demande.
[40]
Les demandeurs ont proposé que je certifie la question suivante comme question grave de portée générale:
[Traduction] L'alinéa 97(1)
b
)(ii) de la LIPR oblige la SPR à déterminer si le risque auquel serait exposé le demandeur à son retour est un risque auquel «
d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent [...] sont généralement [...] [exposées
] ». Lorsqu'elle tranche cette question, la SPR commet-elle une erreur si elle tient seulement compte de la
nature
du risque et n'apprécie et n'examine pas aussi la
probabilité
que le demandeur succombe à ce risque, en regard de la probabilité à laquelle sont exposées
« d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent »
?
Je ne suis pas disposé à certifier cette question puisque la Cour d'appel fédérale l'a déjà tranchée.
[41]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire est donc rejetée.

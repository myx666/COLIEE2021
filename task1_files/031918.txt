[1]
Boivin, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review under section 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act
( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ),RSC, 1985, c F-7, and the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
, SC 1992, c 20 ("CCRA"), of certain decisions made by the Correctional Service of Canada ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The applicant is hereby asking the Court to review his security classification and to transfer him to a minimum security institution close to his family.
Factual background
[2]
The applicant is an inmate at the Port-Cartier Institution, a federal maximum security penitentiary in Port-Cartier, Quebec. He has been serving a prison sentence since being convicted of robbery and fraud.
[3]
According to the provisions of the CCRA, a security classification is assigned to all offenders. On July 29, 2009, when the applicant was at the Warkworth Institution in Ontario, the CSC calculated the applicant's security classification using the Security Reclassification Scale. The result was 26 points. Although this result corresponds to a medium security classification, it also falls within the 5% discretionary range that justifies a maximum security classification.
[4]
On August 21, 2009, the applicant's security classification was evaluated by his parole officer at the Warkworth Institution. The following classifications were recommended: a maximum classification for institutional adjustment, a medium classification for escape risk, a maximum classification for risk to public safety and a maximum classification for security level. These recommendations were approved by the warden of the Warkworth Institution.
[5]
On August 26, 2009, the applicant filed a second level grievance with the CSC to challenge the decision on his security classification evaluation.
[6]
On November 30, 2009, a second level grievance decision was issued, confirming the applicant's maximum security classification.
[7]
On January 8, 2010, the applicant filed a third level grievance with the CSC.
[8]
A few months after he filed his third level grievance, the applicant contacted the Office of the Correctional Investigator Canada to enquire about the status of his third level grievance.
[9]
In a letter dated July 12, 2010, Sofia Gutierrez, an investigator with the Office of the Correctional Investigator (a distinct government branch from the CSC), wrote to the applicant to inform him that she had contacted the Offender Redress Division at National Headquarters to find out why it was taking so long to respond. Ms. Gutierrez wrote in her letter that there had been a policy breach in the processing of the applicant's grievance.
[10]
In a letter dated August 19, 2010, the CSC's Offender Redress Division (National Headquarters) acknowledged receipt of the applicant's third level grievance and informed him that a response would be sent no later than December 13, 2010.
[11]
During the week of August 20, 2010, the applicant filed an application for judicial review with the Federal Court. The application was received on August 25, 2010. The main goals of his application were a review of his maximum security classification and a transfer to a minimum security institution close to his family.
[12]
On September 24, 2010, the applicant received a letter from the Executive Director and General Counsel of the Office of the Correctional Investigator, Ivan Zinger. In his letter, Mr. Zinger acknowledged the delay in responding to the applicant's grievance. He explained that the applicant's situation was [translation] "much too common and [that] delays in processing complaints and grievances by Canada's correctional system are a systemic problem".
[13]
On October 8, 2010, the respondent wrote to the applicant to again explain that CSC would be deciding on his third level grievance before December 13, 2010.
[14]
On December 10, 2010, the CSC issued a third level decision concerning the applicant's grievance. The applicant's grievance was allowed in part. The applicant received a copy of the decision on December 13, 2010.
[15]
On December 21, 2010, the respondent wrote the applicant a letter, reminding him that the CSC had made a decision concerning his third level grievance and asking him to withdraw his application for judicial review before January 15, 2011. In that letter, the respondent informed the applicant that his application had become moot.
[16]
Since the applicant's application for judicial review was not withdrawn, the respondent filed a motion to strike the notice of application on February 28, 2011. On March 22, 2011, Justice Martineau issued an order dismissing the respondent's motion to strike. Justice Martineau indicated that he was not satisfied that the application for judicial review had become completely academic, noting that a tangible and concrete dispute still seemed to exist.
[17]
On April 27, 2011, the applicant's security classification was reduced to medium, and the applicant read this decision on May 2, 2011.
[18]
On June 20, 2011, the applicant submitted a request to be transferred from the Port-Cartier Institution to the Archambault Institution. This request is currently being processed.
[19]
The applicant did not file a new application for judicial review of the third level decision issued on December 10, 2010.
Issues
[20]
Several issues have been raised. Essentially, the Court finds that the following questions are relevant in this case:
1.
Has the application for judicial review become moot or academic? If the answer to this question is no:
2.
Is the application for judicial review interlocutory?
3. Can the applicant use the present application for judicial review, which was filed on August 25, 2010, to challenge the second level grievance response issued on November 30, 2009 or the third level grievance response issued on December 10, 2010?
Relevant legislation
[21]
The relevant legislation is reproduced in Appendix A.
Analysis
1. Has the application for judicial review become moot or academic?
[22]
The applicant alleges that even though the respondent replied to his third level grievance on December 10, 2010, there is still an issue to be resolved (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  176 FTR 252). He submits that he waited 11 months for a response and that the CSC grievance system does not work. The applicant also refers to Justice Martineau's order regarding the motion to strike dated March 22, 2011, in which the judge stated that a tangible and concrete issue remained to be resolved.
[23]
The respondent cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and submits that the present application is moot since the CSC issued a response to the third level grievance on December 10, 2010. The respondent also argues that judicial review before the Federal Court is not the appropriate medium for settling all of the applicant's grievances.
[24]
The Court points out that in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada developed the mootness doctrine. Essentially, the Supreme Court of Canada discussed the parameters of a practice that allows a court to decline to decide a case which raises merely a hypothetical or abstract question. A controversy must exist not only when the application for judicial review is instituted, but also at any other moment during the proceeding. Consequently, an issue can become moot if it is resolved as the result of events occurring during the course of the judicial review.
[25]
The approach involves two steps. First it is necessary to determine whether the required tangible and concrete dispute has disappeared and the issues have become academic. Second, if the response to the first question is affirmative, it is necessary to decide if the court should exercise its discretion to hear the case.
[26]
At the second stage, three factors must be considered to determine whether the Court is able to exercise its discretion: (i) the existence of the adversarial system; (ii) judicial economy; and (iii) the need for courts to demonstrate some sensitivity to the effectiveness or efficacy of judicial intervention and to be aware of the judiciary's role in our political framework.
[27]
After having read the applicant's application for judicial review and heard the parties, the Court is of the view that, in his application, the applicant is actually seeking a mandamus. In fact, the applicant's application is not concerned with any particular decision but rather with compelling National Headquarters to issue a decision regarding his third level grievance:
[translation]
This is the purpose of my application for judicial review. I filed a third level grievance in January 2010 (Reference No.V40A00034617), which was given to the warden, Théresa Westfall, to challenge my security classification, which was 23.5 at the 2009-08-07 evaluation (sic) the score was 23.5; however, I never received a response. (Applicant's Record, p. 2)
[28]
In light of the principles described, the Court finds that the applicant's application has become moot since the CSC issued a response to the applicant's third level grievance in December 2010, thus resolving the issue. The Court also finds that the applicant did not exhaust all internal remedies before filing his application for judicial review and that there are no exceptional circumstances (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 367). In that sense, the present application for judicial review is interlocutory.
[29]
The Court also notes that at no point did the applicant amend his notice of application for judicial review or directly challenge the third level decision issued in December 2010. The Court furthermore notes that the applicant's classification was reduced to medium on April 27, 2011.
[30]
The fact that the application is academic and moot is enough to dispose of the matter. The Court therefore does not have to deal with questions 2 and 3. The Court will deal nonetheless with certain questions discussed at the hearing in the hope that this will be useful for the parties.
[31]
First, it should be noted that the CCRA, the
Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations
(the Regulations) and Commissioner's Directive No. 81,
Offender Complaints and Grievances
(CD 081) (Appendix A) introduce a comprehensive grievance process in the corrections system.
[32]
Specifically, under section 27 of CD 081, the complaint and grievance process includes four levels: written complaints, first level grievances, second level grievances and third level grievances. Section 30 of CD 081 provides that grievers can apply for judicial review of the final decision with the Federal Court under subsection 18.1(2) of the
Federal Courts Act
.
[33]
The Court also points out that the case law demonstrates that, in principle, a person can turn to the courts but only after having exhausted all possible remedies available in the administrative process. As a general rule, therefore, judicial review should not be allowed where an adequate alternative remedy exists (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[34]
The doctrine of exhaustion was recently clearly described by the Federal Court of Appeal in
C.B. Powell Ltd
(above). The Federal Court of Appeal reiterated that, to prevent fragmentation of the administrative process and piecemeal court proceedings, absent exceptional circumstances, parties cannot proceed to the court system until the administrative process has run its course and has finished. The Federal Court of Appeal also confirmed that very few circumstances qualify as "exceptional".
[35]
In his application for judicial review, the applicant in fact admits that he did not exhaust the CSC grievance process because he wanted to obtain a response to his grievance. He alleges that the CSC took too much time to render a decision. At the hearing, the parties referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In the Court's opinion, these decisions do not apply to the facts of the present matter, for the following reasons.
[36]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant had every reason to believe that, given the difficulties he had experienced at the second level of the grievance resolution procedure, it was likely that he would not receive a quick response at the third level. In that case, the applicant had received a decision at the second level. He had then applied for judicial review within the required timeframe, namely, within 30 days of the decision (subsection 18.1(2) of the
Federal Courts Act
). After hearing the case on its merits, the Court dismissed the application for judicial review. The facts raised in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> do not apply in the present matter because the second level decision was issued within a reasonable timeframe; the application for judicial does not concern the second level decision; and the goal of the application filed by the applicant in the present case was to accelerate the third level decision.
[37] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> involved an application for judicial review of a refusal to re-evaluate the classification of the inmate in question and to transfer him. In that case, the Court found that, in light of evidence indicating that the CSC had not acted independently and that other government agencies had dictated its decisions, the circumstances warranted an exception to the general rule that internal remedies should be exhausted beforehand. Consequently, the Court determined that the application for judicial review was appropriate. However, in the case at bar, the evidence does not demonstrate that the CSC was influenced by another agency and, consequently, did not act independently. The decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> therefore does not apply in the present matter.
[38]
The Court nonetheless observes that, in light of the record, and this despite there being some mitigating factors, the CSC did not comply with its own policy described in CD 081 in terms of its analysis and processing of the applicant's third level grievance (letter from Sofia Gutierrez, Investigator, Officer of the Correctional Investigator, July 12, 1010; letter from Ivan Zinger, Executive Director and General Counsel, Office of the Correctional Investigator, September 24, 2010).
[39]
In sum, and in light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the applicant cannot use the present application for judicial review to challenge the response to the second level grievance dated November 30, 2009, or the response to the third level grievance dated December 10, 2010.
[40]
The application for judicial review filed by the applicant is moot and academic. It will therefore be dismissed.
[41]
Given the result, costs would normally follow the event and be awarded to the respondent. Even though this issue has become moot and academic, it once again highlights certain deficiencies in the processing of inmates' complaints. In these circumstances, the Court will exercise its discretion and make no order as to costs.
JUDGMENT
[42]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
the application for judicial review be dismissed, without costs.

.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  en vertu de l'article 18.1 de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
(« LCF »), LRC, 1985, ch F-7, et de la
Loi sur le système correctionnel et la mise en liberté sous condition
, LC 1992, ch 20 (« LSCMLC »), visant certaines décisions prises par le Service correctionnel du Canada (« SCC »). Par la présente, le demandeur demande à cette Cour de réviser sa cote de sécurité et de le transférer à un établissement de sécurité de niveau minimum situé près de sa famille.
Le contexte factuel
[2]
Le demandeur est un détenu incarcéré à l'Établissement de Port-Cartier, un pénitencier fédéral à sécurité maximale situé à Port-Cartier au Québec. Il purge une peine d'emprisonnement, après avoir été reconnu coupable de vol qualifié et de fraude.
[3]
Selon les dispositions de la LSCMLC, une cote de classement est assignée à tous les délinquants. Le 29 juillet 2009, au moment où le demandeur se trouvait à l'Établissement de Warkworth en Ontario, le SCC a calculé la cote de sécurité du demandeur selon l'Échelle de réévaluation. Le résultat obtenu était de 26 points. Bien que ce résultat corresponde à une cote de sécurité moyenne, ce résultat se situe également dans la fourchette discrétionnaire de 5% qui justifie un niveau de sécurité maximal.
[4]
La cote de sécurité du demandeur a par la suite été évaluée par son Agent de libération conditionnelle à l'Établissement Warkworth le 21 août 2009. Les cotes suivantes sont recommandées: la cote élevée pour l'adaptation à l'établissement, la cote moyenne pour le risque d'évasion, la cote élevée pour le risque pour la sécurité du public et la cote élevée pour le niveau de sécurité. Ces recommandations sont approuvées par le directeur de l'Établissement Warkworth.
[5]
Le 26 août 2009, le demandeur dépose un grief de deuxième palier auprès du SCC pour contester la décision sur l'évaluation de sa cote de sécurité.
[6]
Le 30 novembre 2009, une décision au deuxième palier des griefs est rendue et confirme la cote de sécurité élevée du demandeur.
[7]
Le 8 janvier 2010, le demandeur dépose un grief de troisième palier auprès du SCC.
[8]
Quelques mois après le dépôt de son grief de troisième palier, le demandeur communique avec le bureau de l'enquêteur correctionnel du Canada afin de connaître l'état de son grief de troisième palier.
[9]
Dans une lettre datée du 12 juillet 2010, Madame Sofia Gutierrez, enquêteuse avec le bureau de l'Enquêteur correctionnel (une branche gouvernementale distincte du SCC), écrit au demandeur pour l'informer qu'elle a communiqué avec le Bureau des Recours des délinquants de l'administration centrale afin de comprendre les raisons expliquant la longueur du délai de réponse. Madame Gutierrez note dans sa lettre qu'il existe un bris de politique quant au traitement du grief du demandeur.
[10]
Dans une lettre en date du 19 août 2010, la Division des Recours des délinquants du SCC (l'Administration centrale) accuse réception du grief de troisième palier du demandeur et l'informe qu'une réponse sera transmise le ou avant le 13 décembre 2010.
[11]
Pendant la semaine du 20 août 2010, le demandeur dépose une demande de contrôle judiciaire auprès de la Cour fédérale. Cette demande est reçue le 25 août 2010. L'objet principal de la demande vise la révision de sa cote de sécurité fixée au niveau maximal et un transfert à un établissement de sécurité minimum près de sa famille.
[12]
Le 24 septembre 2010, le demandeur reçoit une lettre du Directeur exécutif et avocat général du bureau de l'Enquêteur correctionnel, Me Ivan Zinger. Dans sa lettre, Me Zinger écrit qu'il note le délai de réponse au grief soumis par le demandeur. Il explique que la situation du demandeur est « beaucoup trop courante et les délais de traitement des plaintes et griefs par le Système correctionnel du Canada constituent un problème systémique ».
[13]
Le 8 octobre 2010, le défendeur écrit au demandeur pour expliquer de nouveau que le SCC allait rendre une décision relative à son grief au troisième palier avant le 13 décembre 2010.
[14]
Le 10 décembre 2010, le SCC rend une décision au troisième palier relative au grief du demandeur. Le grief du demandeur a été maintenu en partie. Le demandeur a reçu une copie de cette décision le 13 décembre 2010.
[15]
Le 21 décembre 2010, le défendeur écrit une lettre au demandeur lui rappelant que le SCC a rendu une décision concernant son grief au troisième palier et lui demande de retirer sa demande de contrôle judiciaire avant le 15 janvier 2011. Dans cette lettre, le défendeur informe le demandeur que sa demande est devenue théorique.
[16]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire du demandeur n'ayant pas été retirée, le défendeur dépose une requête en radiation de l'avis de demande de contrôle judiciaire le 28 février 2011. Le 22 mars 2011, le juge Martineau émet une ordonnance rejetant la requête en radiation du défendeur. Le juge Martineau indique qu'il n'est pas convaincu que la demande de contrôle judiciaire est devenue entièrement académique et constate qu'il semble encore exister un différend tangible et concret à trancher.
[17]
Le 27 avril 2011, la cote de sécurité du demandeur est réduite au niveau moyen et le demandeur prend connaissance de cette décision le 2 mai 2011.
[18]
Le 20 juin 2011, le demandeur soumet une demande de transfert de l'Établissement Port-Cartier à l'Établissement Archambault. Cette demande est présentement en traitement.
[19]
Le demandeur n'a soumis aucune nouvelle demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision de troisième palier rendue le 10 décembre 2010.
Les questions en litige
[20]
Plusieurs questions en litige ont été soulevées. Essentiellement, la Cour estime que les questions pertinentes en l'espèce sont les suivantes:
1. Est-ce que la demande de contrôle judiciaire est devenue théorique ou académique? Si la réponse à cette question est négative:
2. Est-ce que la demande de contrôle judiciaire est interlocutoire?
3. Est-ce que le demandeur peut utiliser la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire qui était déposée le 25 août 2010 pour contester la réponse au deuxième palier rendue le 30 novembre 2009 ou la réponse au troisième palier du grief rendue le 10 décembre 2010?
La législation pertinente
[21]
La législation pertinente est reproduite à l'annexe A.
L'analyse
1. Est-ce que la demande de contrôle judiciaire est devenue théorique ou académique ?
[22]
Le demandeur allègue que même si le défendeur a répondu à son grief de troisième palier le 10 décembre 2010 il existe toujours une problématique à trancher ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> c
.
Canada (Procureur général)
, [2000] ACF no 103, 176 FTR 252). Il soutient qu'il a attendu onze (11) mois pour une réponse et que le système de griefs du SCC ne fonctionne pas. Le demandeur réfère également à l'ordonnance du juge Martineau relatif à la requête en radiation du 22 mars 2011 dans laquelle ce dernier mentionne qu'il existe toujours une problématique tangible et concrète à trancher.
[23]
Pour sa part, le défendeur soulève l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , et avance que la présente demande est théorique puisque le SCC a émis une réponse au grief de troisième palier le 10 décembre 2010. En outre, le défendeur soutient que le contrôle judiciaire devant la Cour fédérale n'est pas le forum approprié pour régler tous les griefs du demandeur.
[24]
La Cour rappelle que dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada a élaboré la doctrine relative au caractère théorique d'une demande (« mootness doctrine »). Essentiellement, la Cour suprême du Canada a discuté des paramètres de cette pratique qui permet à un tribunal de refuser de trancher des différends lorsque ces derniers soulèvent des questions purement hypothétiques ou abstraites. Une polémique doit exister, non seulement au moment où la demande de contrôle judiciaire est instituée, mais aussi à tout autre moment durant le litige. En conséquence, un différend peut devenir sans objet si certains événements viennent régler le litige au cours du processus de contrôle judiciaire.
[25]
La démarche à suivre se divise en deux temps. En premier lieu, il faut se demander si le différend concret et tangible a disparu et si la question est devenue purement théorique. En deuxième lieu, si la réponse à la première question est affirmative, le tribunal décide s'il doit exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire et entendre l'affaire.
[26]
À cette deuxième étape, trois facteurs doivent être considérés afin de déterminer si le tribunal est en mesure d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire: (i) l'existence du système contradictoire; (ii) l'économie des ressources judiciaires; et (iii) la nécessité pour les tribunaux d'être sensibles à l'efficacité et à l'efficience de l'intervention judiciaire et d'être conscients de leur fonction juridictionnelle dans notre structure politique.
[27]
Après avoir lu la demande de contrôle judiciaire du demandeur et entendu les parties, la Cour est d'avis que le but recherché par la demande de contrôle judiciaire est en fait de l'ordre du mandamus. En effet, la demande du demandeur ne vise aucune décision en particulier mais vise plutôt à forcer l'administration à rendre une décision relativement à son grief de troisième palier:
« Voilà l'objet de ma demande de contrôle judiciaire. J'ai déposé un grief du troisième palier en janvier 2010 référence (V40A00034617) qui a été remis à la directrice Théresa Westfall afin de contester ma cote de sécurité qui était 23,5 évaluation du 2009-08-07 le score était 23.5, or, je n'ai jamais reçu de réponse. (Dossier du demandeur, p. 2)
[28]
À la lumière des principes qui précèdent, la Cour estime que la demande du demandeur est devenue théorique puisque le SCC a rendu une réponse au grief de troisième palier du demandeur en décembre 2010 réglant ainsi le litige. La Cour estime aussi que le demandeur n'a pas épuisé ses recours internes avant d'introduire sa demande de contrôle judiciaire et qu'il n'existe aucune circonstance exceptionnelle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 367). En ce sens, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est interlocutoire.
[29]
La Cour prend note également que le demandeur n'a, en aucun temps, amendé son avis de demande de contrôle judiciaire ou contesté directement la décision de troisième palier rendue en décembre 2010. La Cour note de plus que la cote du demandeur a été réduite le 27 avril 2011 à un niveau moyen.
[30]
L'aspect académique et théorique de cette affaire suffit pour en disposer. La Cour n'a donc pas à traiter des questions 2 et 3. Ceci étant, certaines questions ont été discutées lors de l'audience et la Cour les abordera en espérant que cet exercice se révèle utile pour les parties.
[31]
Tout d'abord, il convient d'indiquer que la LSCMLC, le
Règlement sur le système correctionnel et la mise en liberté sous condition
(le « Règlement ») et la
Directive du Commissaire 081: Plaintes et griefs des délinquants
(la « DC 081 ») (annexe A) introduisent un processus compréhensif de résolution de griefs dans le contexte correctionnel.
[32]
Plus particulièrement, en vertu de l'article 27 de la DC 081, le processus de règlement des plaintes et griefs comprend quatre paliers: plaintes écrites, griefs au premier palier, griefs au deuxième palier et griefs au troisième palier. L'article 30 de la DC 081, prévoit qu'un plaignant peut soumettre une demande de révision judiciaire d'une décision finale à la Cour fédérale conformément au paragraphe 18.1(2) de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
.
[33]
Cette Cour rappelle aussi que la jurisprudence démontre, qu'en principe, une personne peut s'adresser aux tribunaux judiciaires mais seulement après avoir épuisé tous les recours possibles selon le processus administratif. Donc, règle générale, le contrôle judiciaire ne devrait pas être autorisé lorsqu'un autre recours approprié existe (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[34]
La doctrine de l'épuisement des recours a récemment été clairement énoncée par la Cour d'appel fédérale dans
C.B. Powell Ltd
. (ci-dessus). La Cour d'appel fédérale a réitéré qu'à défaut de circonstances exceptionnelles les parties ne peuvent s'adresser aux tribunaux tant que le processus administratif suit son cours et qu'il n'a pas atteint son terme afin d'éviter le fractionnement du processus administratif et le morcellement du processus judiciaire. La Cour d'appel fédérale a également confirmé que très peu de circonstances peuvent être qualifiées d'« exceptionnelles ».
[35]
Dans sa demande de contrôle judiciaire, le demandeur admet dans les faits qu'il n'a pas épuisé le processus de griefs de la SCC puisqu'il voulait obtenir une réponse à son grief. Il allègue que le SCC prend trop de temps pour rendre sa décision. Lors de l'audience, les affaires
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ont été mentionnées par les parties. La Cour est d'opinion que ces deux décisions ne s'appliquent pas aux faits de la présente cause pour les raisons qui suivent.
[36]
Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le demandeur avait tous les motifs de croire que compte tenu des difficultés qui avaient eu cours au deuxième palier de la procédure de règlement des griefs, il se pouvait qu'il n'obtienne pas rapidement une réponse au troisième palier. Dans ce cas, le demandeur avait reçu sa décision du deuxième palier. Il avait ensuite déposé une demande de contrôle judiciaire dans le délai requis, soit dans les trente (30) jours de la décision (art. 18.1 (2) de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
). Après avoir entendu l'affaire au fond, la Cour a rejeté la demande de contrôle judiciaire. Les faits évoqués dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ne s'appliquent pas en l'espèce puisque la décision du deuxième palier a été rendue dans des délais raisonnables; la demande de contrôle judiciaire ne vise pas la décision du deuxième palier; et, la demande visée par le demandeur en l'espèce visait à accélérer la décision du troisième palier.
[37]
L'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> concernait le cas d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire du refus de réévaluer la cote et de transférer le détenu en question. Dans cette affaire, la Cour a conclu que, face à un élément de preuve qui indiquait que le SCC n'avait pas agi de façon indépendante et que d'autres organismes gouvernementaux avaient dicté ses décisions, les circonstances justifiaient une dérogation à la règle générale relative à l'épuisement préalable des recours internes. Par conséquent, la Cour a jugé que la demande de contrôle judiciaire était appropriée. Toutefois, dans le cas qui nous occupe, la preuve ne démontre pas que le SCC a été influencé par un organisme et, partant, qu'il n'aurait pas agi de façon indépendante. La décision dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ne s'applique donc pas à la présente affaire.
[38]
La Cour observe toutefois qu'à la lumière du dossier, et ce, bien qu'il existe certains facteurs atténuants, le SCC ne s'est pas conformé à sa propre politique décrite dans la DC 081 en ce qui concerne l'analyse et le traitement du grief de troisième palier du demandeur (lettre de Madame Sofia Gutierrez, Enquêteuse avec le bureau de l'Enquêteur correctionnel, 12 juillet 2010; lettre de Me Ivan Zinger, Directeur exécutif et avocat général de l'Enquêteur correctionnel, 24 septembre 2010).
[39]
Somme toute, et, à la lumière de ce qui précède, la Cour conclut que le demandeur ne peut utiliser la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire pour contester ni la réponse au grief de deuxième palier rendue le 30 novembre 2009, ni la réponse au grief de troisième palier du grief rendue le 10 décembre 2010.
[40]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée par le demandeur est théorique et académique. Elle sera donc rejetée.
[41]
Compte tenu du résultat, les dépens devraient normalement suivre l'issue de la cause et seraient adjugés au défendeur. Bien que cette cause soit devenue académique et théorique, elle met en relief une fois de plus certaines lacunes dans le traitement des plaintes des détenus. Dans ces circonstances, la Cour exercera son pouvoir discrétionnaire et n'adjugera pas de dépens.

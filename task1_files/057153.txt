 Zinn, J. 
 : The Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada [ID] found the Applicant inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 [ 
 IRPA 
 ] for being a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in terrorism, and also inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(a) of  
 IRPA 
  for being complicit in the commission of crimes against humanity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The Minister concedes that the decision of the judicial review should be granted with respect to the ID's finding that the Applicant is inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(a) of  
 IRPA 
  due to the failure to determine whether the Applicant made a voluntary, significant and knowing contribution to any crime or criminal purpose as is now required following the decision of the Supreme Court in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [ 
 Ezokola 
 ].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Therefore, the only issue is whether the ID's decision is reasonable with respect to whether the Applicant was a member of an organization for which there are reasonable grounds to believe, engaged in acts of terrorism. The outcome turns on whether or not it was reasonable for the ID to find that membership in the Tamil National Alliance [TNA], a political party, was tantamount to being a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  The Applicant is a citizen of Sri Lanka, born in 1932. He was and admits to having been a member of the TNA. He joined the TNA in 2002 and served as a TNA-appointed Member of Parliament from 2004-2007. Members of the TNA, including himself, occasionally attended meetings and lunches organized by the LTTE. LTTE members also attended rallies and meetings held by the TNA. The Applicant had met with LTTE leaders several times both before, and while he was with the TNA. He knew that the LTTE used violent means to achieve their goals, and does not dispute that the LTTE committed acts of terrorism and crimes against humanity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  The Applicant says that during his time with the TNA, he was not sure whether the LTTE's actions could be considered crimes against humanity because he had reason to doubt the accuracy of reporting by the Government of Sri Lanka, and he also believed, based on international law, that an oppressed people could legitimately take up arms against their oppressors, although this was not a method he personally supported.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The Applicant says that he has a history of advocacy through non-violent means. He joined the Ilankai Tamil Arasuk Kachchi [ITAK], whose leader believed in furtherance of Tamil rights by non-violent, political means. In 1979, he was detained for speaking out against the government. He was eventually released because the government determined it could not justify charging him based on his ardent belief in non-violent means.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  In 1980, he joined the Tamil Eelam Liberation Front [TELF] which was an open-operation movement devoted to non-violent political change. In 2000, he became involved with the TNA. In 2002, peace talks began between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The Applicant came to Canada in early August 2009 and filed a claim for refugee protection claiming fear for his life due to the rise in murders of Tamil activists in Sri Lanka. The ID found that, by virtue of his membership with the TNA, the Applicant was in fact a member of the LTTE.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  The Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal have consistently held that the concept of "membership" must be interpreted broadly:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  After the release of  
 Ezokola 
 , Justice O'Reilly in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 1171 (QL), stated at paras 14-15 that it was his view that "membership" should be read more narrowly in light of  
 Ezokola 
 . However, as the Respondent points out, Justice O'Reilly does not provide any reasons for this finding, and his statement is in obiter. Moreover, Justice Strickland in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2014] FCJ No 79 (QL) [ 
 Nassereddine 
 ] found his view to be contrary to prior jurisprudence. I agree with Justice Strickland that  
 Ezokola 
  does not change the test for admissibility pursuant to paragraph 34(1)(f) of  
 IRPA 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
   
 Ezokola 
  dealt with section 98 of  
 IRPA 
 , which excludes refugee protection for those who fall under Articles 1E and 1F of the Refugee Convention. Neither article deals with membership in a terrorist organization:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 E. This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  While section 98 of  
 IRPA 
  is concerned with international criminal culpability, paragraph 34(1)(f) of  
 IRPA 
  is concerned with national security, and in this respect, Parliament has seen fit to make membership in an organization that has engaged in acts of terrorism sufficient to render a person inadmissible to Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The Federal Court of Appeal has determined that it is not a requirement for inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(f) of  
 IRPA 
  that the dates of an individual's membership in the organization correspond with the dates on which that organization committed acts of terrorism or subversion by force:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1312 (QL). The Applicant emphasizes that at the time that he was a member of parliament, the LTTE was engaged in peace talks with the Sri Lankan government. This is irrelevant because the LTTE  
 at some point 
  was engaged in terrorist activities; it does not matter that the Applicant may not have been a member when those activities were occurring. Regardless, evidence in the record indicates that during the elections in 2004 (at the time that the Applicant was a member of the TNA), the LTTE continued to use tactics such as intimidation and murder to forward their goals.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Further, it is irrelevant whether or not the Applicant was in any way involved with the LTTE's activities as paragraph 34(1)(f) of  
 IRPA 
  is not a determination as to complicity. If the ID's finding that the TNA is effectively the same organization as the LTTE is reasonable, it is sufficient for the purposes of paragraph 34(1)(f) that the Applicant was a member of the TNA. I turn then to the nature of the TNA.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The Applicant testified that in his view, the TNA was collaborating with the LTTE, but they were operating in parallel; the TNA was not a proxy for the LTTE. He also testified that at no time in his service as a member of parliament did he ever receive directives from the LTTE, nor did the TNA have any involvement in the activities of the LTTE.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  He testified that he personally believed in a non-violent struggle, but that the LTTE's (violent) actions were inevitable. While he supported the same end goal of the liberation of Tamils, he never considered himself a member of the LTTE. He never raised support, either financial or otherwise for the LTTE and never endorsed their use of violence to forward their agenda.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  The Applicant's own stance may have been a peaceful one; however one must consider, as the ID did, the documentary evidence in the record which indicates that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (i) The LTTE campaigned for the TNA in 2004;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (ii) The LTTE worked to sabotage the 2004 elections in order to ensure that the TNA would secure seats in parliament by intimidating members of opposing parties;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (iii) Members of the TNA were themselves involved in the violence and intimidation;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (iv) Candidates from the TNA were screened and approved by the LTTE to help the LTTE achieve its own goals, or were active members of the LTTE;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (v) Some members of the TNA were of the view that "the LTTE is ours and we are LTTE-ers" (CTR at p 490);  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (vi) Members of the TNA who were not avid supporters of the LTTE were sidelined and snubbed by LTTE leadership and kept in the dark regarding certain decisions;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (vii) The TNA is subservient to the LTTE; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (viii) The TNA "explicitly served as the proxy of the LTTE. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 In my view, this constitutes evidence that reasonably grounds the ID's conclusion that the TNA was subservient to, or equivalent to the LTTE.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  The Applicant submits that the ID erred:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. In failing to give context to the TNA's expressions of support for the LTTE: at the time, the TNA was advocating acceptance of the LTTE as the only legitimate representative of the Tamil people in the context of peace talks with the Sri Lankan government;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. In not considering whether members of the TNA had any involvement in the LTTE activities;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. By ignoring that claims that the TNA was created by the LTTE originated from opposing parties;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. In failing to appreciate that references to the LTTE in the TNA's 2004 Election Manifesto were made in the context of encouraging peace talks between the LTTE and the government, and that the TNA called for the "immediate cessation of the war being currently waged in the northeast"; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 5. Failing to consider statements in the TNA's 2004 Election Manifesto that specifically identified political solutions to the Tamil national problem.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  In my view, the Applicant has not identified any specific evidence that contradicts or brings into serious question the ID's finding that the TNA was intimately related to the LTTE. That the TNA may have supported the LTTE in the context of encouraging peace talks, or had a peaceful political agenda, does not undermine the evidence that the LTTE supported the TNA through intimidation and murder during the 2004 elections. It also does not undermine the evidence that members of the TNA viewed themselves equally as members of the LTTE, that the LTTE vetted candidates of the TNA, and that some members of the TNA (albeit not the Applicant) were  
 themselves 
  engaged in violent acts against opposing parties.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  While it is true that the evidence relating to the LTTE's involvement in the creation of the TNA came predominantly from members of opposing parties, there is independent evidence from the "Political Handbook of the World: 2005-2006" by CQ Press (A Division of Congressional Quarterly Inc.), that the TNA "explicitly served as the proxy of the LTTE. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [21] 
  The legitimate goals of an organization may be a factor to be considered in cases under section 98 or 35, where international criminal culpability through complicity is at issue, and the Supreme Court of Canada's comments  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  are instructive; however, that is not a factor to be considered under section 34. The statutory language is explicit: an applicant is inadmissible for being a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, or  
 has engaged 
  in acts of terrorism. That there may have been legitimate objectives or agendas is an irrelevant consideration.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  In this case, there was sufficient evidence to support the ID's conclusion that the LTTE was sufficiently connected with the TNA such that membership in the TNA was tantamount to membership in the LTTE. The decision is therefore reasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  The Applicant proposed that a question be certified that is the same as or similar to that certified by Justice Strickland  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . In that case, the Minister proposed the question. In this case, the Minister opposes the certification of any question. In my view, it is appropriate to certify the following question:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , change the existing legal test for assessing membership in terrorist organizations, for the purposes of assessing inadmissibility under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, 
  SC 2001, c 27?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 JUDGMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
   
 THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that 
 :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. The application for judicial review is allowed, in part;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. The decision of the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada finding that the Applicant is inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(a) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 is quashed;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. The decision of the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada finding that the Applicant is inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 is not set aside as it is found to be reasonable;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. The following question is certified pursuant to paragraph 74(d) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , change the existing legal test for assessing membership in terrorist organizations, for the purposes of assessing inadmissibility under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the

 Le juge Zinn 
  [Traduction]: La Section de l'immigration de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [SI] a conclu que le demandeur était interdit de territoire en application de l'alinéa 34(1) 
 f 
 ) de la  
 Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés 
 , LC 2001, c 27 [LIPR], au motif qu'il était membre d'une organisation dont il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'elle se livre, s'est livrée ou se livrera au terrorisme, et de l'alinéa 35(1) 
 a 
 ) de la LIPR, parce qu'il s'était rendu complice de la perpétration de crimes contre l'humanité.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Le ministre admet que la décision relative au contrôle judiciaire devrait être accueillie à l'égard à la conclusion de la SI selon laquelle le demandeur est interdit de territoire en application de l'alinéa 35(1) 
 a 
 ) de la LIPR parce qu'elle n'a pas cherché à savoir si le demandeur avait fait une contribution à la fois volontaire, consciente et significative à un crime ou à un dessein criminel, comme il est maintenant requis depuis l'arrêt  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , [ 
 Ezokola 
 ] de la Cour suprême du Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Par conséquent, la seule question en l'espèce est celle de savoir si la décision de la SI est raisonnable pour ce qui est de savoir si le demandeur était membre d'une organisation dont il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'elle se livrait à des activités terroristes. Il s'agit de déterminer s'il était raisonnable ou non de la part de la SI de conclure que l'appartenance au parti politique l'Alliance nationale tamoule [TNA] équivalait au statut de membre des Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul [TLET].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  Le demandeur est un citoyen du Sri Lanka, né en 1932. Il a été membre de la TNA et admet l'avoir été. Il a adhéré à la TNA en 2002 et, de 2004 à 2007, a été député désigné par la TNA. Des membres de la TNA, dont le demandeur, assistaient à l'occasion à des réunions et des dîners organisés par les TLET. Les membres des TLET assistaient aussi à des rassemblements et à des réunions organisés par la TNA. Le demandeur avait rencontré les chefs des TLET plusieurs fois pendant qu'il était membre de la TNA et avant de l'être. Il savait que les TLET avaient recours à des moyens violents pour atteindre leurs buts, et il ne conteste pas le fait que les TLET ont commis des actes de terrorisme et des crimes contre l'humanité.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Le demandeur témoigne qu'au cours de la période pendant laquelle il était membre de la TNA, il ne savait pas si les actions des TLET pouvaient être considérées comme étant des crimes contre l'humanité, parce qu'il avait des motifs de douter de l'exactitude des rapports émanant du gouvernement du Sri Lanka; il croyait aussi que selon le droit international, un peuple opprimé pouvait légitimement prendre les armes contre ses oppresseurs, même s'il n'approuvait pas personnellement cette méthode.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  Le demandeur affirme qu'il a toujours prôné des moyens non violents de faire valoir ses droits. Il a adhéré à l'Ilankai Tamil Arasuk Kachchi [ITAK], dont le chef croyait en la défense des droits des Tamouls par des moyens politiques et non violents. En 1979, il a été détenu pour avoir dénoncé le gouvernement. Il a finalement été relâché parce que le gouvernement a estimé qu'il n'était pas justifié de porter des accusations contre lui, compte tenu de sa ferme opposition aux moyens de pression violents.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  En 1980, il a adhéré au Front de libération de l'Eelam tamoul [FLET], qui était alors un mouvement au fonctionnement ouvert prônant des changements politiques par des moyens non violents. En 2000, il a adhéré à la TNA. En 2002, des pourparlers de paix ont eu lieu entre les TLET et le gouvernement sri-lankais.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  Le demandeur est venu au Canada au début du mois d'août 2009 et a présenté une demande d'asile au motif qu'il craignait pour sa vie, vu l'augmentation du nombre de meurtres d'activistes tamouls au Sri Lanka. La SI a conclu que le demandeur était en fait un membre des TLET en raison de son appartenance à la TNA.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  Selon la jurisprudence constante de la Cour fédérale et de la Cour d'appel fédérale, la notion de « membre » doit recevoir une interprétation libérale:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 32;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Dans la foulée de l'arrêt  
 Ezokola 
 , le juge O'Reilly a déclaré, aux paragraphes 14 et 15 de  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] ACF no 1171 (QL), que, selon lui, l'« appartenance » doit être interprétée de manière plus restrictive. Toutefois, comme l'ont fait remarquer les défendeurs, le juge O'Reilly ne donne aucun motif à l'appui de cette conclusion et son opinion constitue une opinion incidente. Qui plus est, la juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2014] ACF no 79 (QL) [ 
 Nassereddine 
 ], a estimé que l'opinion du juge O'Reilly était contraire à la jurisprudence. Je souscris à l'opinion de la juge Strickland selon laquelle l'arrêt  
 Ezokola 
  ne modifie en rien le critère de l'interdiction de territoire visé à l'alinéa 34(1) 
 f 
 ) de la LIPR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  L'arrêt  
 Ezokola 
  portait sur l'article 98 de la LIPR, qui exclut de la protection accordée aux réfugiés les personnes visées aux sections E et F de l'article premier de la Convention relative au statut des réfugiés. Ni l'une ni l'autre de ces sections n'a trait à l'appartenance à une organisation terroriste:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 E. Cette Convention ne sera pas applicable à une personne considérée par les autorités compétentes du pays dans lequel cette personne a établi sa résidence comme ayant les droits et les obligations attachés à la possession de la nationalité de ce pays.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 F. Les dispositions de cette Convention ne seront pas applicables aux personnes dont on aura des raisons sérieuses de penser:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 a 
 ) Qu'elles ont commis un crime contre la paix, un crime de guerre ou un crime contre l'humanité, au sens des instruments internationaux élaborés pour prévoir des dispositions relatives à ces crimes;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 b) Qu'elles ont commis un crime grave de droit commun en dehors du pays d'accueil avant d'y être admises comme réfugiées;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 c) Qu'elles se sont rendues coupables d'agissements contraires aux buts et aux principes des Nations Unies.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  Certes, l'article 98 de la LIPR vise les personnes coupables de criminalité internationale, mais l'alinéa 34(1) 
 f 
 ) de la LIPR vise la sécurité nationale et, à cet égard, le législateur a jugé bon de faire de l'appartenance d'une personne à une organisation qui s'est livrée au terrorisme un fait suffisant pour emporter interdiction de territoire à l'égard de cette personne au Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  La Cour d'appel fédérale a jugé qu'il n'est pas nécessaire, pour pouvoir conclure à l'interdiction de territoire en vertu de l'alinéa 34(1) 
 f 
 ) de la LIPR, que les dates de l'adhésion d'un individu à l'organisation correspondent aux dates auxquelles cette organisation a commis des actes de terrorisme ou un renversement par la force:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 1312 (QL). Le demandeur fait valoir qu'à l'époque où il était député, les TLET participaient à des pourparlers de paix avec le gouvernement du Sri Lanka. Cette observation n'est pas pertinente, car les TLET,  
 à une certaine époque, 
  se sont livrés à des activités terroristes. Par conséquent, il importe peu que le demandeur n'ait pas été membre de cette organisation lorsque ces activités ont eu lieu. Quoi qu'il en soit, il ressort de la preuve au dossier que durant les élections en 2004 (alors que le demandeur était membre de la TNA), les TLET continuaient d'user de tactiques comme l'intimidation et le meurtre pour parvenir à leurs fins.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  De plus, il n'importe pas de savoir si le demandeur était, de quelque façon, impliqué dans les activités des TLET puisque l'alinéa 34(1) 
 f 
 ) de la LIPR ne vise aucunement la complicité. S'il est raisonnable de la part de la SI de conclure que la TNA est effectivement la même organisation que les TLET, il suffit, aux fins de l'alinéa 34(1) 
 f 
 ), que le demandeur ait été membre de la TNA. Je vais maintenant examiner la nature de la TNA.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Le demandeur a témoigné qu'à sa connaissance, la TNA collaborait avec les TLET, mais les deux organisations fonctionnaient en parallèle; la TNA n'était pas une représentante des TLET. Il a aussi témoigné qu'au cours de son mandat de député, il n'a jamais reçu de directives des TLET et la TNA n'a jamais participé, de quelque manière que ce soit, aux activités des TLET.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Il a affirmé qu'il croyait personnellement en une lutte non violente, mais que les actions (violentes) des TLET étaient inévitables. Bien qu'il appuie le même objectif ultime, soit la libération des Tamouls, il ne s'est jamais considéré comme un membre des TLET. Jamais il n'a cherché à obtenir des appuis financiers ou autres pour les TLET et il n'a jamais approuvé le recours des TLET à la violence pour faire avancer leur cause.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  La position adoptée par le demandeur est peut-être pacifique, mais il convient de prendre en compte, comme l'a fait la SI, la preuve documentaire versée au dossier, qui indique ce qui suit:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (i) les TLET ont fait campagne pour la TNA en 2004;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (ii) les TLET se sont employés à saboter les élections de 2004 en intimidant les membres des partis adverses de manière à garantir à la TNA des sièges au Parlement;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (iii) des membres de la TNA étaient eux-mêmes impliqués dans la violence et l'intimidation;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (iv) des candidats de la TNA ont été sélectionnés et approuvés par les TLET pour aider ceux-ci à atteindre leurs propres buts, ou étaient des membres actifs des TLET;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (v) certains membres de la TNA considéraient que [traduction] « les TLET sont des nôtres et nous les appuyons » (dossier certifié du tribunal, à la page 490);  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (vi) les membres de la TNA qui n'étaient pas de fervents partisans des TLET ont été mis sur la touche, dédaignés par la direction des TLET et tenus dans l'ignorance de certaines décisions;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (vii) la TNA était subordonnée aux TLET;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (viii) la TNA [traduction] « s'est affichée comme la représentante des TLET ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 À mon sens, ces faits constituent des éléments de preuve qui fondent raisonnablement la conclusion de la SI selon laquelle la TNA était subordonnée ou équivalente aux TLET.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  Le demandeur prétend que la SI a commis les erreurs suivantes:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. elle n'a pas tenu compte du contexte des déclarations de soutien aux TLET faites par la TNA: à l'époque, la TNA prônait l'acceptation des TLET comme étant les seuls représentants légitimes du peuple tamoul dans le contexte des pourparlers de paix avec le gouvernement sri-lankais;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. elle n'a pas cherché à savoir si les membres de la TNA avaient de quelque façon participé aux activités des TLET;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. elle a ignoré le fait que les affirmations selon lesquelles la TNA avait été créée par les TLET émanaient des partis adverses;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. elle n'a pas porté attention au fait que les références aux TLET dans le manifeste électoral de la TNA de 2004 ont été faites dans le but d'encourager les pourparlers de paix entre les TLET et le gouvernement, et que la TNA demandait [traduction] « la cessation immédiate de la guerre menée actuellement dans le Nord-Est »;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 5. elle n'a pas tenu compte des déclarations dans le manifeste électoral de 2004 de la TNA qui énoncent expressément des solutions politiques à la question nationale tamoule.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  À mon sens, le demandeur n'a produit aucune preuve précise qui contredit ou remet sérieusement en question la conclusion de la SI selon laquelle la TNA était intimement liée aux TLET. Le fait que la TNA appuyait les TLET dans le but d'encourager les pourparlers de paix ou que son programme politique était non violent ne diminue pas pour autant la force probante de la preuve selon laquelle les TLET soutenaient la TNA par l'intimidation et le meurtre durant les élections de 2004. Cette force probante n'est pas non plus diminuée du fait que les membres que la TNA se considéraient eux-mêmes comme étant également membres des TLET, que les TLET approuvaient les candidats de la TNA et que certains membres de la TNA (mais non le demandeur) étaient  
 eux-mêmes 
  impliqués dans des actes violents contre les partis adverses.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Bien qu'il soit vrai que la preuve touchant la participation des TLET à la création de la TNA provienne surtout de membres des partis adverses, on peut trouver une preuve indépendante dans le  
 Political Handbook of the World: 2005-2006 
 , par CQ Press (A Division of Congressional Quarterly Inc.), à savoir que la TNA [traduction] « s'est affichée comme la représentante des TLET ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  Les buts légitimes d'une organisation peuvent constituer un facteur à prendre en compte sous le régime des articles 98 ou 35 portant sur les personnes coupables par complicité de criminalité internationale. À cet égard, les observations de la Cour suprême du Canada dans

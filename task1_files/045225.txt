INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC- 2001, c 27 (Act) for judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated 31 August 2011 (Decision), which refused the Applicant's application to be deemed a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicant is a citizen of the Slovak Republic who seeks Canada's protection from persecution based on her Roma ethnicity. As an adoptive child, the Applicant also seeks protection from her biological family (Biological Family) who, she says threatened and beat her to bring her back to them.
[3]
The Applicant came to Canada on 19 October 2009 with her adoptive parents, Gejza Cervenak (Gejza), her adoptive father, and Kvetoslava Cervenakova (Kvetoslava), her adoptive mother. All three (Adoptive Family) claimed protection from persecution related to their Roma ethnicity. After they arrived in Canada, the Applicant and her parents each filed a Personal Information Form (PIF); they all adopted a common narrative, written by Gejza (Original Narrative). In the Original Narrative, Gejza said skinheads attacked their home in the Slovak Republic approximately three times a month. The skinheads would break windows, throw rocks, and shout insults.
[4]
In addition to the Original Narrative, the Applicant also answered a number of questions on the PIF Questionnaire. She said her only family members were her adoptive parents. The Applicant also indicated in the PIF Questionnaire that she was unemployed between October 1999 and October 2009, and she had lived in the Slovak Republic from birth to October 2009.
[5]
The Applicant filed an amended PIF Narrative (Amended Narrative) on 16 November 2010. In this narrative, she said she was working at a factory owned by Samsung (Samsung Factory) in 2007. While she was working at the Samsung Factory, she met a woman who claimed to be her biological aunt. Later, the woman brought several other people to the Applicant's room in the factory; these people said the Applicant would be coming home with them. The Applicant went to her adoptive parents' home but did not tell them what had happened.
[6]
Later that night, the Applicant says a woman claiming to be her biological mother (Biological Mother) telephoned the Adoptive Family's home. The Biological Mother swore at Kvetoslava and said she was coming for the Applicant. Some time later, some people claiming to be the Applicant's Biological Family attacked Gjezsa. They screamed at him, pushed him into a wall and tried to take the Applicant by force. The Applicant successfully resisted and called the police. The police said the families should work things out on their own.
[7]
The Applicant says her biological sister sent her a text message saying the Biological Family wanted her to work as a prostitute. The Applicant was so upset by this she attempted suicide. She took pills, but awoke the next morning in hospital. She regretted her suicide attempt and decided to resist the Biological Family's attempts to recruit her into prostitution. The Applicant tried to find work in the Slovak Republic but could not find a job because she is Roma. She eventually began working in a flea market in the Czech Republic(Flea Market) as a vendor.
[8]
One day, while the Applicant was working in the Flea Market, a group of neo-Nazi skinheads attacked the Flea Market (Flea Market Attack). One of the skinheads tossed the Applicant to the ground and kicked her into unconsciousness. This attack gave the Applicant a thrombosis in her foot.
[9]
The Applicant went to hospital in Bratislava, Slovakia, to be treated for the injuries she suffered in the attack on the Flea Market. She was later transferred to a hospital in Presov, Slovak Republic. In this hospital, the Applicant says the nurses discriminated against her because she is Roma. They would not help her to get food, even though she could not walk. The nurses also made her bandage her own wounds and urinate in a bucket. After experiencing this discrimination, the Applicant felt she could no longer live in the Slovak Republic. She also continued to fear her Biological Family, because they kept threatening to burn down her home and insulting her Adoptive Family. The Adoptive Family decided to come to Canada and arrived on 19 October 2009. They claimed protection on 21 October 2009.
[10]
Kvetoslava and Gjezsa withdrew their claims for protection on 12 July 2011. The RPD notified the Applicant on 9 June 2009 that it would hold a scheduling conference for her claim on 27 June 2011. This first notice informed her that, if she had counsel, she should appear with a letter from counsel confirming representation and giving six available dates for a hearing into the merits of her claim. The RPD gave the Applicant a Notice to Appear for a second hearing on 29 June 2011, which contained the same instructions as the first Notice to Appeal. The second notice instructed the Applicant to appear for a scheduling conference on 18 July 2011 (Scheduling Conference).
[11]
George Kubes (Mr. Kubes) - a lawyer practicing in Toronto - says in a letter faxed to Applicant's current counsel that the Applicant contacted him before the Scheduling Conference to ask him to represent her. Mr. Kubes says he instructed the Applicant to attend the Scheduling Conference and gave her six dates on which he was available to proceed with the hearing. He also says he told the Applicant to contact him if the dates he provided her where unsatisfactory to the RPD so he could arrange a hearing date when he could represent her. According to Mr. Kubes, he received no further communication from the Applicant. After the Gejza and Kvetoslava abandoned their claims, Mr. Kubes faxed the RPD an amended PIF narrative which contained events unique to her claim (Amended Narrative).
[12]
The RPD conducted a hearing into the merits of the Applicant's claim on 30 August 2011 (RPD Hearing). The Applicant was unrepresented at the hearing, though she told the RPD that Mr. Kubes was her lawyer. She also said she had tried to contact Mr. Kubes but he had not responded to her and that he had given her a number of dates, which she presented at the scheduling conference. The RPD said its records showed the Applicant had attended the scheduling conference and the Applicant confirmed that this was so. However, the RPD also said its records showed that she was unrepresented. The RPD screening form, which a Statement of Service indicates the RPD served on the Applicant on 18 August 2011, indicates the Applicant did not have counsel at that time.
[13]
The RPD said that, because the Applicant's hearing was set on a peremptory basis, it had to proceed on that day. It noted that Mr. Kubes had not provided anything to say he represented the Applicant. The RPD also noted he had not indicated he would not be able to attend the hearing. The Applicant said she was told at the Scheduling Conference she could represent herself and she would like to proceed as a self-represented claimant. Accordingly, the RPD conducted the hearing with the Applicant representing herself.
[14]
Mr. Kubes letter says the Roma Advocacy Center in Toronto contacted him on 26 September 2011 and told him the Applicant had attended her refugee hearing without representation and had received a negative Decision. Mr. Kubes then contacted the Applicant and she said the RPD had rejected the six dates he proposed and scheduled the hearing for 30 August 2011. Mr. Kubes's letter says the Applicant told him she assumed he would appear for the RPD Hearing because she believed the RPD would advise him of the new hearing date.
[15]
After conducting the RPD Hearing, the RPD came to its Decision on 31 August 2011 and notified the Applicant on 9 September 2011.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[16]
The RPD found the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act, nor was she a person in need of protection under section 97 of the Act. It based these findings on its conclusions the Applicant had not rebutted the presumption of state protection and was not a credible witness.
Preliminary Issue - Applicant Unrepresented
[17]
Before analysing the merits of her claim, the RPD addressed the Applicant's lack of representation at the RPD Hearing. It noted she said she had attempted to contact Mr. Kubes and he had not returned her calls. The RPD also noted that Mr. Kubes had not communicated with it and the Applicant had said she was ready to proceed without counsel. The RPD said it had explained the issues in the case to the Applicant before it proceeded with the RPD Hearing.
Credibility
[18]
The RPD found the Applicant was not a credible or trustworthy witness because of discrepancies between her PIF Questionnaire, Amended Narrative, and oral testimony at the RPD Hearing. It first noted that the testimony of a refugee claimant is presumed true (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA)) and that contradictions and implausiblities in testimony, including omissions, are a proper basis for finding a claimant is not credible.
[19]
The RPD found the answers the Applicant gave to the questions in her PIF Questionnaire were inconsistent with the Amended Narrative, so it drew a negative inference as to her credibility. In her oral testimony and Amended Narrative, she said she was working at the Samsung Factory when her biological aunt approached her to tell her about her Biological Family. In the PIF Questionnaire, she said she was unemployed between 1999 and 2009 and her only relatives were Kvetoslava and Gjezsa. The Applicant also said in the PIF Questionnaire that she had lived in Tichy Potok, Slovak Republic between October 1999 and October 2009. The RPD noted the Applicant said in the Amended Narrative that her biological sister had sent her a text message and that she lived in Galanta, Slovak Republic while she worked at the Samsung Factory.
[20]
Although it gave the Applicant the opportunity to explain the discrepancies between the Amended Narrative, the PIF Questionnaire and her oral testimony at the RPD Hearing, the RPD rejected the explanations she offered. She testified she and her parents did not know how to fill out the PIFs and relied on their interpreter in this regard. The Applicant also said she wanted nothing more to do with her adoptive parents after they withdrew her claim. The RPD noted the Applicant had declared her PIF was true, complete, and correct and had been interpreted to her; she confirmed this at the start of the RPD hearing. The RPD found the Applicant's explanations unsatisfactory and the inconsistencies in her testimony meant she was not credible. It also found the Applicant fabricated the story about her Biological Family.
[21]
The RPD also found the Applicant's story of being attacked in the Flea Market was not plausible. It reviewed the Applicant's oral testimony, noting that she could not recall the months in 2009 when she worked at the Flea Market in the Czech Republic. The RPD found her testimony on this point was evasive because she could not remember in which months she worked at the Flea Market. Also, the Applicant's story did not accord with common sense because the attack would have affected other vendors who would have called the police.
[22]
The RPD also found the Applicant not credible because her PIF Questionnaire did not show she ever worked in the Czech Republic. It said her answers to its questions about her travel history, employment, and residence in the Czech Republic were evasive. The RPD made a negative credibility finding based on her evasiveness, the inconsistencies between the PIF and Amended Narrative, and the implausibility of the Flea Market Attack. It also found her documentary evidence was not reliable or trustworthy.
Documentary Evidence
[23]
The RPD found the Applicant did not provide documentary evidence to show she had been in hospital or had worked in the Samsung Factory. It rejected the Applicant's explanation for not having medical documents - that her doctor had deleted her records - finding that she could have requested documents from the hospitals where she had been treated. The RPD also rejected her explanation for not having documents - that she left them on the streetcar - noting that she had the rest of her documents in a file folder at the hearing. The RPD found the Applicant would not have left some documents on the streetcar while keeping others. The RPD also found the lack of documents was moot in any event, because the Applicant had not had them translated into English. Without English translations, the RPD would not have been able to consider her documents.
[24]
The RPD referred to the
UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Establishing Refugee Status
which says
After the applicant has made a genuine effort to substantiate his story there may still be a lack of evidence for some of his statements. [...] it is hardly possible for a refugee to "prove" every part of his case and, indeed, if this were a requirement the majority of refugees would not be recognized. It is therefore frequently necessary to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt.
The benefit of the doubt should, however, only be given when all available evidence has been obtained and checked and when the examiner is satisfied as to the applicant's general credibility. The applicant's statements must be coherent and plausible, and must not run counter to generally known facts.
[25]
The RPD found it could not give the Applicant the benefit of the doubt because she had not shown that she made genuine efforts to provide evidence about important aspects of her claim. She had provided vague and evasive testimony and was not a credible or trustworthy witness.
State Protection
[26]
The RPD also found the Applicant had not rebutted the presumption of state protection. The RPD reviewed the law on state protection, noting that
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  establishes a presumption that states are able to protect their citizens and that this presumption can only be rebutted with reliable and probative evidence of the states' inability to protect. Further, the RPD noted that local failures do not show the state is unable to protect and the burden on claimants to show they have exhausted all avenues of protection will be heavier in states which are more democratic.
[27]
The RPD found the Applicant had only contacted police in the Slovak Republic for help once: when her Biological Family tried to take her from her home and pushed Gjezsa into a wall. The RPD noted it found this narrative not credible.
[28]
Based on a report from the Department of State in the United States of America-
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2010
:
Slovak Republic
(DOS Report), the RPD also reviewed documentary evidence before it on state protection. It found Roma in the Slovak Republic generally face discrimination. Other information in the RPD's National Documentation Package for the Slovak Republic showed neo-Nazi groups harass Roma people. The RPD found, however, that a legal framework existed in the Slovak Republic which allowed the Slovakian government to combat these problems. The RPD pointed to the Slovak Republic Government's
Third Report on the Implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in the Slovak Republic
(Minorities Report) and found this established the Applicant had several avenues available to her to seek protection.
[29]
The RPD also found the documentary evidence indicated the police response in the Slovak Republic to racially motivated crimes has improved. It related this finding to the Applicant's testimony that the police did not come to her aid when she called them after her Biological Family attacked her and Gjezsa. The RPD also found the Minorities Report indicated that sentences in the Slovak Republic had generally increased where people were convicted of racially motivated crimes. Further, the Minorities Report showed it is easer now than in the past for people like the Applicant to complain about unfair dealings with the police on the basis of ethnicity.
[30]
The RPD concluded that authorities in the Slovak Republic are taking serious action to reduce harassment and discrimination faced by Roma people. It also found the Applicant had produced no clear and convincing evidence that state protection was inadequate. The RPD also noted its earlier finding that the Applicant was not credible or trustworthy, and found she had not shown state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming or that it was objectively unreasonable for her to seek that protection.
[31]
Given its finding on state protection, the RPD found the Applicant was not a person in need of protection or a Convention refugee.

ISSUES
[33]
The Applicant raises the following issues in this application:
a. Whether the RPD breached her right to procedural fairness by holding its hearing without her counsel;
b. Whether her previous counsel's incompetence breached her right to procedural fairness;
c. Whether the RPD misapplied the test for state protection;
d. Whether the RPD's state protection finding was reasonable;
e. Whether the RPD's credibility finding was unreasonable.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[34]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis.
[35]
It is well established that the right to counsel at an RPD hearing is an issue of procedural fairness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Supreme Court of Canada held at paragraph 100 that "It is for the courts, not the Minister, to provide the legal answer to procedural fairness questions." Further, the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> held that the "procedural fairness element is reviewed as a question of law. No deference is due. The decision-maker has either complied with the content of the duty of fairness appropriate for the particular circumstances, or has breached this duty." The standard of review on the first two issues in this case is correctness.
[36]
The third issue challenges the RPD's application of a legal test to the facts before it. This is a question of mixed fact and law to which the applicable standard of review is reasonableness (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 51).
[37]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Federal Court of Appeal held at paragraph 36 that the standard of review on a state protection finding is reasonableness. This approach was followed by Justice Leonard Mandamin in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Further, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer held at paragraph 11 that the standard of review on a state protection finding is reasonableness. The standard of review on the fourth issue is reasonableness.
[38]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) the Federal Court of Appeal held that the standard of review on a credibility finding is reasonableness. Further, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Max Teitelbaum held that findings of credibility are central to the RPD's finding of fact and are therefore to be evaluated on a standard of review of reasonableness. Finally, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Michael Kelen held at paragraph 17 that the standard of review on a credibility determination is reasonableness. The standard of review on the fifth issue is reasonableness.
[39]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47, and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
ARGUMENTS
The Applicant
Breach of Procedural Fairness
[40]
The Applicant says her right to procedural fairness was breached when the RPD did not inquire with Mr. Kubes to determine if he was actually representing her. She also says Mr. Kubes breached her right to procedural fairness by failing to attend the RPD hearing. The Applicant points to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , which she says establishes counsel's incompetence can lead to a breach of procedural fairness where that incompetence results in a complete denial of the opportunity for a hearing (see paragraph 11).
Unreasonable Credibility Finding
[41]
The Applicant also says the RPD's credibility finding based on the inconsistencies between her Amended Narrative and the PIF Questionnaire was unreasonable. She says her Amended Narrative went beyond the Original Narrative and added details of the persecution she had personally suffered. The Applicant relies on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> where Justice Edmond Blanchard held
In my view the Board's credibility finding is patently unreasonable. Subsection 6(4) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR/2002-228 (the Rules), affords the parties the opportunity to amend their PIF. In the circumstances, it was not open to the Board to find as it did based on the Applicant's "overall testimony". A plausible explanation for the amendment was offered by the Applicant and the opportunity to amend a PIF is provided for in the Rules. The Board gave no valid reason to impugn the Applicant's credibility on these facts. The credibility finding is patently unreasonable.
State Protection Finding Unreasonable
The RPD Misapplied the Test for State Protection
[42]
The RPD misapplied the test for state protection which the Supreme Court of Canada set out in
Ward
, above. The RPD relied on institutional structures in the Slovak Republic for its finding that she had not rebutted the presumption of state protection. The Applicant points to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Justice Luc Martineau held as follows at paragraph 56:
It is also wrong in law for the Board to adopt a "systemic"approach which may have the net effect of denying individual refugee claims on the sole ground that the documentary evidence generally shows the Hungarian government is making some efforts to protect Romas from persecution or discrimination by police authorities, housing authorities and other groups that have historically persecuted them. The existence of anti-discrimination provisions in itself is not proof that state protection is available in practice: "Ability of a state to protect must be seen to comprehend not only the existence of an effective legislative and procedural framework but the capacity and the will to effectively implement that framework" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 121). Hungary is now considered a democratic nation which normally would be considered as being able to provide state protection to all its citizens (
Ward
,
supra
). Unfortunately, there are still doubts concerning the effectiveness of the means taken by the government to reach this goal. Therefore, a "reality check" with the claimants' own experiences appears necessary in all cases.
[43]
The RPD should have considered the Applicant's actual experience in seeking state protection. Instead, it simply looked at the institutional framework present in the Slovak Republic. The Applicant also points to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Justice Michel Shore found in "the case before us, the state did not demonstrate that it had the capacity to implement a framework for the applicants' protection. It must be reiterated that, with respect to 'state protection', each case turns on its own facts" (see paragraph 26). [Emphasis in original].
The RPD Ignored Evidence
[44]
The RPD's state protection finding was also unreasonable because it ignored evidence which showed state protection in the Slovak Republic was ineffective. The Applicant says the RPD ignored the DOS Report and a report from Amnesty International - the
Annual Report 2011
:
Slovakia
.
Discrimination vs
.
Persecution
[45]
The RPD's state protection finding was also unreasonable because it found the acts the Applicant suffered were discrimination and not persecution. The RPD ought to have found the Applicant's experiences were persecution because acts of criminal violence always amount to persecution. The state protection finding was also unreasonable because it found the Applicant should have gone to an agency other than the police for help. She notes that Justice Tremblay-Lamer held in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> held as follows:
In my opinion, the Board erred in imposing on the applicants the burden of seeking redress from agencies other than the police.
The purpose of the police is to protect the citizens. If they refuse or are unwilling to act, this Court has indicated that there is no obligation on an individual to seek counselling, legal advice, or assistance from human rights agencies.
[46]
As a victim of persecution, not discrimination, the Applicant should not have been required to go beyond the police in seeking protection.
Plausibility Finding Unreasonable
[47]
The Applicant also says the RPD's credibility finding was unreasonable because it was based on an unreasonable finding that her story was implausible. She says this implausibility finding was based on an irrelevant factor: the availability of state protection in the Czech Republic. The RPD found her story of the Flea Market Attack was implausible because it thought other vendors would have called the police if the attack had actually occurred. The Applicant says the RPD should not have considered the police response to the attack in the Flea Market because this event occurred in the Czech Republic. The Applicant claims protection against the Slovak Republic, so the police response to the Flea Market Attack is irrelevant.
[48]
The RPD also said its implausibility finding was based on common sense, but the Applicant says common sense does not lead to the conclusion reached by the RPD. She also says the RPD unreasonably based this implausibility finding on extrinsic evidence, rather than inconsistencies internal to her story. This is a reversible error which calls for the Court's intervention.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Microscopic Evaluation of the Evidence
[49]
The RPD's credibility finding was also unreasonable because it was based on a selective and microscopic analysis of the evidence. The Applicant relies on the Federal Court of Appeal's judgment on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where it held the RPD should "not be over-vigilant in its microscopic examination of the evidence." She also points to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA), where the Federal Court of Appeal held that "selective treatment in respect of various segments of the appellant's testimony is not calculated to enhance one's confidence in the Board's assessment of the appellant's credibility."
The Respondent
No Breach of Procedural Fairness
[50]
The Respondent says the Applicant's right to procedural fairness was not violated by her previous counsel's incompetence. She has not shown how the outcome of her claim would have been different had she been represented before the RPD, so even if she was denied the right to counsel, the Decision should stand. The Respondent points to
R v GDB
2000 SCC 22 (QL) where the Supreme Court of Canada held that for "an appeal to succeed, it must be established, first, that counsel's acts or omissions constituted incompetence and second, that a miscarriage of justice resulted."
[51]
The Applicant has also not met her obligation to notify her previous counsel of her allegations against him. Since she has not met this obligation, established in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Applicant cannot succeed in judicial review by claiming previous counsel was incompetent.
[52]
The Respondent further points out that the Applicant was not represented because of her own error. Mr. Kubes gave the Applicant dates at which he could attend hearings, but she did not contact him when the RPD did not find any of these dates acceptable. The Applicant also agreed to proceed without counsel when it became apparent Mr. Kubes would not be attending the hearing. The Applicant should be held to this choice.
[53]
The Applicant has not shown how the outcome would have been different had she been represented. Hers is not a case where counsel's incompetence is clearly established and undermined the outcome of the hearing. Representation would not have changed the fact there were clear discrepancies and omissions in her evidence or the RPD's determinative finding on state protection.
Credibility Findings Reasonable
[54]
The RPD's credibility finding was reasonably based on inconsistencies, contradictions, and omissions in the Applicant's evidence. Following
Canada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Respondent says these are bases from which the RPD may reasonably draw a negative credibility finding. The Applicant's oral testimony was not consistent with either her Original or Amended Narratives. Although the Original Narrative contained the story of the Biological Family's threats against the Adoptive Family, the Amended Narrative added the detail about the biological sister warning the Applicant that the Biological Family wanted to push her into prostitution. The Amended Narrative was also inconsistent with the PIF Questionnaire. Although the Applicant's claim was focussed on the threat from the Biological Family, key details were missing from the Original Narrative.
[55]
The Respondent also notes the Applicant did not provide documentary evidence to support her claim. A failure to corroborate elements of a claim where a claimant's story generally lacks credibility may result in a finding that those elements have not been established.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Reasonable State Protection Finding
[56]
Finally, the Respondent says the RPD's finding that the Applicant had not rebutted the presumption of state protection was reasonable. The RPD conducted a full and detailed review of the conditions in the Slovak Republic and found protection was available to the Applicant. The RPD provided clear reasons and considered improvements in legislation and social practice in the Slovak Republic. The RPD acknowledged problems which exist in the Slovak Republic, but concluded state protection nevertheless existed. The RPD grasped the issues which were before it and drew a conclusion which is supported by the record. In the face of case law which shows the Applicant bears the onus to rebut the presumption of state protection (see
Ward
, above) and that a police officer's non-response is not enough to rebut the presumption, the Court should not interfere.
ANALYSIS
[57]
In my view, the Decision gives rise to two important areas of concern that require it to be returned for reconsideration.
[58]
First of all, it is not entirely clear why Mr. Kubes did not appear at the RPD meeting or the extent to which the Applicant herself may have been responsible for some of the confusion. However, I think there is clear evidence that Mr. Kubes was counsel of the record for the Applicant's family, and later the Applicant, and that the RPD should have been aware of this. When faulting the Applicant, the RPD failed to take into account Mr. Kubes' responsibilities as counsel and that the Applicant was, in effect, left in the lurch at the hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at paragraph 7. In the end, the Applicant did not get a fair hearing.
[59]
The Applicant clearly stated at the hearing that Mr. Kubes was her lawyer and there was evidence on the record of the RPD dealing with Mr. Kubes. So it is hard to see why the RPD concluded there was no solicitor of record and that "Mr. Kubes hasn't seen fit to either indicate that he's your counsel as he's supposed to do."
[60]
Having left out of account the indications on the file that Mr. Kubes was counsel for the Applicant, the RPD also told the Applicant that the hearing was peremptory and "must go forward today." This left her with no choice but to try and represent herself. The record shows she was nervous and did not do a very good job of it.
[61]
The Respondent says this makes no difference because, even with counsel, the outcome could not have been different. Quite apart from the case law which says that procedural unfairness is, per se, a reviewable error (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 54), on the facts of the present case it is clear to me that the absence of counsel made a significant difference to the outcome of this matter.
[62]
One of the troubling aspects of the Decision is that the RPD drew a negative inference from the Applicant's failure to produce corroborative documentary evidence:
The Panel cannot extend the benefit of the doubt to the claimant with regard to the credibility of her narratives because she did not establish that she made continuing efforts to provide any evidence of any type with regard to the existence of the claimant's biological sister, her employment at Samsung, her employment in the Czech Republic or any of her three hospitalizations in both the Czech and Slovak Republics. As well, the Panel determines that the claimant gave evasive vague and evasive testimony and that she was not a credible or trustworthy witness.
[63]
However, the Applicant attempted to produce an adoption certificate which listed her biological siblings
.
However, the RPD did not consider accepting this document as evidence because it was not translated. So she had made an effort to provide documentary evidence. The RPD takes the position that it is moot or irrelevant because "none of this documentation has been translated in English, therefore, the Panel would not be able to consider this material."
[64]
Although the section 25(1) of the Rules establishes that documents provided to the RPD must be translated, the Court has also held that, when presented with an unrepresented litigant, the strict and technical rules should be relaxed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Without counsel, the Applicant would really have no way of knowing that the document had to be translated for the RPD to consider it. I have to wonder why the RPD would not give the Applicant an opportunity, post-hearing, to provide it with a translated version of the adoption certificate. With that said, even documentation that has not been translated shows that the Applicant made an effort to corroborate her claim.
[65]
This is of particular importance given the RPD's credibility finding that the Applicant had not indicated that she had a biological sister and that "the claimant's narrative with regard to the incidents surrounding her biological parents and relatives is an invented narrative."
[66]
The Applicant was also faulted for not providing documentation to corroborate her "three alleged hospitalizations." The Applicant said she had left documents on a Toronto street car on her way to the hearing. Once again, the RPD rejects this explanation, and says it is moot because of the lack of translation. The Applicant is never given an opportunity to replace these documents that she claimed to have mislaid.
[67]
If counsel had been present, the translation and lost document issue would have been dealt with much more fairly. It is not reasonable to expect an unrepresented claimant to know that she can ask for an adjournment if necessary, especially after the RPD told her the hearing had to proceed that day. The Applicant could easily have provided a translation of the adoption certificate post-hearing, and there is nothing to suggest she could not, with counsel's assistance, have provided replacement hospitalization documents in a timely way.
[68]
The Applicant's testimony was problematic but I think that, overall, the lack of procedural fairness and the absence of counsel led to material mistakes that render the Decision unsafe and unreasonable. I also agree with the Applicant that the RPD's assessment of the documentary package as part of the state protection analysis gives rise to a reviewable error.
[69]
The RPD knew it had to find more than that the Slovak Republic has made"serious efforts" to protect Roma people. Its conclusions in this regard are as follows:
The evidence clearly shows that the Roma still suffer from higher rates of unemployment and lower educational achievement. The Roma are still excluded from regular life in terms of housing and healthcare. The documentary evidence indicates that the state is making serious efforts and, although progress is slow, there are signs of progress. It is unreasonable to expect that these measures should have prevented or eliminated all racism or acts of violence related to race; however, this is an indication of the serious efforts the state has made to combat racial discrimination in every aspect of society. The progress is not as rapid and there have been set-backs and obstacles, but the commitment of the state to continue the battle is not in question. The quality of existence for the Roma is not what it should be, but their existence is not threatened by the state. While skinheads and extremists seek to threaten the existence of the Roma, the state takes serious actions against that as well.
The Panel has previously determined that the claimant's oral and documentary evidence has not been reliable and that the claimant has not been a credible and trustworthy witness. However, the documentary evidence is clear that a problem of harassment and discrimination towards Roma and other minorities in the Slovak Republic exist. The documentary evidence is also clear that authorities are taking serious action and that there are results. The evidence that state protection would be inadequate is neither clear nor convincing.
[70]
The RPD refers here to "serious actions" against skinhead violence and that, as regards harassment and discrimination, the "documentary evidence is also clear that authorities are taking serious action, and that there are results."
[71]
The body of the analysis seems to suggest that what the RPD means by "serious actions" and "results" are a few convictions for racial attacks, prosecution for a few police officers, and some increase in sentencing rates. Even in the RPD's own words, however, "progress is slow," and the Roma are still at serious risk. If I review the preponderance of the evidence, I just do not see what there is to support the RPD's vague conclusions that "there are signs of some success," or "the situation had improved," and why this vagueness supports a finding of adequate state protection.
[72]
The RPD seems to contradict itself:
The documentary evidence of the Board indicates that Roma and other minorities suffer discrimination and violence in the Slovak Republic and that police mistreat Romani suspects and detainees. The evidence also supports the claimant's contention that organized neo-Nazi groups and sympathizers harass and attack minorities including the Roma. Further, police might not intervene or investigate properly when there are Roma involved, although this varies by jurisdiction. The Roma generally face discrimination in health care, education, housing and employment in the Slovak Republic as well. In addition, many Roma face severe difficulties and discrimination accessing adequate housing and employment and that they experience segregation in schools and health care facilities. Notwithstanding the latter materials, the documentary evidence indicates that the Slovak Republic has taken and is taking steps to combat these deficiencies and there are signs of real progress. For example, there is a deeply entrenched legal framework as a basis for which the Slovak Republic can combat these problems. The legal framework includes the Constitution, legislation and international obligations as well.
[73]
The analysis makes an attempt to assess what Justice Mosley has called "operational adequacy" (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), but very little is referred to that suggests the Slovak Republic is willing or able to protect Roma people from the widespread violence and mistreatment that the RPD acknowledges is still rampant.
[74]
I do not see the RPD weighing the evidence in this Decision and concluding that the situation is mixed but, overall, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that protection is adequate. Rather, the RPD searches desperately for any sign of operational adequacy in a generally bleak situation and calls this "real progress" and "some success" and "serious action." I cannot see how any of what is cited can possibly be called "adequate," against the general picture of desperation and acknowledged inadequacy. This aspect of the state protection analysis is unreasonable because there is an insufficient basis for the "adequacy" conclusion and the obvious inadequacies, although mentioned, do not enter the RPD's analysis.
[75]
Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[76]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application is allowed. The Decision is quashed and returned for reconsideration by a differently constituted RPD.
2. There is no question for certification.

[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), à l'encontre de la décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié, rendue le 31 août 2011 (la décision), dans laquelle la SPR a refusé de reconnaître à la demanderesse la qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention et celle de personne à protéger visées aux articles 96 et 97 de la Loi.
LE CONTEXTE
[2]
La demanderesse est une citoyenne de la République slovaque qui demande l'asile au Canada afin d'échapper à la persécution fondée sur son appartenance à l'ethnie rom. En tant qu'enfant adopté, la demanderesse demande également à être protégée contre sa famille biologique (la famille biologique), qui l'aurait menacée et battue pour la ramener dans son giron.
[3]
La demanderesse est venue au Canada le 19 octobre 2009 avec ses parents adoptifs, Gejza Cervenak (Gejza), son père adoptif, et Kvetoslava Cervenakova (Kvetoslava), sa mère adoptive. Tous trois (la famille adoptive) ont demandé l'asile pour échapper à la persécution fondée sur leur appartenance à l'ethnie rom. Après leur arrivée au Canada, la demanderesse et ses parents adoptifs ont chacun produit un formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP); ils ont tous adopté un exposé circonstancié commun, rédigé par Gejza (l'exposé circonstancié original). Dans l'exposé circonstancié original, Gejza affirmait que des skinheads attaquaient leur demeure en République slovaque environ trois fois par mois. Les skinheads cassaient des vitres, lançaient des pierres et criaient des insultes.
[4]
En plus de l'exposé circonstancié original, la demanderesse a également répondu à plusieurs questions sur le questionnaire de son FRP. Elle a dit que les seuls membres de sa famille étaient ses parents adoptifs. La demanderesse a également indiqué dans le questionnaire de son FRP qu'elle avait été sans emploi entre octobre 1999 et octobre 2009 et qu'elle avait vécu en République slovaque depuis sa naissance jusqu'en octobre 2009.
[5]
La demanderesse a produit un exposé circonstancié modifié de son FRP (exposé circonstancié modifié) le 16 novembre 2010. Dans cet exposé circonstancié, elle affirmait qu'elle travaillait dans une usine appartenant à Samsung (l'usine Samsung) en 2007. Alors qu'elle travaillait à l'usine Samsung, elle avait rencontré une femme qui prétendait être sa tante biologique. Plus tard, la femme avait présenté plusieurs autres personnes à la demanderesse dans le local où celle-ci travaillait à l'usine; ces personnes avaient dit que la demanderesse rentrerait à la maison avec eux. La demanderesse est rentrée chez ses parents adoptifs, mais elle ne leur a pas dit ce qui s'était passé.
[6]
Plus tard ce soir-là, la demanderesse affirme qu'une femme qui prétendait être sa mère biologique (la mère biologique) a téléphoné chez la famille adoptive. La mère biologique a injurié Kvetoslava et a dit qu'elle venait chercher la demanderesse. Quelque temps après, des gens qui prétendaient être des membres de la famille biologique de la demanderesse ont attaqué Gjezsa. Ils lui ont crié après et l'ont poussé contre un mur, et ils ont tenté de s'emparer de la demanderesse par la force. La demanderesse a réussi à leur résister, et elle a appelé la police. La police a dit que les familles devraient régler leurs problèmes entre elles.
[7]
La demanderesse affirme que sa sœur biologique lui a envoyé un message texte disant que la famille biologique voulait qu'elle travaille comme prostituée. Cela a tellement bouleversé la demanderesse qu'elle a tenté de se suicider. Elle a avalé des comprimés, mais elle s'est réveillée le lendemain à l'hôpital. Elle a regretté sa tentative de suicide et a décidé de résister aux tentatives de la famille biologique de la recruter comme prostituée. La demanderesse a tenté de trouver du travail dans la République slovaque, mais elle n'a pas pu trouver d'emploi, parce qu'elle est rom. Elle a finalement commencé à travailler dans un marché aux puces en République tchèque (le marché aux puces) comme vendeuse.
[8]
Un jour, alors que la demanderesse travaillait au marché aux puces, un groupe de skinheads néonazis a attaqué le marché aux puces (l'attaque du marché aux puces). Un des skinheads a projeté la demanderesse au sol et l'a rouée de coups de pied jusqu'à ce qu'elle en perde connaissance. Cette attaque a donné à la demanderesse une thrombose au pied.
[9]
La demanderesse s'est rendue dans un hôpital à Bratislava, en Slovaquie, pour être traitée pour les blessures qu'elle avait subies lors de l'attaque du marché aux puces. Elle a par la suite été transférée à un hôpital à Presov, en République slovaque. Dans cet hôpital, la demanderesse affirme que les infirmières ont fait de la discrimination contre elle, parce qu'elle est rom. Elles ne l'aidaient pas à obtenir de la nourriture, même si la demanderesse ne pouvait pas marcher. Les infirmières lui ont également fait panser elle-même ses plaies et l'ont obligée à uriner dans un seau. Après avoir vécu cette discrimination, la demanderesse a conclu qu'elle ne pouvait plus vivre en République slovaque. Elle continuait également à craindre sa famille biologique, parce que celle-ci ne cessait pas de tenter d'incendier sa demeure et d'insulter sa famille adoptive. La famille adoptive a décidé de venir au Canada, où elle est arrivée le 19 octobre 2009. Les membres de la famille ont demandé l'asile le 21 octobre 2009.
[10]
Kvetoslava et Gjezsa ont retiré leur demande d'asile le 12 juillet 2011. Le 9 juin 2009, la SPR a avisé la demanderesse qu'elle tiendrait une conférence de mise au rôle de sa demande d'asile le 27 juin 2011. Ce premier avis informait la demanderesse que, si elle avait un conseil, elle devrait comparaître avec une lettre du conseil confirmant qu'il la représentait et indiquant six dates de disponibilité en vue d'une audition sur le fond de la demande d'asile de la demanderesse. La SPR a envoyé à la demanderesse un avis de comparution à une deuxième audience le 29 juin 2011, qui contenait les mêmes instructions que le premier avis de comparution. Le deuxième avis donnait instruction à la demanderesse de comparaître pour une conférence de mise au rôle le 18 juillet 2011 (la conférence de mise au rôle).
[11]
George Kubes (Me Kubes) - un avocat exerçant sa profession à Toronto - affirme, dans une lettre télécopiée à l'avocat actuel de la demanderesse, que celle-ci a communiqué avec lui avant la conférence de mise au rôle pour lui demander de la représenter. Me Kubes affirme qu'il a avisé la demanderesse d'assister à la conférence de mise au rôle et lui a donné six dates auxquelles il serait disponible pour la représenter lors de l'audition de sa demande d'asile. Il affirme également qu'il a dit à la demanderesse de communiquer avec lui si les dates qu'il lui avait données ne convenaient pas à la SPR, afin qu'il puisse trouver une date d'audience à laquelle il pourrait la représenter. Selon Me Kubes, celui-ci n'a reçu aucune autre communication de la demanderesse. Après que Gejza et Kvetoslava se furent désistés de leur demande d'asile, Me Kubes a télécopié à la SPR un exposé circonstancié modifié du FRP de la demanderesse qui relatait des événements spécifiques à sa demande (l'exposé circonstancié modifié).
[12]
La SPR a examiné la demande de la demanderesse sur le fond, lors d'une audience tenue le 30 août 2011 (l'audience de la SPR). La demanderesse n'était pas représentée lors de cette audience, bien qu'elle ait dit à la SPR que Me Kubes était son avocat. Elle a également affirmé qu'elle avait tenté de communiquer avec Me Kubes, mais que celui-ci ne lui avait pas répondu, et qu'il lui avait donné différentes dates qu'elle avait présentées à la conférence de mise au rôle. La SPR a affirmé que son dossier indiquait que la demanderesse avait assisté à la conférence de mise au rôle, et la demanderesse a confirmé que cela était exact. Cependant, la SPR a également affirmé que ses dossiers indiquaient que la demanderesse n'était pas représentée. Le formulaire d'examen initial de la SPR, dont une déclaration de signification indique que la SPR l'a signifié à la demanderesse le 18 août 2011, indique que la demanderesse n'avait pas de conseil à cette époque.
[13]
La SPR a affirmé qu'étant donné que la date fixée pour l'audition de la demande d'asile de la demanderesse était péremptoire, elle devait aller de l'avant ce jour-là. Elle a noté que Me Kubes n'avait rien fourni pour dire qu'il représentait la demanderesse. La SPR a également mentionné que Me Kubes n'avait pas indiqué qu'il ne serait pas en mesure d'assister à l'audience. La demanderesse a affirmé qu'on lui avait dit, à la conférence de mise au rôle, qu'elle pouvait se représenter elle-même, et elle avait répondu dit qu'elle souhaitait plaider en tant que demanderesse se représentant elle-même. En conséquence, la SPR a tenu l'audience en présence de la demanderesse se représentant elle-même.
[14]
La lettre de Me Kubes indique que le Roma Advocacy Center à Toronto a communiqué avec lui le 26 septembre 2011 et lui a dit que la demanderesse avait assisté à l'audition de sa demande d'asile sans représentation et qu'elle avait reçu une décision défavorable. Me Kubes a ensuite communiqué avec la demanderesse, et celle-ci lui a dit que la SPR avait rejeté les six dates qu'il avait proposées et avait fixé l'audience au 30 août 2011. La lettre de Me Kubes indique que la demanderesse lui a dit qu'elle avait présumé qu'il comparaîtrait à l'audience de la SPR, parce qu'elle croyait que la SPR l'aviserait de la nouvelle date d'audience.
[15]
Après avoir tenu son audience, la SPR a prononcé sa décision le 31 août 2011 et a avisé la demanderesse le 9 septembre 2011.
LA DEMANDE FAISANT L'OBJET DU PRÉSENT CONTRÔLE
[16]
La SPR a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait ni qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention aux termes de l'article 96 de la Loi, ni qualité de personne à protéger aux termes de l'article 97 de la Loi. Elle a fondé sa décision sur ses conclusions selon lesquelles la demanderesse n'avait pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État et qu'elle n'était pas un témoin crédible.
La question préliminaire - la demanderesse non représentée
[17]
Avant d'analyser sa demande d'asile sur le fond, la SPR a traité du fait que la demanderesse n'était pas représentée à l'audience. Elle a noté que la demanderesse avait dit qu'elle avait tenté de communiquer avec Me Kubes et que celui-ci ne l'avait pas rappelée. La SPR a également noté que Me Kubes n'avait pas communiqué avec la SPR et que la demanderesse avait dit qu'elle était prête à aller de l'avant sans conseil. La SPR a dit qu'elle avait expliqué à la demanderesse les questions que soulevait l'affaire avant de tenir l'audience.
La crédibilité
[18]
La SPR a conclu que la demanderesse n'était pas un témoin crédible ni digne de foi, à cause de divergences entre le questionnaire de son FRP, son exposé circonstancié modifié et son témoignage de vive voix à l'audience de la SPR. La SPR a tout d'abord fait remarquer que le témoignage d'un demandeur d'asile est présumé véridique (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)) et que des contradictions ainsi que des invraisemblances dans le témoignage du demandeur d'asile, y compris des omissions, constituent un motif valable de conclure qu'un demandeur d'asile n'est pas crédible.
[19]
La SPR e conclu que les réponses que la demanderesse avait données aux questions du questionnaire de son FRP contredisaient son exposé circonstancié modifié, et elle en a tiré une inférence négative quant à sa crédibilité. Dans son témoignage de vive voix et dans son exposé circonstancié modifié, la demanderesse a dit qu'elle travaillait à l'usine Samsung, où sa tante biologique était venue la voir pour lui parler de sa famille biologique. Dans le questionnaire de son FRP, elle avait dit qu'elle avait été sans emploi entre 1999 et 2009 et que ses seuls parents étaient Kvetoslava et Gjezsa. La demanderesse avait également dit dans le questionnaire de son FRP qu'elle avait vécu à Tichy Potok, en République slovaque, entre octobre 1999 et octobre 2009. La SPR a noté que la demanderesse avait déclaré, dans l'exposé circonstancié modifié, que sa sœur biologique lui avait envoyé un message texte et qu'elle vivait à Galanta, en République slovaque, à l'époque où elle travaillait à l'usine Samsung.
[20]
La SPR a donné à la demanderesse la possibilité d'expliquer les contradictions entre l'exposé circonstancié modifié, le questionnaire de son FRP et son témoignage de vive voix à l'audience de la SPR, mais elle a rejeté les explications que la demanderesse a données. Elle a affirmé qu'elle et ses parents ne savaient pas comment remplir les FRP et qu'ils s'étaient fiés à leur interprète à cet égard. La demanderesse a également affirmé qu'elle ne voulait plus rien savoir de ses parents adoptifs après qu'ils eurent retiré leur demande d'asile. La SPR a fait remarquer que la demanderesse avait déclaré que son FRP était véridique, complet et exact et qu'il lui avait été lu par un interprète; elle avait confirmé cela au début de l'audience de la SPR. La SPR a trouvé non convaincantes les explications de la demanderesse, et elle a conclu des contradictions dans le témoignage de la demanderesse que celle-ci n'était pas crédible. Elle a également conclu que la demanderesse avait inventé l'histoire au sujet de sa famille biologique.
[21]
La SPR a également conclu que les prétentions de la demanderesse selon lesquelles elle avait été attaquée au marché aux puces n'étaient pas vraisemblables. Elle a examiné le témoignage de vive voix de la demanderesse en notant que celle-ci ne parvenait pas à se souvenir durant quels mois, en 2009, elle avait travaillé au marché aux puces, en République tchèque. La SPR a trouvé le témoignage de la demanderesse évasif sur ce point, parce que celle-ci n'était pas parvenue à se souvenir durant quels mois elle avait travaillé au marché aux puces. En outre, le récit de la demanderesse allait contre le bon sens, parce que l'attaque aurait touché d'autres vendeurs qui auraient appelé la police.
[22]
La SPR a également conclu que la demanderesse n'était pas crédible, parce que le questionnaire de son FRP n'indiquait pas qu'elle avait déjà travaillé en République tchèque. La SPR a affirmé que les réponses de la demanderesse au sujet de ses séjours, de son emploi et de sa résidence en République tchèque étaient évasives. La SPR a tiré une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité fondée sur le caractère évasif du témoignage de la demanderesse, les contradictions entre le FRP et l'exposé circonstancié modifié ainsi que l'invraisemblance de l'attaque du marché aux puces. La SPR a également conclu que les éléments de preuve documentaire présentés par la demanderesse n'étaient pas fiables ni dignes de foi.
La preuve documentaire
[23]
La SPR a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas produit d'éléments de preuve documentaire pour démontrer qu'elle avait été hospitalisée ni qu'elle avait travaillé à l'usine Samsung. Elle n'a pas admis la raison invoquée par la demanderesse pour expliquer pourquoi elle n'avait pas de documents médicaux - son médecin avait détruit ses dossiers - et la SPR a conclu que la demanderesse aurait pu demander des documents des hôpitaux où elle avait été traitée. La SPR n'a pas admis non plus la raison que la demanderesse a invoquée pour expliquer pourquoi elle n'avait pas certains documents - elle les avait laissés dans un tramway - et la SPR a fait remarquer qu'elle avait le reste de ses documents dans une chemise à l'audience. La SPR a conclu que la demanderesse n'aurait pas laissé certains documents dans un tramway tout en en conservant d'autres. La SPR a également conclu que l'absence de documents était de toute façon une question théorique, puisque la demanderesse ne les avait pas fait traduire en anglais. Faute de disposer de traductions anglaises, la SPR n'aurait pas été en mesure d'examiner les documents de la demanderesse.
[24]
La SPR a cité le
Guide des procédures et critères à appliquer pour déterminer le statut de réfugié
du Haut-commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés, qui énonce:
Il est possible qu'après que le demandeur se sera sincèrement efforcé d'établir l'exactitude des faits qu'il rapporte, certaines de ses affirmations ne soient cependant pas prouvées à l'évidence. [...] un réfugié peut difficilement« prouver » tous les éléments de son cas et, si c'était là une condition absolue, la plupart des réfugiés ne seraient pas reconnus comme tels. Il est donc souvent nécessaire de donner au demandeur le bénéfice du doute.
Néanmoins, le bénéfice du doute ne doit être donné que lorsque tous les éléments de preuve disponibles ont été réunis et vérifiés et lorsque l'examinateur est convaincu de manière générale de la crédibilité du demandeur. Les déclarations du demandeur doivent être cohérentes et plausibles, et ne pas être en contradiction avec des faits notoires.
[25]
La SPR a conclu qu'elle ne pouvait pas donner le bénéfice du doute à la demanderesse, parce que celle-ci n'avait pas démontré qu'elle s'était sincèrement efforcée de fournir des éléments de preuve au sujet d'aspects importants de sa demande d'asile. Elle avait livré un témoignage vague et évasif, et elle n'était pas un témoin crédible ni digne de foi.
La protection de l'État
[26]
La SPR a également conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État. La SPR a examiné le droit sur la protection de l'État, en notant que l'arrêt
Canada (Procureur général) c Ward
, [1993] 2 RCS 689, établit une présomption selon laquelle les États sont capables de protéger leurs citoyens et que cette présomption peut seulement être réfutée au moyen d'éléments de preuve fiables et probants de l'incapacité de l'État d'assurer une protection. En outre, la SPR a fait remarquer que les omissions locales ne démontraient pas que l'État était incapable d'assurer une protection, et que le fardeau incombant aux demandeurs d'asile de démontrer qu'ils ont épuisé tous les recours disponibles pour assurer leur protection sera plus lourd dans les États qui sont plus démocratiques.
[27]
La SPR a conclu que la demanderesse avait seulement demandé l'aide des services de police une fois en République slovaque: lorsque sa famille biologique avait tenté de l'enlever de chez elle et avait poussé Gjezsa contre un mur. La SPR a mentionné qu'elle trouvait ce récit non crédible.
[28]
En s'appuyant sur un rapport du Département d'État des États-Unis d'Amérique intitulé
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2010
:
Slovak Republic
(le rapport du Département d'État des États-Unis), la SPR a également examiné les éléments de preuve documentaire dont elle disposait au sujet de la protection de l'État. Elle a conclu que les Roms en République slovaque étaient généralement victimes de discrimination. D'autres renseignements contenus dans le cartable national de documentation de la SPR concernant la République tchèque indiquaient que des groupes néo-nazis harcelaient les Roms. La SPR a toutefois conclu qu'il existait un cadre juridique en République slovaque qui permettait au gouvernement slovaque de lutter contre ces problèmes. La SPR a cité le
Third Report on the Implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in the Slovak Republic
du gouvernement de la République slovaque (le rapport sur les minorités), et elle a conclu que ce rapport établissait que la demanderesse disposait de plusieurs recours pour obtenir une protection.
[29]
La SPR a également conclu que les éléments de preuve documentaire indiquaient que les interventions des services de police dans les cas de crimes à caractère raciste en République slovaque s'étaient améliorées. La SPR a relié cette conclusion au témoignage de la demanderesse selon lequel la police n'était pas venue à son secours lorsqu'elle l'avait appelée, après que sa famille biologique les eut attaqués, elle et Gjezsa. La SPR a également conclu que le rapport sur les minorités indiquait que les peines infligées aux auteurs de crimes à caractère raciste en République slovaque étaient généralement plus sévères qu'auparavant. En outre, le rapport sur les minorités indiquait qu'il était plus facile que par le passé pour des gens comme la demanderesse de se plaindre lorsque les services de police les traitaient de manière inéquitable à cause de leur ethnie.
[30]
La SPR a conclu que les autorités en République slovaque prenaient des mesures vigoureuses pour réduire le harcèlement et la discrimination à l'endroit des Roms. Elle a également conclu que la demanderesse n'avait produit aucune preuve claire et convaincante du caractère inadéquat de la protection de l'État. La SPR a également mentionné sa conclusion antérieure selon laquelle la demanderesse n'était pas crédible ni digne de foi, et elle a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas démontré que la protection de l'État ne pouvait raisonnablement être assurée ou qu'il était objectivement déraisonnable pour elle de chercher à obtenir une protection.
[31]
Compte tenu de sa conclusion au sujet de la protection de l'État, la SPR a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas qualité de personne à protéger ni qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention.

LA NORME DE CONTRÔLE
[34]
La Cour suprême du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a décidé que l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle n'a pas besoin d'être menée dans chaque instance. Plutôt, lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable à une question précise présentée à la cour est bien établie par la jurisprudence, la cour de révision peut adopter cette norme de contrôle. Ce n'est que lorsque cette démarche se révèle infructueuse que la cour de révision doit entreprendre l'examen des quatre facteurs que comprend l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle.
[35]
Il est bien établi que le droit à un conseil lors d'une audience de la SPR est une question d'équité procédurale (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), la Cour suprême du Canada a statué au paragraphe 100 qu'« [i] l appartient aux tribunaux judiciaires et non au ministre de donner une réponse juridique aux questions d'équité procédurale ». La Cour suprême du Canada a également statué dans le même arrêt que, lorsqu'un décideur agit à l'encontre de l'expectative légitime d'une partie, la cour de révision peut accorder une réparation procédurale (voir le paragraphe 131). En outre, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> la Cour d'appel fédérale a statué que « [l] a question de l'équité procédurale est une question de droit. Aucune déférence n'est nécessaire. Soit le décideur a respecté l'obligation d'équité dans les circonstances propres à l'affaire, soit il a manqué à cette obligation. » La norme de contrôle applicable aux deux premières questions dans la présente affaire est la décision correcte.
[36]
La troisième question concerne l'application d'un critère juridique par la SPR aux faits dont elle disposait. Il s'agit d'une question mixte de fait et de droit susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 51).
[37]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour d'appel fédérale a statué, au paragraphe 36, que la norme de contrôle applicable à une conclusion quant à la protection de l'État était la décision raisonnable. Le juge Leonard Mandamin a retenu cette solution dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . En outre, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la juge Danièle Tremblay-Lamer a statué, au paragraphe 11, que la norme de contrôle applicable à une conclusion quant à la protection de l'État était la décision raisonnable. La norme de contrôle applicable à la quatrième question est la décision raisonnable.
[38]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), la Cour d'appel fédérale a statué que la norme de contrôle applicable à une conclusion quant à la crédibilité était la décision raisonnable. En outre, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge Max Teitelbaum a statué que les conclusions quant à la crédibilité étaient au cœur de la conclusion de fait de la SPR et devaient donc être contrôlées selon la norme de la décision raisonnable. Enfin, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Michael Kelen a statué, au paragraphe 17, que la norme de contrôle applicable à une conclusion quant à la crédibilité était la décision raisonnable. La norme de contrôle applicable à la cinquième question est la décision raisonnable.
[39]
Lors du contrôle d'une décision selon la norme de la raisonnabilité, l'analyse tient « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ». Voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Autrement dit, la Cour devrait intervenir seulement si la décision est déraisonnable en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas aux« issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».
LES ARGUMENTS
La demanderesse
Le manquement à l'équité procédurale
[40]
La demanderesse affirme que son droit à l'équité procédurale a été violé lorsque la SPR ne s'est pas enquise auprès de Me Kubes pour déterminer s'il représentait effectivement la demanderesse. Elle affirme également que Me Kubes a violé son droit à l'équité procédurale en omettant d'assister à l'audience de la SPR. La demanderesse invoque la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , qui établit, selon elle, que l'incompétence d'un avocat peut mener à un manquement à l'équité procédurale lorsque cette incompétence prive complètement l'intéressé de son droit d'être entendu (voir le paragraphe 11).
La conclusion déraisonnable quant à la crédibilité
[41]
La demanderesse affirme également que la conclusion de la SPR quant à la crédibilité fondée sur des contradictions entre l'exposé circonstancié modifié de la demanderesse et le questionnaire de son FRP était déraisonnable. La demanderesse affirme que son exposé circonstancié modifié allait au-delà de l'exposé circonstancié original et ajoutait des précisions relatives à la persécution qu'elle avait subie personnellement. La demanderesse invoque la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  où le juge Edmond Blanchard a statué, au paragraphe 21:
À mon avis, la conclusion de la Commission touchant la crédibilité est manifestement déraisonnable. Le paragraphe 6(4) des
Règles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-228 (les Règles), accorde aux parties la possibilité de corriger leur FRP. Dans les circonstances, il n'est pas loisible à la Commission de statuer comme elle l'a fait en s'appuyant sur le « témoignage d'ensemble » du demandeur. Le demandeur a donné une explication plausible de sa correction et la possibilité de corriger un FRP est prévue par les Règles. La Commission n'a donné aucune raison valable pour attaquer la crédibilité du demandeur sur ces faits. La conclusion sur la crédibilité est manifestement déraisonnable.
La conclusion déraisonnable quant à la protection de l'État
La SPR a mal appliqué le critère de la protection de l'État
[42]
La SPR a mal appliqué le critère de la protection de l'État que la Cour suprême du Canada avait énoncé dans l'arrêt
Ward
, précité. La SPR s'est appuyée sur des structures institutionnelles en République slovaque pour conclure que la demanderesse n'avait pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État. La demanderesse invoque la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  où le juge Luc Martineau a statué, au paragraphe 56:
La Commission commet aussi une erreur de droit en adoptant une approche « systémique » qui peut avoir comme résultat net le rejet de demandes particulières de statut de réfugié pour le seul motif que la preuve documentaire indique généralement que le gouvernement hongrois fait certains efforts pour protéger les Roms de la persécution ou de la discrimination exercée par les autorités policières, les autorités chargées du logement et les autres groupes qui les ont persécutés jusqu'ici. L'existence de mesures contre la discrimination ne constitue pas en soi une preuve que la protection de l'État est disponible en fait: « Non seulement le pouvoir protecteur de l'État doit-il comporter un encadrement légal et procédural efficace mais également la capacité et la volonté d'en mettre les dispositions en œuvre » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1reinst.), au paragraphe 15). On reconnaît maintenant que la Hongrie est une nation démocratique qui devrait normalement pouvoir assurer la protection de l'État à tous ses citoyens (l'arrêt
Ward
, précité). Malheureusement, il existe encore des doutes quant à l'efficacité des moyens utilisés par le gouvernement pour atteindre cet objectif. Par conséquent, il y a lieu dans tous les cas de confronter la situation théorique avec le vécu de chaque revendicateur.
[43]
La SPR aurait dû tenir compte de l'expérience concrète que la demanderesse avait vécue lorsqu'elle avait tenté d'obtenir la protection de l'État. Au lieu de cela, la SPR a tout simplement examiné le cadre institutionnel existant en République slovaque. La demanderesse invoque également la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  où le juge Michael Shore a conclu que dans « le présent cas, le pouvoir protecteur de l'État ne démontre pas avoir la capacité de mettre des dispositions concernant la protection des demandeurs en œuvre. Il faut réitérer que, en ce qui a trait à la notion de "
protection de l'État", chaque cas, est un cas d'espèce
. » (voir le paragraphe 26) [souligné dans l'original].
La SPR a fait abstraction d'éléments de preuve
[44]
La conclusion de la SPR quant à la protection de l'État était également déraisonnable, parce que la SPR a fait abstraction d'éléments de preuve qui démontraient que la protection de l'État en République slovaque était inefficace. La demanderesse affirme que la SPR a fait fi du rapport du Département d'État des États-Unis et d'un rapport d'Amnesty International intitulé
Annual Report 2011
:
Slovakia
.
La discrimination par opposition à la persécution
[45]
La conclusion de la SPR quant à la protection de l'État était également déraisonnable, parce que la SPR a conclu que les actes que la demanderesse avait subis constituaient de la discrimination, et non de la persécution. La SPR aurait dû conclure que la demanderesse avait été victime de persécution, parce que les actes de violence criminelle équivalent toujours à de la persécution. La conclusion quant à la protection de l'État était également déraisonnable, parce que la SPR a conclu que la demanderesse aurait dû s'adresser à une agence autre que les services de police pour obtenir de l'aide. La demanderesse fait remarquer qu'aux paragraphes 23 et 24 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la juge Tremblay-Lamer a statué:
Selon moi, la Commission a commis une erreur en imposant aux revendicateurs le fardeau de chercher réparation auprès d'agences autres que les services de police.
Le rôle des policiers est de protéger les citoyens. S'ils refusent de le faire ou s'ils ne sont pas disposés à agir, notre Cour a déjà conclu que les personnes en cause n'étaient pas tenues de rechercher de l'orientation, des avis juridiques ou de l'aide auprès des agences des droits de la personne.
[46]
En tant que victime de persécution, et non de discrimination, la demanderesse n'aurait pas dû être tenue de chercher une protection au-delà des services de police.
La conclusion déraisonnable quant à la vraisemblance
[47]
La demanderesse affirme également que la conclusion de la SPR quant à la crédibilité était déraisonnable, parce qu'elle était fondée sur une conclusion déraisonnable selon laquelle le récit de la demanderesse était invraisemblable. La demanderesse affirme que cette conclusion d'invraisemblance était fondée sur un facteur non pertinent: la disponibilité d'une protection de l'État en République tchèque. La SPR a conclu que le récit de la demanderesse au sujet de l'attaque du marché aux puces était invraisemblable, parce qu'elle pensait que d'autres vendeurs auraient appelé la police si l'attaque avait effectivement eu lieu. La demanderesse affirme que la SPR n'aurait pas dû tenir compte de la réaction de la police à l'attaque au marché aux puces, parce que cet événement est survenu en République tchèque. La demanderesse demande à être protégée de la République slovaque, de sorte que la réaction des services de police à l'attaque du marché aux puces est non pertinente.
[48]
La SPR a également affirmé que sa conclusion d'invraisemblance était fondée sur le sens commun, mais la demanderesse affirme que le sens commun ne mène pas à la conclusion que la SPR a tirée. La demanderesse affirme également que la SPR a fondé déraisonnablement cette conclusion d'invraisemblance sur des éléments de preuve extrinsèque plutôt que sur des contradictions internes dans son récit. Il s'agit-là d'une erreur susceptible de contrôle qui commande l'intervention de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
L'examen microscopique de la preuve
[49]
La conclusion de la SPR quant à la crédibilité était également déraisonnable, parce qu'elle était fondée sur une analyse sélective et microscopique de la preuve. La demanderesse invoque l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  de la Cour d'appel fédérale, où celle-ci a statué que la SPR « ne devrait pas manifester une vigilance excessive en examinant à la loupe [les éléments de preuve] ». La demanderesse invoque également l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), où la Cour d'appel fédérale a statué qu'un « traitement sélectif de divers éléments de témoignage de l'appelant ne contribue pas à donner confiance en l'évaluation que la Commission a faite de la crédibilité de l'appelant ».
Le défendeur
L'absence de manquement à l'équité procédurale
[50]
Le défendeur affirme que l'incompétence de l'avocat précédent de la demanderesse n'a pas entraîné de manquement à l'équité procédurale. La demanderesse n'a pas démontré en quoi le sort de sa demande d'asile aurait été différent si elle avait été représentée devant la SPR, de sorte que, même si la demanderesse a été privée du droit d'être représentée par un conseil, la décision devrait être maintenue. Le défendeur invoque l'arrêt
R c GDB
, 2000 CSC 22 (QL), où la Cour suprême du Canada a statué que, « [p] our qu'un appel soit accueilli, il faut démontrer, dans un premier temps, que les actes ou les omissions de l'avocat relevaient de l'incompétence, et, dans un deuxième temps, qu'une erreur judiciaire en a résulté ».
[51]
La demanderesse ne s'est pas non plus acquittée de son obligation d'aviser son avocat précédent des allégations qu'elle formulait contre lui. Puisqu'elle ne s'est pas acquittée de cette obligation, établie dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la demanderesse ne peut pas obtenir gain de cause dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire en soutenant que son avocat précédent a été incompétent.
[52]
Le défendeur souligne en outre que la demanderesse n'était pas représentée à cause de sa propre erreur. Me Kubes avait donné à la demanderesse des dates auxquelles il pouvait assister à des audiences, mais la demanderesse n'a pas communiqué avec lui lorsque la SPR n'a jugé aucune de ces dates acceptable. La demanderesse a également accepté d'aller de l'avant sans conseil lorsqu'il est devenu évident que Me Kubes n'assisterait pas à l'audience. La demanderesse devrait être tenue d'assumer les conséquences de ce choix.
[53]
La demanderesse n'a pas démontré en quoi l'issue aurait été différente si elle avait été représentée. Il ne s'agit pas d'un cas où l'incompétence de l'avocat est clairement établie et où elle a compromis le résultat de l'audience. Une représentation n'aurait changé ni le fait qu'il y avait des contradictions et des omissions claires dans la preuve de la demanderesse, ni la conclusion déterminante de la SPR concernant la protection de l'État.
Les conclusions raisonnables quant à la crédibilité
[54]
La conclusion de la SPR quant à la crédibilité était raisonnablement fondée sur des incohérences, des contradictions et des omissions dans les éléments de preuve présentés par la demanderesse. Suivant la décision
Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le défendeur affirme qu'il s'agit-là d'éléments dont la SPR peut raisonnablement tirer une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité. Le témoignage de vive voix de la demanderesse ne s'accordait ni avec son exposé circonstancié original ni avec son exposé circonstancié modifié. L'exposé circonstancié original comportait certes le récit des menaces proférées par la famille biologique à l'endroit de la famille adoptive, mais l'exposé circonstancié modifié ajoutait le détail relatif à la sœur biologique ayant averti la demanderesse que la famille biologique voulait la contraindre à se prostituer. Il y avait également des contradictions entre l'exposé circonstancié modifié et le questionnaire du FRP. Bien que la demande d'asile de la demanderesse fût fondée principalement sur la menace que présentait sa famille biologique, il manquait certains détails essentiels dans l'exposé circonstancié original.
[55]
Le défendeur fait également remarquer que la demanderesse n'a pas produit d'éléments de preuve documentaire au soutien de sa demande d'asile. Le défaut de corroborer certains éléments d'une demande d'asile, lorsque le récit du demandeur manque de manière générale de crédibilité, peut mener à la conclusion selon laquelle ces éléments n'ont pas été établis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
La conclusion raisonnable quant à la protection de l'État
[56]
Enfin, le défendeur affirme que la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle la demanderesse n'avait pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État était raisonnable. La SPR a procédé à un examen complet et détaillé des conditions en République slovaque et a conclu que la demanderesse pouvait y obtenir une protection. La SPR a exposé des motifs clairs et elle a examiné des améliorations apportées aux lois et observées dans les pratiques sociales en République slovaque. La SPR a reconnu certains problèmes qui existent en République slovaque, mais elle a conclu que la protection de l'État y existait tout de même. La SPR a compris les enjeux de l'affaire dont elle était saisie, et elle a tiré une conclusion qui est étayée par le dossier. Compte tenu de la jurisprudence qui indique que la demanderesse a le fardeau de réfuter la présomption de protection de l'État (voir l'arrêt
Ward
, précité) et du fait que la non-intervention d'un policier n'est pas suffisante pour réfuter la présomption, la Cour ne devrait pas intervenir.
ANALYSE
[57]
À mon avis, la décision comporte deux aspects problématiques importants qui m'obligent à la renvoyer pour nouvel examen.
[58]
Tout d'abord, il n'est pas tout à fait clair pourquoi Me Kubes n'a pas comparu à l'audience de la SPR ou dans quelle mesure la demanderesse elle-même est peut-être responsable d'une partie de la confusion. Cependant, je pense qu'il y a une preuve claire que Me Kubes a été le conseil inscrit au dossier pour la famille de la demanderesse, puis pour la demanderesse, et la SPR aurait dû être au courant de cela. Lorsqu'elle a tenu la demanderesse pour fautive, la SPR a omis de tenir compte des responsabilités de Me Kubes en tant qu'avocat et du fait que la demanderesse avait, en fait, été laissée en plan lors de l'audience. Voir l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), au paragraphe 7. En fin de compte, la demanderesse n'a pas eu une audience équitable.
[59]
La demanderesse a clairement affirmé à l'audience que Me Kubes était son avocat, et le dossier de la SPR comportait des éléments de preuve relatifs à Me Kubes. Il est donc difficile de voir pourquoi la SPR a conclu qu'il n'y avait aucun avocat inscrit au dossier et que [TRADUCTION] « Me Kubes n'a pas non plus cru bon d'indiquer qu'il est votre avocat, comme il est censé le faire ».
[60]
N'ayant pas tenu compte des indications au dossier selon lesquelles Me Kubes était le conseil de la demanderesse, la SPR a également dit à la demanderesse que l'audience était péremptoire et qu'elle [TRADUCTION] « doit être tenue aujourd'hui ». Cela n'a laissé d'autre choix à la demanderesse que de tenter de se représenter elle-même. Le dossier montre qu'elle était nerveuse et qu'elle ne s'est pas très bien débrouillée.
[61]
Le défendeur affirme que cela ne change rien à l'affaire, puisque, même avec un conseil, l'issue n'aurait pas pu être différente. Indépendamment de la jurisprudence qui dit qu'une iniquité procédurale est, en soi, une erreur susceptible de contrôle (voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 54), compte tenu des faits de la présente espèce, il me paraît clair que l'absence de conseil a fait une différence importante quant à l'issue de cette affaire.
[62]
Un des aspects troublants de la décision est que la SPR a tiré une inférence négative du défaut de la demanderesse de produire des éléments de preuve documentaire corroborative:
Le tribunal ne peut accorder le bénéfice du doute à la demandeure d'asile en ce qui concerne la crédibilité de ses exposés circonstanciés parce qu'elle n'a pas démontré qu'elle s'est sincèrement efforcée de fournir une preuve quelconque corroborant l'existence d'une sœur biologique, de son emploi chez Samsung, de son emploi en République tchèque ou de l'une ou l'autre de ses hospitalisations en République tchèque et en République slovaque. Le tribunal estime également que la demandeure d'asile a témoigné de manière vague et évasive et qu'elle n'était pas un témoin crédible et digne de foi.
[63]
Pourtant, la demanderesse a tenté de produire un certificat d'adoption qui comportait une liste de ses frères et sœurs biologiques. Toutefois, la SPR n'a pas envisagé d'admettre ce document en preuve, parce qu'il n'était pas traduit. Ainsi, la demanderesse s'était bel et bien efforcée de fournir une preuve documentaire. La SPR considère que la question est purement théorique ou non pertinente « car aucun de ces documents n'a été traduit en anglais, et le tribunal n'aurait donc pas pu en tenir compte ».
[64]
Bien que le paragraphe 25(1) des Règles dispose que les documents fournis à la SPR doivent être traduits, la Cour a aussi statué que, dans le cas de parties non représentées, les règles strictes et techniques devraient être assouplies.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Sans conseil, la demanderesse n'avait vraiment aucun moyen de savoir que le document devait être traduit pour que la SPR puisse en tenir compte. Je me perds en conjectures quant à savoir pourquoi la SPR n'a pas donné à la demanderesse la possibilité de lui fournir, après l'audience, une version traduite du certificat d'adoption. Cela étant dit, même la documentation qui n'a pas été traduite montre que la demanderesse s'est efforcée de corroborer sa prétention.
[65]
Cela revêt une importance particulière, étant donné la conclusion de la SPR concernant la crédibilité selon laquelle la demanderesse n'avait pas indiqué qu'elle avait une sœur biologique et « le récit de la demandeure d'asile concernant ses parents biologiques et les autres membres de sa famille biologique n'est que pure invention ».
[66]
Il a également été reproché à la demanderesse de ne pas avoir fourni de documentation pour corroborer ses « trois présumés séjours à l'hôpital ». La demanderesse a dit qu'elle avait laissé des documents à bord d'un tramway de Toronto en venant à l'audience. Encore une fois, la SPR rejette cette explication, et elle dit que la question est purement théorique en raison de l'absence de traduction. La possibilité n'est jamais offerte à la demanderesse de remplacer ces documents qu'elle a dit avoir égarés.
[67]
Si un conseil avait été présent, la question de la traduction et du document perdu aurait été traitée de manière beaucoup plus équitable. Il n'est pas raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'une demandeure d'asile non représentée sache qu'elle peut demander un ajournement si nécessaire, surtout après que la SPR lui a dit que l'audience devait être tenue ce jour-là. La demanderesse aurait facilement pu fournir une traduction du certificat d'adoption après l'audience, et il n'y a rien qui incite à croire qu'elle n'aurait pas pu, avec l'aide d'un conseil, fournir en temps opportun des documents de remplacement concernant ses hospitalisations.
[68]
Le témoignage de la demanderesse était problématique, mais je pense que, de manière générale, le manque d'équité procédurale et l'absence de conseil ont mené à des erreurs importantes qui rendent la décision de la SPR imprudente et déraisonnable. Je conviens également avec la demanderesse que l'appréciation de la trousse documentaire par la SPR dans le cadre de l'analyse relative à la protection de l'État comporte une erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[69]
La SPR savait qu'elle ne pouvait pas se contenter d'affirmer que la République slovaque avait fait « de sérieux efforts » pour protéger les Roms. Voici ses conclusions à cet égard:
Les éléments de preuve démontrent clairement que les Roms sont toujours touchés par des taux de chômage élevés et un faible niveau de scolarisation. Les Roms sont toujours exclus de la vie normale en ce qui a trait au logement et aux soins de santé. Les éléments de preuve documentaire indiquent que l'État fait de sérieux efforts et que, même si l'évolution est lente, des progrès ont été observés. Il serait déraisonnable de s'attendre à ce que ces mesures empêchent ou éliminent complètement le racisme ou tous les actes de violence liés au racisme. Toutefois, elles montrent que de véritables efforts sont déployés par l'État pour combattre la discrimination raciale dans tous les secteurs de la société. La progression n'est pas tellement rapide et elle se heurte à des revers et à des obstacles, mais l'engagement de l'État à poursuivre la lutte est incontestable. La qualité de vie des Roms n'est pas ce qu'elle devrait être, mais leur existence n'est pas menacée par l'État. Les skinheads et les extrémistes cherchent à menacer l'existence des Roms, mais l'État, en contrepartie, prend des mesures importantes pour lutter contre cette situation.
Le tribunal a déjà conclu que le témoignage oral et la preuve documentaire de la demandeure d'asile n'étaient pas fiables et que cette dernière n'était pas un témoin crédible ou digne de foi. Toutefois, la preuve documentaire montre clairement qu'il existe un problème de harcèlement et de discrimination à l'endroit des Roms et d'autres minorités en République slovaque. Il ressort clairement aussi que les autorités prennent des mesures rigoureuses et qu'il y a des résultats. La preuve selon laquelle la protection de l'État serait inadéquate n'est ni claire ni convaincante.
[70]
La SPR parle ici de « mesures importantes »contre la violence des skinheads et affirme qu'en ce qui a trait au harcèlement et à la discrimination, « [i] l ressort clairement aussi que les autorités prennent des mesures rigoureuses et qu'il y a des résultats ».
[71]
D'après le corps de l'analyse, il semblerait que la SPR entende par les termes « mesures importantes » et« résultats » quelques condamnations pour des attaques racistes, la poursuite de quelques policiers et une certaine augmentation des taux des peines. Pour reprendre les mots de la SPR elle-même, toutefois, « l'évolution est lente », et les Roms demeurent exposés à de graves dangers. Si j'examine la prépondérance de la preuve, je ne vois tout simplement pas ce qui peut étayer les conclusions vagues de la SPR selon lesquelles « des progrès ont été observés » ou « la situation s'était améliorée »,ni pourquoi cette imprécision étaye une conclusion de protection adéquate de l'État.
[72]
La SPR semble se contredire:
Les éléments de preuve documentaire de la Commission révèlent que les Roms et d'autres minorités sont victimes de discrimination et de violence en République slovaque et que la police maltraite les suspects et les détenus d'origine rom. Les éléments de preuve corroborent aussi l'allégation de la demandeure d'asile selon laquelle les groupes néonazis organisés et leurs sympathisants harcèlent les minorités et commettent des agressions à l'endroit de ceux-ci, y compris les Roms. En outre, il arrive que la police n'intervienne pas ou n'enquête pas adéquatement dans les cas où des Roms sont visés, mais cela varie en fonction du corps policier en cause. En République slovaque également, les Roms subissent généralement de la discrimination relativement aux soins de santé, à l'éducation, au logement et à l'emploi. En outre, de nombreux Roms se heurtent à de graves difficultés et à de la discrimination en matière d'accès à un logement et à un emploi, et sont victimes de ségrégation dans les écoles et dans les établissements de santé. Malgré ces documents, les éléments de preuve documentaire indiquent que la République slovaque a pris et prend toujours des mesures pour lutter contre ces problèmes, et elle manifeste de réels progrès. Par exemple, elle possède un cadre législatif solidement établi sur lequel elle peut s'appuyer pour combattre ces problèmes. Ce cadre législatif regroupe la constitution, les lois et les obligations internationales.
[73]
L'analyse tente d'apprécier ce que le juge Mosley a appelé le « caractère satisfaisant des efforts concrets » (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), mais bien peu de choses sont mentionnées qui portent à croire que la République slovaque a la volonté ou la capacité de protéger les Roms contre la violence et les mauvais traitements largement répandus dont la SPR reconnaît qu'ils demeurent endémiques.
[74]
Je ne vois pas la SPR soupeser les éléments de preuve dans cette décision et conclure que la situation est variable, mais que, dans l'ensemble, il y a suffisamment d'éléments de preuve qui portent à croire que la protection est adéquate. Au lieu de cela, la SPR cherche désespérément le moindre signe de caractère satisfaisant des efforts concrets dans le contexte d'une situation très sombre, et elle appelle cela « de réels progrès », « des progrès » et « des mesures rigoureuses ».Je ne parviens pas du tout à voir comment quoi que ce soit de ce qui est évoqué pourrait avoir un « caractère satisfaisant », en avant-plan d'un tableau général de désespoir et d'inadéquation reconnue. Cet aspect de l'analyse relative à la protection de l'État est déraisonnable, parce que la conclusion quant au « caractère satisfaisant » de la protection de l'État n'a pas suffisamment d'assises et que les inadéquations évidentes, bien qu'elles soient mentionnées, ne sont pas prises en compte dans l'analyse de la SPR.
[75]
Les avocats conviennent qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier, et la Cour est d'accord.
JUGEMENT
[76]
LA COUR STATUE que
1. La demande est accueillie. La décision est annulée et renvoyée pour nouvel examen par un tribunal différemment constitué de la SPR.
2. Il n'y a aucune question à certifier.

 Locke, J. 
  [Translation]: This is an application for judicial review of an adjudicator's decision dismissing an unjust dismissal complaint by Samir Abani.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Mr. Abani was informed of the dismissal by his employer, the respondent Rogers Communications Inc. (Rogers) in a letter dated April 11, 2011. The employer's decision was based on a very high rate of absenteeism over a two-year period, and the employer did not believe that the situation would improve. The letter dated April 11, 2011, also referred to several warnings about his absences that had been given to Mr. Abani during this period.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Mr. Abani registered a complaint of unjust dismissal with Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC). The adjudicative tribunal that was appointed, Adjudicator Jean Vézina, found that it was not unreasonable for Rogers to dismiss Mr. Abani. The adjudicator referred to Mr. Abani's multiple absences and accepted the conclusion of Shepell-fgi (an independent company that manages Rogers' short-term disability leave program) that the absences were not attributable to a medical problem. The adjudicator also referred to a two-month period when Mr. Abani was outside Canada even after that leave had been refused. According to the adjudicator, this trip permanently broke the bond of trust required between employer and employee.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  Mr. Abani alleges that the adjudicator breached the rules of natural justice by not considering the relevant evidence that he submitted. For the reasons that follow, I am dismissing the application for judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 I.  
 FACTS  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  On April 30, 2007, the applicant was hired by Rogers in Toronto. In August 2008, the applicant was transferred to Montréal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  On December 1, 2009, a representative of Rogers met with Mr. Abani and gave him a warning letter regarding his unjustified absences during August and September 2009. The letter indicated that Mr. Abani was absent six times during this period.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  On July 2, 2010, Mr. Abani received a letter from Shepell-fgi requesting medical information to support Mr. Abani's claim to be incapable of working. The letter indicated that Shepell-fgi found the applicant to be eligible for the period from June 27, 2010 to July 3, 2010 (inclusive) and had sent Rogers a notice in that regard.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  On August, 16, 2010, Mr. Abani requested three months leave without pay. This request was refused. Despite the refusal, on August 27, 2010, Mr. Abani bought a plane ticket to go to Morocco for two months.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  On September 6, 2010, Mr. Abani met with a psychologist who suggested that he take four weeks off to rest. On September 9, 2010, Mr. Abani left for Morocco without informing Rogers even though his leave request had been refused.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  On September 29, 2010, the processing of Mr. Abani's file was suspended because Shepell-fgi decided that it did not have enough reasons to accept Mr. Abani's application for disability leave. The letter requested that Mr. Abani ask his doctor to complete a medical report. This report was completed on October 8, 2010, during Mr. Abani's absence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  On October 18, 2010, Shepell-fgi sent Mr. Abani a letter indicating that his application for disability leave had been denied. Mr. Abani was informed that Shepell-fgi had reviewed his application for short-term disability leave and found that the medical evidence was insufficient to justify his absence from work as of September 28, 2010. The letter explained the process for appealing this decision and set out the new medical information that would have to be sent to Shepell-fgi. This information included the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Extent and severity of symptoms based on the diagnosis;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Objective medical data to support the diagnosis including test results;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Prognosis in relation to the diagnosis;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Functional limitations that would prevent him from performing the essential duties of his job or his temporary assignment and that renders him completely disabled;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Treatment plan, accompanied by information about the results to date;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Complete clinical notes written by his doctor, therapist or other specialists consulted after August 18, 2010.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  On November 7, 2010, Mr. Abani returned from Morocco. On November 8, 2010, Mr. Abani received a letter from his team leader, Maxime Nivose, informing him that, according to Rogers, he had not provided documents justifying his absences. This letter also indicated what additional information should be provided.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  On November 29, 2010, Mr. Abani sent another medical report from his doctor to justify his absences. On December 3, 2010, Shepell-fgi replied and stated that the new medical information was still not sufficient to justify his absences from work.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  On December 7, 2010, Rogers sent a second warning letter concerning Mr. Abani's unjustified absences during July and August. The letter indicated that Mr. Abani was absent for 6.55 days during this period.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  A third warning letter was sent to Mr. Abani on February 16, 2011, regarding his absences during the period from April to November 2010. The letter indicated that Mr. Abani was absent 86 days during this period, including 61 days from September to November. The letter indicates the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [Translation]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 If we do not see radical improvement over the next three months, we will have to implement more serious measures that could go as far as termination of employment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 It is crucial that your attendance improve in the next three months and we ask you to do what is required to improve. If you do not, you risk termination of your employment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Despite these warning letters, Mr. Abani continued his work absences without medical justification. On March 24, 2011, Mr. Abani provided another medical report, from a different doctor this time. On March 29, 2011, Shepell-fgi found again that the evidence did not provide medical reasons for his absence from work.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  On April 11, 2011, Rogers terminated Mr. Abani's employment because he was unable to provide regular attendance at his job.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  On June 23, 2011, Mr. Abani filed a complaint with HRSDC-Labour Program under section 240 of the  
 Canada Labour Code 
 , RSC 1985, c L-2, Part III (unjust dismissal). On April 30, 2012, Jean Vézina was appointed by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service as adjudicator to dispose of the complaint.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  At all material times in this matter, Mr. Abani was represented by Ms. Labib Issa. He is now represented by Émilie Le-Huy.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  On May 28, 2012, the adjudicator convened the parties to a hearing on September 6, 2012. Rogers presented its evidence through the testimony of two Rogers representatives (Maxime Nivose, client services team leader, and Michèle Farley, senior manager for client services), as well as Sandra Martin, supervisor at Shepell-fgi. Counsel for Mr. Abani cross-examined Mr. Nivose and Ms. Farley. She chose not to cross-examine Ms. Martin.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  As the presentation of the evidence was not completed on September 6, 2012, the adjudicator convened the parties for hearings on May 10 and 27, 2013. On May 10, 2013, counsel for Mr. Abani called only one witness for her evidence, Mr. Abani.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  On May 27, 2013, the respondent finished cross examining Mr. Abani. Then, counsel for Mr. Abani announced that her case was closed. Rogers then had Michèle Farley testify in rebuttal. Counsel for Mr. Abani cross-examined Ms. Farley.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  On June 17, 2013, the adjudicator convened the parties to present their respective submissions on August 28, 2013. The adjudicator granted all the time necessary for counsel for Mr. Abani to make her oral submissions and allowed her to make written submissions with supporting authorities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  The adjudicator rendered his decision on September 30, 2013.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II.  
 STANDARD OF REVIEW  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  As mentioned above, Mr. Abani alleges that the adjudicator breached the principles of natural justice by not considering the relevant evidence before him. The applicable standard of review in that situation is correctness. But if there were no breach of the principles of natural justice, and this is actually a challenge to the adjudicator's assessment of the evidence, the decision is to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 199.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III.  
 APPLICANT'S ARGUMENTS  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  Mr. Abani contends that the adjudicator failed to consider the documents that he had submitted in support of his complaint. He referred to numerous reports sent to Rogers at their request, including the report from his doctor dated November 29, 2010, as well as his psychologist's report dated September 6, 2010.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Mr. Abani submits that he made all the necessary efforts to prove the validity of his work absences and that Rogers could have requested an additional assessment, but the adjudicator did not take these facts into consideration.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  Mr. Abani maintains that the Rogers policy manual contains a commitment to find another position for an employee who is temporarily off work, and submits that the adjudicator ignored that clause.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  Last, Mr. Abani referred to Rogers' duty of reasonable accommodation as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 ANALYSIS AND DECISION  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  I am satisfied that there has been no breach of the principles of natural justice in this case. No evidence was excluded and Mr. Abani received all the relevant documents had all the usual occasions to cross-examine the witnesses for Rogers and present his submissions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  With respect to Mr. Abani's medical reports, the adjudicator was clearly aware of them. He refers to them at paragraphs 15 and 17 of his decision. The adjudicator clearly agreed with Shepell-fgi such that the reports submitted by Mr. Abani were not sufficient to claim that his work absences were caused by one or more medical problems.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  I would note that at paragraph 35 of the adjudicator's decision, he indicates that [Translation] "no evidence was submitted" regarding the issue of work-related stress problems for Mr. Abani. What I understand from this paragraph is that no sufficient evidence was submitted. The medical reports were part of the evidence but they were not sufficient. Mr. Abani's evidence was based on a single witness, Mr. Abani himself. There were no witnesses with medical expertise, but it was based on the medical reports that had been submitted to Rogers.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  In my opinion, the essence of Mr. Abani's challenge to the adjudicator's decision is that the adjudicator did not give enough weight to his evidence and his arguments. Thus, the adjudicator's decision is to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness. The adjudicator did not ignore the documents submitted as evidence. He simply did not agree with Mr. Abani with respect to their importance.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  In my opinion, the adjudicator's decision, with respect to Mr. Abani's absences from work and insufficient evidence of a medical problem, is reasonable. The adjudicator reviewed Rogers' evidence in that regard, including the role of Shepell-fgi. He noted Mr. Abani's absenteeism rate from 2009 to 2011, the insufficient medical reports submitted by Mr. Abani despite the multiple extensions of time given by Shepell-fgi, and the warning letters. As mentioned above, the letters from Shepell-fgi and Rogers describe what medical information was missing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  Regarding Mr. Abani's argument that Rogers had an obligation to find him another position given its duty of reasonable accommodation, I am of the opinion that no such duty arises because Mr. Abani did not successfully establish a link between his absences and a medical problem. A duty of reasonable accommodation arises in cases of discrimination ( 
 Hydro- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 9), but no discrimination was established by Mr. Abani. Moreover, the adjudicator noted the various scheduling options that Rogers offered its employees and found that that was enough to meet Mr. Abani's argument about the duty of reasonable accommodation: paras 5 and 39. I am satisfied that this finding was reasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  Before concluding, I would like to mention another argument that was raised at the judicial review hearing. As mentioned above, the adjudicator upheld Mr. Abani's dismissal for two reasons. In addition to Mr. Abani's work absences, the adjudicator found that Mr. Abani's trip outside Canada for two months between September and November 2010, and Mr. Abani's attempt to hide this fact, permanently broke the bond of trust between employer and employee. In Court, Mr. Abani submitted that this finding by the adjudicator was unreasonable because it was not part of the reasons set out by Rogers in the dismissal on April 7, 2011, and thus should not have been considered by the adjudicator. Rogers disagrees. Since I have already found that the adjudicator's decision should be upheld, it is not necessary to look at these arguments in detail or make a finding on this issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 JUDGMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
   
 THE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that 
  the application for judicial review is dismissed and the decision of adjudicator Jean Vézina c.r.i.a. dated September 30, 2013, is upheld, with costs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 .........................  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  un contrôle judiciaire d'une décision d'un tribunal d'arbitrage qui a rejeté une plainte de congédiement de Monsieur Samir Abani.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Le congédiement avait été communiqué à M. Abani par son employeur, le défendeur Rogers Communications Inc. (Rogers) dans une lettre datée du 11 avril 2011. La décision de l'employeur était basée sur un taux d'absentéisme très élevé sur une période d'environ deux ans, et l'employeur n'avait pas confiance que la situation s'améliorera. La lettre du 11 avril 2011 fait référence aussi à plusieurs avis de sensibilisation qui ont été communiqués à M. Abani pendant cette période concernant ses absences.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  M. Abani considère son congédiement injustifié et a déposé une plainte auprès de Ressources humaines et Développement des compétences Canada (RHDCC). Le tribunal d'arbitrage qui a été nommé, l'arbitre Monsieur Jean Vézina, a conclu que Rogers n'a pas été déraisonnable en congédiant M. Abani. L'arbitre a fait référence à plusieurs absences de M. Abani et a accepté la conclusion de Shepell-fgi (une entreprise indépendante qui gère le régime d'invalidité de courte durée de Rogers) que les absences n'étaient pas attribuables à un problème médical. L'arbitre a aussi fait référence à une période de deux mois pendant laquelle M. Abani était à l'extérieur du Canada même après s'être fait refuser ce congé. Selon l'arbitre, ce séjour a brisé définitivement le lien de confiance qui doit exister entre employeur et employé.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  M. Abani allègue que l'arbitre a violé les règles de justice naturelle en ne prenant pas en considération la preuve pertinente qu'il a déposée. Pour les raisons qui suivent, je rejette cette demande de contrôle judiciaire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 I.  
 FAITS  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Le 30 avril 2007, le demandeur a été embauché par Rogers à Toronto. En août 2008, le demandeur a été transféré à Montréal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  Le 1er décembre 2009, un représentant de Rogers a rencontré M. Abani et lui a remis une lettre d'avertissement concernant ses absences non justifiées pour les mois d'août et septembre 2009. Dans la lettre il est indiqué que M. Abani s'est absenté six fois pendant cette période.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Le 2 juillet 2010, M. Abani a reçu une lettre de Shepell-fgi demandant des renseignements médicaux à l'appui de l'incapacité de M. Abani au travail. Dans la lettre il est mentionné que Shepell-fgi confirme l'admissibilité du demandeur pour la période du 27 juin 2010 au 3 juillet 2010 (inclusivement) et a transmis à Rogers un avis à cet effet.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  Le 16 août 2010, M. Abani a demandé trois mois de congé sans solde. Cette demande a été refusée. Malgré ce refus, le 27 août 2010, M. Abani a acheté un billet d'avion pour partir au Maroc pendant deux mois.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  Le 6 septembre 2010, M. Abani a rencontré un psychologue qui lui suggère quatre semaines de repos. Le 9 septembre 2010, M. Abani est parti au Maroc sans avisé Rogers et ce, malgré le refus de sa demande de congé.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Le 29 septembre 2010, le traitement du dossier de M. Abani a été suspendu puisque Shepell-fgi a considéré qu'il n'y avait pas assez de motifs pour accepter la demande de congé d'invalidité de M. Abani. Dans la lettre, il est indiqué que M. Abani demande à son médecin de remplir un rapport médical. Ce rapport a été rempli le 8 octobre 2010 durant l'absence de M. Abani.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  Le 18 octobre 2010, Shepell-fgi a envoyé à M. Abani une lettre indiquant que sa demande de prestations d'invalidité a été refusée. M. Abani est alors informé que Shepell-fgi a étudié sa demande d'invalidité de courte durée et a conclu que les éléments de preuve médicale étaient insuffisants pour justifier son absence du travail à partir du 28 septembre 2010. La lettre indique le processus pour porter cette décision en appel et détaille les nouveaux renseignements médicaux qui devaient être parvenus à Shepell-fgi. Ceux-ci inclus:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Ampleur et gravité des symptômes selon le diagnostic;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Données médicales objectives à l'appui du diagnostic incluant les résultats de tests;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Pronostics en fonction du diagnostic;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Limitations fonctionnelles lui empêchant d'exécuter les tâches essentielles de son poste ou de son assignation temporaire et qui le rend totalement invalide;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Plan de traitement, accompagné d'information sur les résultats à ce jour;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Notes cliniques complètes rédigées par son médecin, thérapeute et d'autres spécialistes consultés à partir du 18 août 2010.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  Le 7 novembre 2010, M. Abani est revenu du Maroc. Le 8 novembre 2010, M. Abani a reçu une lettre de son chef d'équipe, Monsieur Maxime Nivose, l'informant que, selon Rogers, il n'avait pas envoyé les documents justifiant ses absences. Cette lettre indique aussi les renseignements additionnels qui devraient être fournis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  Le 29 novembre 2010, M. Abani a envoyé un autre rapport médical de son médecin pour justifier ses absences. Le 3 décembre 2010, Shepell-fgi a répondu déclarant que les nouveaux renseignements médicaux n'étaient toujours pas suffisants pour justifier ses absences du travail.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Le 7 décembre 2010, Rogers a communiqué une deuxième lettre d'avertissement concernant les absences non justifiées de M. Abani pendant les mois de juillet et août. Il est indiqué que M. Abani a fait 6.55 jours d'absences pendant cette période.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Une troisième lettre d'avertissement a été communiquée à M. Abani le 16 février 2011 concernant ses absences pendant les mois d'avril à novembre 2010. Il est mentionné que M. Abani s'est absenté 86 jours pendant cette période, dont 61 jours pendant les mois de septembre à novembre. Cette lettre indique ce qui suit:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Si des améliorations radicales ne sont pas constatées au cours de ce trimestre, nous allons devoir prendre des mesures plus sévères pouvant aller jusqu'à la résiliation de votre contrat de travail.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Il est impératif que votre assiduité s'améliore ce trimestre, et nous vous demandons de prendre les mesures nécessaires pour y arriver. Sinon, vous risquez de perdre votre emploi.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Malgré les lettres d'avertissement, M. Abani a continué de s'absenter du travail sans justification médicale. Le 24 mars 2011, M. Abani a fourni un autre rapport médical, d'un différent médecin cette fois-ci. Le 29 mars 2011, Shepell-fgi a conclu encore une fois que les éléments de preuve reçus ne validaient pas une absence du travail pour raison médicale.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Le 11 avril 2011, Rogers a mis fin à l'emploi de M. Abani en raison de son incapacité à fournir une prestation régulière au travail.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  Le 23 juin 2011, M. Abani a déposé une plainte auprès de RHDCC - Programme du travail en vertu de l'article 240 du  
 Code canadien du travail 
 , LRC 1985, c. L-2, partie III (congédiement injuste). Le 30 avril 2012, M. Jean Vézina a été nommé par le Service fédéral de médiation et de conciliation pour agir en qualité d'arbitre afin de disposer de cette plainte.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  En tout temps pertinent aux présentes, M. Abani a été représenté par Madame Labib Issa. Il est maintenant représenté par Me Émilie Le-Huy.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Le 28 mai 2012, l'arbitre a convoqué les parties pour audience le 6 septembre 2012. Rogers a présenté sa preuve par le biais du témoignage de deux représentants de Rogers (M. Maxime Nivose, chef d'équipe au service de la clientèle, et Madame Michèle Farley, chef principale pour le service à la clientèle), de même que Madame Sandra Martin, superviseure pour Shepell-fgi. L'avocate de M. Abani a contre-interrogé M. Nivose et Mme. Farley. Elle a choisi de ne pas contre-interroger Mme. Martin.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  La preuve n'étant pas terminée le 6 septembre 2012, l'arbitre a convoqué les parties pour les 10 et 27 mai 2013. Le 10 mai 2013, l'avocate de M. Abani n'a fait entendre qu'un seul témoin dans le cadre de sa preuve, soit M. Abani.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  Le 27 mai 2013, le défendeur a terminé le contre-interrogatoire de M. Abani. Par la suite, l'avocate de M. Abani a annoncé que sa preuve était close. Rogers a ensuite présenté une contre-épreuve par le biais du témoignage de Mme. Michèle Farley. L'avocate de M. Abani a contre-interrogé Mme. Farley.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Le 17 juin 2013, l'arbitre a convoqué les parties pour la présentation de leur argumentation respective le 28 août 2013. L'arbitre a accordé tout le temps voulu à l'avocate de M. Abani pour son argumentation orale et lui a permis de déposer une argumentation écrite avec jurisprudence à son soutien.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  La décision du tribunal d'arbitrage a été rendue le 30 septembre 2013.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II.  
 NORME DE CONTRÔLE  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Tel qu'indiqué ci-haut, M. Abani allègue que l'arbitre a violé les règles de justice naturelle en ne prenant pas en considération la preuve pertinente qu'il a déposée. La norme de contrôle dans un tel cas est celle de la décision correcte. Mais s'il n'y a pas de manquement aux principes de justice naturelle, et qu'il s'agit en réalité d'une attaque sur l'analyse de la preuve par l'arbitre, la norme de contrôle de la décision est celle de la décision raisonnable:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 199.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III.  
 ARGUMENTS DU DEMANDEUR  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  M. Abani soumet que l'arbitre a omis de considérer les documents qu'il a déposés au soutien de sa plainte. Il cite de nombreux rapports envoyés à Rogers suite aux demandes de cette dernière, incluant le rapport de son médecin daté du 29 novembre 2010, ainsi que le rapport de son psychologue daté du 6 septembre 2010.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  M. Abani soumet qu'il a fait les efforts nécessaires pour démontrer le bien-fondé de ses absences du travail, et que Rogers pouvait faire une demande d'évaluation supplémentaire, mais que l'arbitre n'a pas pris ces faits en considération.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  M. Abani allègue que le  
 Manuel de politique 
  de Rogers contient un engagement de trouver un autre poste pour un employé en arrêt de travail temporaire, et soumet que l'arbitre a fait fi de cette clause.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  Finalement, M. Abani fait référence à l'obligation d'accommodement raisonnable de Rogers suivant les enseignements de la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'arrêt  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 ANALYSE ET DÉCISION  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  Je suis satisfait qu'il n'y ait aucun manquement des principes de la justice naturelle dans cette cause. Aucune preuve n'a été exclue, et M. Abani a reçu tous les documents pertinents et a eu toutes les opportunités habituelles de contre-interroger les témoins de Rogers et de présenter son argument.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  En ce qui concerne les rapports médicaux soumis par M. Abani, l'arbitre en était clairement au courant. Il en fait mention aux paragraphes 15 et 17 de sa décision. L'arbitre était clairement en accord avec Shepell-fgi à l'effet que les rapports soumis par M. Abani n'étaient pas suffisants pour justifier ses absences du travail comme étant la cause d'un ou des problèmes médicaux.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  Je note qu'au paragraphe 35 de la décision de l'arbitre, il indique qu'« aucune preuve n'a été faite » sur la question des problèmes de stress au travail de M. Abani. Je comprends de ce paragraphe une déclaration qu'aucune preuve  
 suffisante 
  à cet égard n'a été soumise. Les rapports médicaux ont bien été mis en preuve, mais ils n'étaient pas suffisants. La preuve de M. Abani était basée sur un seul témoin, M. Abani lui-même. Il n'avait aucun témoin ayant une expertise médicale, mais se basait sur les rapports médicaux qui ont été fourni à Rogers.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  À mon avis, l'essence de l'attaque par M. Abani contre la décision de l'arbitre est que l'arbitre n'a pas donné assez de poids à sa preuve et ses arguments. Donc, la norme de contrôle de la décision de l'arbitre est celle de la décision raisonnable. L'arbitre n'a pas fait fi des documents qui étaient mis en preuve. Il n'était simplement pas en accord avec M. Abani au sujet de leur importance.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  Je suis de l'avis que la décision de l'arbitre, en ce qui concerne les absences de M. Abani du travail et l'insuffisance de sa preuve de problème médical est raisonnable. L'arbitre a examiné la preuve de Rogers à cet égard, incluant le rôle de Shepell-fgi. Il a noté les taux d'absences de M. Abani pendant les années 2009 à 2011, l'insuffisance des rapports médicaux soumis par M. Abani malgré les multiples délais accordés par Shepell-fgi, et les lettres d'avertissement. Tel qu'indiqué ci-haut, les lettres de Shepell-fgi et de Rogers détaillaient les renseignements médicaux qui manquaient.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  En ce qui concerne l'argument de M. Abani que Rogers avait une obligation de lui trouver un autre poste suite à une obligation d'accommodement raisonnable, je suis de l'avis qu'aucune telle obligation ne se soulève parce que M. Abani n'a pas réussi à établir un lien entre ses absences et un problème médical. Une obligation d'accommodement raisonnable se soulève dans des cas de discrimination ( 
 Hydro-Québec 
 , ci-dessus au para 9), mais aucune discrimination n'a été établie par M. Abani. De plus, l'arbitre a noté les plusieurs options d'horaires que Rogers offrait à ses employés, et a conclu que ceci suffisait pour répondre à l'argument de M. Abani concernant l'obligation d'accommodement raisonnable: paras 5 et 39. Je suis satisfait que cette conclusion fût raisonnable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  Avant de conclure, je fais mention d'un autre argument qui a été soulevé lors de l'audition de ce contrôle judiciaire. Tel qu'indiqué ci-haut, l'arbitre a confirmé le congédiement de M. Abani pour deux raisons. À part les absences du travail de M. Abani, l'arbitre a conclu que le séjour de M. Abani à l'extérieur du Canada pendant une période de deux mois entre septembre et novembre 2010, ainsi que les efforts de M. Abani de cacher ce fait, a brisé définitivement le lien de confiance qui doit exister entre employeur et employé. Devant moi, M. Abani soumet que cette conclusion de l'arbitre était déraisonnable parce qu'il ne faisait pas partie du raisonnement de Rogers lors du congédiement le 7 avril 2011, et donc n'aurait pas dû être considéré par l'arbitre. Rogers n'est pas d'accord. Puisque j'ai déjà conclu que la décision de l'arbitre doit être confirmée, il n'est pas nécessaire d'entrer en détail des arguments à cet égard, ou de conclure sur cette question.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

[1]
Roy, J.
: The applicant, Mr Hafidh Alawy Aboud, seeks judicial review of a negative Pre-Removal Risk Assessment [PRRA] conducted by a Senior Immigration Officer [PRRA Officer] pursuant to section 112 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. This application for judicial review is made pursuant to section 72 of the IRPA.
[2]
The PRRA Officer determined that the applicant would not be subject to risk of persecution, torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Somalia, on the basis that the applicant had not proven his country of nationality or his identity. In making this decision, the PRRA Officer concluded that much of the material submitted by the applicant was not new evidence and therefore not admissible before him.
[3]
Having carefully considered the parties' written and oral submissions, the Court concludes that the application for judicial review must be dismissed.
I. Facts
[4]
The applicant claims to be a member of the ethnic minority Bajuni clan who lived in Kismayo, Somalia and worked as a fisherman prior to his arrival in Canada. He asserts that, in Somalia, he and his family were regularly targeted and assaulted by members of larger clans following the civil war which began in 1991. He also alleges that, in 2006, Islamic militants tried to recruit him on multiple occasions and forced him to swear allegiance to their cause using threats of violence. Rather than join the militants, the applicant claims that he fled to Kenya on July 20, 2006. His wife and son remained in Kismayo, though he states they have since fled to Kenya.
[5]
While in Kenya, the applicant purports to have met an agent who, in exchange for a fee, provided him with travel documents and arranged his voyage to Canada. The applicant alleges that he arrived in Canada on August 24, 2006, at which point he returned the travel documents to the agent. He then made a claim for refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA, the applicant's first step in what has since become a procedurally lengthy series of decisions made under the IRPA.
[6]
The applicant's refugee claim was rejected by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board [IRB] on August 21, 2008, when it determined that he had not established his identity. Before the RPD, the applicant, who was represented by counsel, had presented no documents to prove who he was, that he was a Somali national, or when he had entered Canada. The RPD further noted that, in spite of being prompted on more than one occasion, he had made little effort to track down any documentation and did not produce any witnesses capable of supporting his identity. The RPD concluded that it had serious credibility concerns about the applicant's testimony before it. In its decision, the RPD also discussed what it characterized as a "further problem" for the applicant, a language analysis report created by a Swedish company called Sprakab (Certified Tribunal Record at page 470). The report had concluded that the variety of Swahili spoken by the applicant could not, with certainty, be found in Somalia but was found, with certainty, in Tanzania. Before the RPD, the applicant disagreed with the language report generally but did not address the specifics contained in it.
[7]
The applicant applied to have the RPD decision judicially reviewed by this Court, but he was not granted leave to do so (file no IMM-4366-08).
[8]
In June of 2009, the applicant filed a PRRA application without any assistance from counsel. He submitted some documentation on the country conditions in Somalia and also provided a statutory declaration from a man named Ally Said Saleh who swore to knowing the applicant in Somalia. The applicant and Mr Saleh are alleged to have reconnected in Canada in September 2008, after the applicant's negative RPD decision. This PRRA was rejected on September 19, 2011 and the applicant was detained in November of that year.
[9]
Following his detention, the applicant retained different counsel and began an application for leave and judicial review of the PRRA decision. Counsel also assisted in the preparation of a second PRRA application. The Crown agreed to defer the applicant's removal from Canada pending this second application and the applicant discontinued his application for judicial review of the first PRRA decision in January of 2012 (file no IMM-8559-11).
[10]
The applicant's second PRRA was rejected on December 14, 2011; again the applicant applied for judicial review. Prior to the matter being heard by this Court, the Crown again agreed to re-determine the PRRA because some further submissions made by the applicant prior to the negative decision being communicated to him had not been received and considered by the PRRA Officer. Again, the applicant discontinued his application for judicial review in light of the offered re-determination (file no IMM-1591-12).
II. The Decision under Review
[11]
On September 4, 2012, the PRRA Officer whose decision is the subject of this judicial review wrote to the applicant and indicated that he would "consider all PRRA submissions and evidence made in the PRRA in the application submitted on 29 November 2011 and all subsequent PRRA evidence and submissions submitted up until the time that I render a PRRA decision" (Certified Tribunal Record at page 38).
[12]
The applicant filed additional submissions that were received by Citizenship and Immigration Canada on October 9, 2012 and October 18, 2012. The applicant put before the PRRA Officer copious documents, including submissions from counsel, an affidavit from the applicant, additional statutory declarations and affidavits from individuals supporting the applicant's claimed identity, a letter purportedly from the applicant's wife, a psychological assessment of the applicant, and updated country conditions packages for Somalia. In addition to these submissions, the applicant also obtained a report from Dr Derek Nurse, a professor
emeritus
of linguistics at Memorial University; this report was intended to find fault with the findings of the Sprakab language analysis which had been before the RPD.
[13]
On October 22, 2012, the PRRA Officer rejected the applicant's PRRA application. Following additional submissions by the applicant, the PRRA Officer confirmed the negative decision on November 13, 2012, subject to two typographical clarifications.
[14]
In his decision, having noted that the IRB had found the applicant generally not credible regarding his identity, his nationality and his alleged mistreatment, the PRRA Officer addressed the evidence submitted by the applicant and rejected most of it as being inadmissible before him on the basis that it was not put forward by the applicant either at the RPD hearing or prior to the applicant's first PRRA, as required by subsection 113(a) of the IRPA and the doctrine of issue estoppel. Where the PRRA Officer rejected evidence for either or both of these reasons, he also conducted an alternative analysis to reject the evidence for being of little or no probative value in establishing the applicant's identity as that of a Bajuni or as a Somali national. The evidence which the PRRA Officer did accept as new - and therefore admissible - evidence was also determined to be of little or no probative value in establishing the applicant's identity. As such, the PRRA Officer maintained the RPD's finding that the applicant was not sufficiently credible regarding his identity or nationality. As that the applicant had not provided sufficient new admissible evidence to displace the RPD's credibility finding, the PRRA Officer also determined that there was no credibility issue regarding the applicant such that an oral hearing was necessary.
[15]
In addressing the risk of returning the applicant to Somalia, the PRRA Officer found that the applicant only faced a generalized risk were he to be returned to Somalia and that he had not sufficiently demonstrated with probative evidence that he would be subject to individualized risk. The PRRA Officer also noted that since the applicant's status as a Somali national had not been established but was only alleged, the country conditions of Somalia were not relevant to the PRRA.
III. Analysis
[16]
The applicant argues that this Court should quash the PRRA Officer's decision and remit the matter for redetermination, arguing that the PRRA Officer applied the wrong test to the evidence submitted by the applicant and came to an unreasonable decision. The applicant also argues that he was denied procedural fairness when the PRRA Officer did not grant him an oral interview.
[17]
Although neither party explicitly made submissions as to the standard of review applicable to the PRRA at hand, both appear to accept a reasonableness standard. I agree. A decision maker interpreting and applying his or her home statute is presumptively entitled to deference on review:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 19 to 22;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 50;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 54 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. There is no reason to rebut this presumption where a PRRA Officer is assessing applications before him or her.
[18]
I do note, though, that in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at paragraph 3, the Federal Court of Appeal accepted the standards of review of correctness for questions of law, patent unreasonableness for questions of fact, and reasonableness for questions of fact and law relating to subsection 113(a) of the IRPA. However, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> does predate the seminal case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and has been superseded by that case and the subsequent jurisprudence on the standard of review. Post- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> jurisprudence from this Court reflects a reasonableness standard for similar decisions:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Singh
].
[19]
The standard of review of "[r]easonableness is a deferential standard animated by the principle that underlies the development of the two previous standards of reasonableness: certain questions that come before administrative tribunals do not lend themselves to one specific, particular result." The inquiry of the reviewing court will be focused on that notion of reasonableness that is "concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law:" <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 47.
[20]
Making a PRRA application permits a person who is subject to a removal order to apply for protection; the effect of a successful PRRA is to confer refugee protection on the applicant: sections 112 and 114 of the IRPA. It is well-established that a PRRA is not an opportunity for an applicant to appeal or seek reconsideration of an RPD decision that rejected his or her claim for refugee protection: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 12;
Singh
at paragraph 1;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Indeed, in the words of the Federal Court of Appeal in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 13, the outcome of a negative refugee determination "must be respected by the PRRA officer" in the absence of new admissible evidence that might have affected that outcome. Subsection 113(a) of the IRPA prescribes the evidence which an applicant can submit, essentially limiting the applicant to new evidence that was not available or was not reasonably available to him or her at the time where the claim to refugee protection was rejected, or to evidence that the applicant could not have been reasonably expected to present at that hearing:
Consideration of application
113. Consideration of an application for protection shall be as follows:
(a) an applicant whose claim to refugee protection has been rejected may present only new evidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available, or that the applicant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection;
Examen de la demande
113. Il est disposé de la demande comme il suit:
a) le demandeur d'asile débouté ne peut présenter que des éléments de preuve survenus depuis le rejet ou qui n'étaient alors pas normalement accessibles ou, s'ils l'étaient, qu'il n'était pas raisonnable, dans les circonstances, de s'attendre à ce qu'il les ait présentés au moment du rejet;
[21]
In the case at hand, the applicant has largely sought to reargue the RPD's negative credibility decision, both before the PRRA Officer and before this Court. Counsel for the applicant has worked diligently to amass statutory declarations, affidavits, and other evidence in an attempt to support the applicant's purported identity. Counsel has obtained a substantive linguistic report aimed at an attempt to dismantle the negative credibility findings surrounding the applicant's identity. This is not sufficient, however, to render the PRRA Officer's decision unreasonable, where that evidence is not properly admissible. Indeed, I have concluded that the probative value of that evidence, if it were new, could reasonably have been found to have low probative value once examined with appropriate care, as was done in this case.
[22]
The analytical framework covering evidence put forward in a PRRA application where the applicant has previously lost a claim for refugee protection is set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 13 and 14. They read:
[13] As I read paragraph 113(
a
), it is based on the premise that a negative refugee determination by the RPD must be respected by the PRRA officer, unless there is new evidence of facts that might have affected the outcome of the RPD hearing if the evidence had been presented to the RPD. Paragraph 113(
a
) asks a number of questions, some expressly and some by necessary implication, about the proposed new evidence. I summarize those questions as follows:
1.
Credibility
: Is the evidence credible, considering its source and the circumstances in which it came into existence? If not, the evidence need not be considered.
2.
Relevance
: Is the evidence relevant to the PRRA application, in the sense that it is capable of proving or disproving a fact that is relevant to the claim for protection? If not, the evidence need not be considered.
3.
Newness
: Is the evidence new in the sense that it is capable of
(a) proving the current state of affairs in the country of removal or an event that occurred or a circumstance that arose after the hearing in the RPD, or
(b) proving a fact that was unknown to the refugee claimant at the time of the RPD hearing, or
(c) contradicting a finding of fact by the RPD (including a credibility finding)?
If not, the evidence need not be considered.
4.
Materiality
: Is the evidence material, in the sense that the refugee claim probably would have succeeded if the evidence had been made available to the RPD? If not, the evidence need not be considered.
5.
Express statutory conditions
:
(a) If the evidence is capable of proving only an event that occurred or circumstances that arose prior to the RPD hearing, then has the applicant established either that the evidence was not reasonably available to him or her for presentation at the RPD hearing, or that he or she could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence at the RPD hearing? If not, the evidence need not be considered.
(b) If the evidence is capable of proving an event that occurred or circumstances that arose after the RPD hearing, then the evidence must be considered (unless it is rejected because it is not credible, not relevant, not new or not material).
[14] The first four questions, relating to credibility, relevance, newness and materiality, are necessarily implied from the purpose of paragraph 113(
a
) within the statutory scheme of the IRPA relating to refugee claims and pre removal risk assessments. The remaining questions are asked expressly by paragraph 113(
a
).
[23]
Justice Sharlow, writing for the Federal Court of Appeal, held that evidence must satisfy four conditions that are necessarily implied by subsection 113(a) within the statutory scheme of the IRPA and two express statutory conditions set out in that provision for it to be admissible in a PRRA. Evidence submitted must be, by necessary implication, credible, relevant, new, and material; the express statutory conditions also require it to be capable of proving an event or circumstances that arose after the refugee claim was rejected, or in the case of an event or circumstances that arose prior to the rejection, the evidence must have not been reasonably available to the applicant for presentation at that hearing or such that the applicant could not have reasonably been expected to present it. Where evidence submitted in a PRRA application fails to meet any of these conditions, it need not be considered by the PRRA Officer.
[24]
The PRRA Officer's decision that the evidence submitted by the applicant was not admissible was reasonable. When assessing whether evidence satisfies the newness requirement, the date on which it was created is not determinative, rather "[w] hat is important is the event or circumstance sought to be proved by the documentary evidence": <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 16.
[25]
In the applicant's case, he lost a claim for refugee protection before the RPD by reason of being unable to satisfactorily prove his identity. Many years later, his identity remains cloudy. The
onus
to produce acceptable documentation establishing a claimant's identity is on the claimant himself or herself:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The applicant's status as a Somali national, or the lack thereof, is a circumstance that arose prior to the RPD hearing. As such, per <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 13, the applicant can only present evidence proving his nationality where he can establish "that the evidence was not reasonably available to him ... for presentation at the RPD hearing, or that he ... could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence at the RPD hearing."
[26]
Where an individual seeks to submit evidence that he or she alleges is new, the individual must provide a "compelling argument as to why [it] constitutes 'new', and therefore admissible evidence" and without such an argument, there is no reviewable error in the PRRA Officer's decision to reject it:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[27]
In his submissions to this Court, the applicant suggests that the evidence only reasonably became available when his current counsel was able to assist him to obtain it:
In this case, the Applicant provided evidence that was only reasonably available at the time of his second PRRA, when counsel was able to engage the assistance of a Bajuni interpreter and an expert in linguistics. Furthermore, the Applicant was finally able to obtain a letter from his wife, and a new witness to his identity was willing to come forward. These circumstances, in addition to the fact that the Applicant was unrepresented at the time of his first PRRA, were put before the officer and explained why the evidence was new.
(Applicant's Memorandum of Fact and Law at paragraph 32)
[28]
This explanation is not "compelling" and it does not render the PRRA Officer's decision unreasonable. Although the applicant was unrepresented at the time he made his first PRRA application, he was represented by counsel before the RPD. The RPD pressed the applicant for evidence to support his identity, but none was forthcoming either from the applicant or from his counsel. Indeed, a tactical decision was taken between the applicant and his counsel not to bring a witness to the RPD hearing to speak to his purported identity, apparently on the basis that the potential witness may have had credibility issues himself.
[29]
Whether owing to a lack of diligent effort or to strategic choices, the applicant failed to produce evidence capable of establishing his identity before the RPD. That is critical as well as basic. Having counsel now that is better able or more willing to track down persons to make statutory declarations, affidavits, linguistics reports, etc. is not a compelling argument that this evidence should have been admissible before the PRRA Officer. That would be enough to dispose of the application.
[30]
I would add that the Nurse report is largely a red herring once a finding about the identity of the applicant has been made. Furthermore, although the Nurse report was commissioned only after the applicant retained his current counsel, this does not mean that it is new evidence, admissible pursuant to subsection 113(a) of the IRPA. On the contrary, as previously discussed per <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 16, the event sought to be proved by the document, rather than the document's time of creation, is what determines if it is new. The Sprakab report that it seeks to counter came into being in 2007; the RPD hearing was the time where the Nurse report, or a similar rebuttal to the Sprakab report, would have been properly admissible. The rejection of the Nurse report was in my view a reasonable decision. The PRRA Officer went on to consider the Nurse report and he concluded that the Sprakab report was more persuasive. That is a conclusion that was reasonably open for the PRRA Officer to reach. Thus, if corroborative evidence was needed, and it was not, it could have been found in the Sprakab report as its probative value could reasonably be seen to be superior to the Nurse report.
[31]
The question remains as to whether evidence submitted by the applicant is admissible where that evidence was not available or reasonably available at the time of the RPD hearing but was available or reasonably available at the time of the applicant's first PRRA application. I find that the decision to reject this evidence was reasonable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 41, the Federal Court of Appeal was clear that "an application for protection under section 112 is an application for refugee protection." As such, a prior PRRA meets the statutory language of subsection 113(a); it is a "claim to refugee protection [that] has been rejected." Indeed, this Court has applied subsection 113(a) to limit the admissibility of evidence submitted in subsequent PRRA applications:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[32]
I now turn to the overall reasonableness of the PRRA Officer's decision and I conclude that it was a reasonable decision, within the articulation of that standard in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. Given the applicant's failure to put before the PRRA Officer admissible evidence that was capable of challenging the RPD decision, the PRRA Officer did not displace the RPD decision regarding the applicant's credibility. The applicant simply has not proven his identity as a Somali national. Without proof of identity, the risks alleged by the applicant should he be removed to Somalia are not relevant to the PRRA. Without first establishing his identity, he cannot make out a well-founded fear of persecution or risk requiring that he be deemed a protected person:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[33]
In addition to determining that the applicant had not adduced new admissible evidence, the PRRA Officer also conducted alternative analyses regarding the probative value of the information. In doing so, he determined that the evidence, assuming for the sake of argument that the evidence submitted by the applicant was admissible, was of no or little probative value to the determination of his identity. This Court has reviewed that same evidence in order to ascertain its probative value. As the Court has noted previously "[d] eference must be given to PRRA officers in their assessment of the probative value of the evidence before them":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Ferguson
]. With deference in mind, the PRRA falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible on the facts and law. The burden was on the applicant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the PRRA Officer's decision was not reasonable. Without probative evidence, this burden cannot be discharged. The PRRA Officer's overall decision was reasonable.
[34]
Finally, the applicant has also argued before the Court that his rights to procedural fairness were breached when the PRRA Officer declined to interview him. Questions of whether a decision maker complied with the duty of procedural fairness are reviewable on a correctness standard:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 79.
[35]
The applicant submits that the PRRA Officer effectively challenged the credibility of the applicant's evidence, which entitles him to an oral hearing. This, however, is a mischaracterization of the PRRA Officer's decision. The officer merely concluded that the identity of the applicant was not established before the RPD and the evidence before him did not displace that finding, whether that evidence is admissible or not. As discussed above, a PRRA Officer is to respect findings made by the RPD unless there is new, properly admissible evidence that might have affected the RPD decision. Determining whether there is sufficient admissible evidence to establish the applicant's identity is not itself a question of credibility. Being unconvinced by the evidence before him or her because of its low probative value is not the same as a PRRA Officer questioning an applicant's credibility:
Ferguson
at paragraph 33. It is well-established that oral hearings in PRRA applications are required only in exceptional circumstances: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 41;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The applicant's case is not exceptional in this regard, and the duty of procedural fairness does not entitle him to an oral hearing.
IV. Conclusion
[36]
The application for judicial review is dismissed. The parties did not submit a serious question of general importance and no question for certification arises.
JUDGMENT
[37]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no question for certification.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Hafidh Alawy Aboud, demande le contrôle judiciaire de la décision défavorable rendue relativement à un examen des risques avant renvoi [l'ERAR] effectué par un agent principal [l'agent d'ERAR] en vertu de l'article 112 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR]. Cette demande est présentée sous le régime de l'article 72 de la LIPR.
[2]
L'agent d'ERAR a déterminé que le demandeur ne serait pas exposé au risque de persécution ou de torture, à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités s'il était renvoyé en Somalie, car il n'avait pas fait la preuve de son pays de nationalité ou de son identité. En rendant cette décision, l'agent d'ERAR a conclu que de nombreux éléments produits par le demandeur n'étaient pas nouveaux, de sorte qu'ils n'étaient pas admissibles devant lui.
[3]
Ayant examiné avec soin les prétentions présentées par les parties par écrit et de vive voix, la Cour conclut que la demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être rejetée.
I. Les faits
[4]
Le demandeur prétend appartenir au clan de la minorité ethnique Bajuni. Il vivait à Kismayo, en Somalie, et travaillait comme pêcheur avant son arrivée au Canada. Il affirme que, en Somalie, sa famille et lui étaient régulièrement pris pour cibles et agressés par des membres de clans plus grands à la suite de la guerre civile qui a commencé en 1991. Il allègue en outre qu'en 2006 des militants islamiques ont essayé de le recruter à maintes reprises et l'ont forcé, en proférant des menaces de violence à son endroit, à leur prêter allégeance afin qu'il défende leur cause. Au lieu de se joindre aux militants, le demandeur se serait enfui au Kenya le 20 juillet 2006. Sa femme et son fils sont demeurés à Kismayo. Le demandeur affirme qu'ils se sont enfuis au Kenya depuis.
[5]
Pendant qu'il était au Kenya, le demandeur aurait rencontré un agent qui, en échange d'une somme d'argent, lui a remis des documents de voyage et a organisé son voyage au Canada. Il allègue qu'il est arrivé au Canada le 24 août 2006 et qu'il a retourné les documents de voyage à l'agent à ce moment-là. Il a alors présenté une demande d'asile en vertu des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR. Il s'agit de la première démarche entreprise par le demandeur dans le cadre de ce qui a mené à une longue série de décisions rendues sous le régime de la LIPR.
[6]
La Section de la protection des réfugiés [la SPR] de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [la CISR] a rejeté la demande d'asile du demandeur le 21 août 2008, au motif que celui-ci n'avait pas établi son identité. Le demandeur, qui était représenté par un conseil devant la SPR, n'a présenté à celle-ci aucun document établissant son identité ou démontrant qu'il était un ressortissant somalien ou à quel moment il était arrivé au Canada. La SPR a souligné que, malgré le fait qu'il avait réagi rapidement à plus d'une occasion, le demandeur avait fait peu d'efforts pour trouver des documents et n'avait fait témoigner personne en mesure d'attester son identité. Elle a conclu qu'elle avait de sérieux doutes quant à la crédibilité du témoignage du demandeur. Dans sa décision, elle a aussi parlé de ce qu'elle a qualifié de [traduction] « problème additionnel » pour le demandeur, un rapport d'analyse du langage émanant d'une société suédoise appelée Sprakab (dossier certifié du tribunal, à la page 470). Selon ce rapport, il ne faisait aucun doute que le type de swahili parlé par le demandeur n'était pas parlé en Somalie, mais qu'il l'était assurément en Tanzanie. Devant la SPR, le demandeur a contesté le rapport de manière générale, sans toutefois traiter des détails qu'il contenait.
[7]
Le demandeur a présenté à la Cour une demande de contrôle judiciaire visant la décision de la SPR, mais il n'a pas obtenu l'autorisation nécessaire à cette fin (dossier no IMM-4366-08).
[8]
En juin 2009, le demandeur a présenté une demande d'ERAR sans l'aide d'un conseil. Il a produit des documents sur les conditions existant en Somalie, ainsi qu'une déclaration solennelle signée par un homme appelé Ally Said Saleh, dans laquelle celui-ci jurait connaître le demandeur en Somalie. Le demandeur et M. Saleh auraient repris contact au Canada en septembre 2008, après la décision défavorable de la SPR. La demande d'ERAR a fait l'objet d'une décision défavorable le 19 septembre 2011 et le demandeur a été placé en détention au mois de novembre suivant.
[9]
Après sa détention, le demandeur a retenu les services d'un autre conseil et a présenté une demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire visant la décision relative à l'ERAR. Le conseil l'a aussi aidé à préparer une deuxième demande d'ERAR. L'État a accepté de surseoir au renvoi du demandeur du Canada pendant l'examen de cette deuxième demande et le demandeur s'est désisté de sa demande de contrôle judiciaire visant la première décision relative à l'ERAR en janvier 2012 (dossier no IMM-8559-11).
[10]
La deuxième demande d'ERAR du demandeur a fait l'objet d'une décision défavorable le 14 décembre 2011. Le demandeur a encore une fois présenté une demande de contrôle judiciaire. Avant que l'affaire soit instruite par la Cour, l'État a accepté de réexaminer cette demande d'ERAR également, en vue de rendre éventuellement une autre décision, parce que l'agent d'ERAR n'avait pas reçu et pris en considération certaines prétentions additionnelles qui avaient été formulées par le demandeur avant que la décision défavorable ne lui soit communiquée. Le demandeur s'est désisté de sa demande de contrôle judiciaire après que l'État a offert de revoir son dossier (dossier no IMM-1591-12).
II. La décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle
[11]
Le 4 septembre 2012, l'agent d'ERAR qui a rendu la décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle judiciaire a écrit au demandeur qu'il [traduction] « prendrait en compte toutes les prétentions et la preuve relatives à l'ERAR contenues dans la demande d'ERAR présentée le 29 novembre 2011, ainsi que toute la preuve et toutes les prétentions concernant l'ERAR qui me seront présentées jusqu'au moment où je rendrai ma décision relativement à l'ERAR » (dossier certifié du tribunal, à la page 38).
[12]
Le demandeur a déposé des prétentions additionnelles qui ont été reçues par Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada les 9 et 18 octobre 2012. Il a transmis de nombreux documents à l'agent d'ERAR, notamment des observations de son conseil, un affidavit qu'il a lui-même signé, des déclarations solennelles et des affidavits additionnels de personnes attestant qu'il est bien la personne qu'il dit être, ainsi qu'une lettre qui aurait été écrite par sa femme, une évaluation psychologique le concernant et des documents à jour sur les conditions existant en Somalie. Le demandeur a aussi obtenu un rapport d'un professeur émérite de linguistique de la Memorial University, M. Derek Nurse. Ce rapport avait pour but de relever des erreurs dans les conclusions de l'analyse du langage effectuée par Sprakab qui avaient été présentées à la SPR.
[13]
Le 22 octobre 2012, l'agent d'ERAR a rendu une décision défavorable relativement à la demande d'ERAR du demandeur. Après avoir pris connaissance des prétentions additionnelles présentées par ce dernier, l'agent d'ERAR a confirmé sa décision le 13 novembre 2012, sous réserve de deux clarifications typographiques.
[14]
Après avoir rappelé dans sa décision que la CISR avait conclu que le demandeur n'était pas crédible de façon générale en ce qui concernait son identité, sa nationalité et les mauvais traitements dont il aurait été victime, l'agent d'ERAR a examiné les éléments de preuve produits par le demandeur. Il a rejeté la plupart de ces éléments de preuve au motif qu'ils n'étaient pas admissibles devant lui parce qu'ils n'avaient pas été produits par le demandeur lors de l'audience de la SPR ou avant la tenue de son premier ERAR, contrairement à ce qu'exigent l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR et la doctrine de la préclusion découlant d'une question déjà tranchée. Lorsqu'il a rejeté des éléments de preuve pour l'une ou l'autre de ces raisons, l'agent d'ERAR a effectué une autre analyse dans le but de les rejeter au motif qu'ils avaient une faible valeur probante, voire aucune, en ce qui concerne l'établissement de l'identité du demandeur en tant que Bajuni ou de ressortissant somalien. Les éléments de preuve que l'agent d'ERAR a admis à juste titre parce qu'ils étaient nouveaux avaient aussi, selon lui, une faible force probante, voire aucune, pour ce qui est de l'établissement de l'identité du demandeur. En conséquence, l'agent d'ERAR a maintenu la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle le demandeur n'était pas suffisamment crédible au regard de son identité ou de sa nationalité. Le demandeur n'ayant pas produit de nouveaux éléments de preuve admissibles suffisants pour réfuter la conclusion relative à la crédibilité à laquelle la SPR était parvenue, l'agent d'ERAR a aussi déterminé qu'il n'existait aucun problème de crédibilité justifiant la tenue d'une audience.
[15]
En ce qui concerne le risque lié au renvoi du demandeur en Somalie, l'agent d'ERAR a conclu qu'il serait exposé seulement à un risque généralisé s'il était renvoyé en Somalie et qu'il n'avait pas produit une preuve probante démontrant qu'il serait personnellement exposé à un risque. L'agent d'ERAR a aussi mentionné que, comme le fait que le demandeur était un ressortissant somalien n'avait pas été établi, mais seulement allégué, il n'avait pas à tenir compte des conditions existant en Somalie dans le cadre de l'ERAR.
III. Analyse
[16]
Le demandeur soutient que la Cour devrait annuler la décision de l'agent d'ERAR et renvoyer l'affaire pour qu'elle fasse l'objet d'une nouvelle décision, parce que l'agent d'ERAR n'a pas appliqué le bon critère à la preuve qu'il a produite et qu'il a rendu une décision déraisonnable. Il soutient également qu'il n'a pas eu droit à l'équité procédurale parce que l'agent d'ERAR ne lui a pas accordé une entrevue.
[17]
Bien qu'elles n'aient pas présenté expressément d'observations relativement à la norme de contrôle applicable à la décision relative à l'ERAR en cause en l'espèce, les deux parties semblent convenir que c'est la norme de la raisonnabilité qui s'applique. Je suis aussi de cet avis. Un décideur qui interprète et applique sa loi constitutive est présumé avoir droit à la déférence en cas de contrôle judiciaire:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 19 à 22;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 50;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 54 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Il n'y a aucune raison que cette présomption soit réfutée lorsqu'un agent d'ERAR étudie des demandes qui lui sont présentées.
[18]
Je rappelle cependant qu'au paragraphe 3 de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], la Cour d'appel fédérale a admis que la norme de contrôle de la décision correcte s'applique aux questions de droit, celle de la décision manifestement déraisonnable aux questions de fait et celle de la raisonnabilité aux questions de droit et de fait relatives à l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR. L'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> est toutefois antérieur à <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , l'arrêt faisant autorité sur cette question, et a été remplacé par celui-ci et par la jurisprudence subséquente sur le sujet. La Cour a statué que la norme de la raisonnabilité s'applique au type de décision en cause en l'espèce dans des arrêts postérieurs à <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Singh
].
[19]
« La norme déférente du caractère raisonnable procède du principe à l'origine des deux normes antérieures de raisonnabilité: certaines questions soumises aux tribunaux administratifs n'appellent pas une seule solution précise, mais peuvent plutôt donner lieu à un certain nombre de conclusions raisonnables. » L'analyse de la cour de révision portera sur cette notion de raisonnabilité qui « tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit »: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47.
[20]
La présentation d'une demande d'ERAR permet à une personne faisant l'objet d'une mesure de renvoi de demander la protection. Si la demande de protection est accordée, l'asile est conféré au demandeur: articles 112 et 114 de la LIPR. Il est bien établi qu'une demande d'ERAR ne constitue pas un appel ni un réexamen de la décision de la SPR de rejeter une demande d'asile: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 12;
Singh
, au paragraphe 1;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . En fait, comme la Cour d'appel fédérale l'a indiqué au paragraphe 13 de <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , « l'agent d'ERAR doit prendre acte » de la décision défavorable rendue relativement à une demande d'asile en l'absence de nouveaux éléments de preuve admissibles qui auraient pu avoir une incidence sur l'issue de cette demande. L'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR décrit les éléments de preuve qu'un demandeur peut produire. Il s'agit essentiellement d'éléments de preuve qui n'étaient pas disponibles ou qui n'étaient pas normalement accessibles au moment du rejet de sa demande d'asile ou, s'ils l'étaient, qu'il n'était pas raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'il les ait présentés lors de l'audition de cette demande:
Examen de la demande
113. Il est disposé de la demande comme il suit:
a) le demandeur d'asile débouté ne peut présenter que des éléments de preuve survenus depuis le rejet ou qui n'étaient alors pas normalement accessibles ou, s'ils l'étaient, qu'il n'était pas raisonnable, dans les circonstances, de s'attendre à ce qu'il les ait présentés au moment du rejet;
Consideration of application
113. Consideration of an application for protection shall be as follows:
(a) an applicant whose claim to refugee protection has been rejected may present only new evidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available, or that the applicant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection;
[21]
En l'espèce, le demandeur a cherché largement à remettre en question la décision défavorable rendue par la SPR relativement à la crédibilité, à la fois devant l'agent d'ERAR et devant la Cour. Son avocate a travaillé avec diligence afin de rassembler des déclarations solennelles, des affidavits et d'autres éléments de preuve devant servir à attester la présumée identité du demandeur. Elle a obtenu un rapport d'analyse du langage approfondi visant à réfuter les conclusions défavorables relatives à la crédibilité concernant son identité. Cela n'est toutefois pas suffisant pour que la décision de l'agent d'ERAR soit déraisonnable, car ces éléments de preuve ne sont pas admissibles. En fait, j'ai conclu qu'on aurait pu raisonnablement considérer, s'ils étaient nouveaux, qu'ils avaient une faible valeur probante après les avoir examinés de manière appropriée, comme cela a été fait en l'espèce.
[22]
Le cadre analytique applicable à la preuve produite dans le cadre d'une demande d'ERAR par un demandeur d'asile qui a été débouté est décrit aux paragraphes 13 et 14 de <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[13] Selon son interprétation de l'alinéa 113
a
), cet alinéa repose sur l'idée que l'agent d'ERAR doit prendre acte de la décision de la SPR de rejeter la demande d'asile, à moins que des preuves nouvelles soient survenues depuis le rejet, qui auraient pu conduire la SPR à statuer autrement si elle en avait eu connaissance. L'alinéa 113
a
) pose plusieurs questions, certaines explicitement et d'autres implicitement, concernant les preuves nouvelles en question. Je les résume ainsi:
1.
Crédibilité
: Les preuves nouvelles sont-elles crédibles, compte tenu de leur source et des circonstances dans lesquelles elles sont apparues? Dans la négative, il n'est pas nécessaire de les considérer.
2.
Pertinence
: Les preuves nouvelles intéressent-elles la demande d'ERAR, c'est-à-dire sont-elles aptes à prouver ou à réfuter un fait qui intéresse la demande d'asile? Dans la négative, il n'est pas nécessaire de les considérer.
3.
Nouveauté
: Les preuves sont-elles nouvelles, c'est-à-dire sont-elles aptes:
a) à prouver la situation ayant cours dans le pays de renvoi, ou un événement ou fait postérieur à l'audition de la demande d'asile?
b) à établir un fait qui n'était pas connu du demandeur d'asile au moment de l'audition de sa demande d'asile?
c) à réfuter une conclusion de fait tirée par la SPR (y compris une conclusion touchant la crédibilité)?
Dans la négative, il n'est pas nécessaire de les considérer.
4.
Caractère substantiel
: Les preuves nouvelles sont-elles substantielles, c'est-à-dire la demande d'asile aurait-elle probablement été accordée si elles avaient été portées à la connaissance de la SPR? Dans la négative, il n'est pas nécessaire de les considérer.
5.
Conditions légales explicites
:
a) Si les preuves nouvelles sont aptes à établir uniquement un fait qui s'est produit ou des circonstances qui ont existé avant l'audition de la demande d'asile, alors le demandeur a-t-il établi que les preuves nouvelles ne lui étaient pas normalement accessibles lors de l'audition de la demande d'asile, ou qu'il ne serait pas raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'il les ait présentées lors de l'audition de la demande d'asile? Dans la négative, il n'est pas nécessaire de les considérer.
b) Si les preuves nouvelles sont aptes à établir un fait qui s'est produit ou les circonstances qui ont existé après l'audition de la demande d'asile, alors elles doivent être considérées (sauf si elles sont rejetées parce qu'elles ne sont pas crédibles, pas pertinentes, pas nouvelles ou pas substantielles).
[14] Les quatre premières questions, qui concernent la crédibilité, la pertinence, la nouveauté et le caractère substantiel, résultent implicitement de l'objet de l'alinéa 113
a
), dans le régime de la LIPR se rapportant aux demandes d'asile et aux examens des risques avant renvoi. Les questions restantes sont posées explicitement par l'alinéa 113
a
).
[23]
La juge Sharlow, qui a rédigé l'arrêt au nom de la Cour d'appel fédérale, a statué que, pour être admissibles dans le cadre d'un ERAR, les éléments de preuve doivent satisfaire à quatre conditions qui résultent implicitement de l'alinéa 113
a
) dans le régime de la LIPR, ainsi qu'à deux conditions prévues expressément par cette disposition. Ainsi, les éléments de preuve doivent, par déduction nécessaire, être crédibles, pertinents, nouveaux et substantiels; les conditions légales explicites exigent également qu'ils soient aptes à établir un fait qui s'est produit ou des circonstances qui ont existé après le rejet de la demande d'asile ou, dans le cas d'un fait ou de circonstances qui ont existé avant le rejet de cette demande, qu'ils n'aient pas été normalement accessibles au demandeur lors de l'audition de la demande d'asile ou qu'il n'ait pas pu être raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que celui-ci les présente. Les éléments de preuve produits dans le cadre d'une demande d'ERAR qui ne satisfont pas à ces conditions ne seront pas pris en compte par l'agent d'ERAR.
[24]
La décision de l'agent d'ERAR portant que les éléments de preuve produits par le demandeur n'étaient pas admissibles était raisonnable. La date à laquelle un élément de preuve a été créé n'est pas déterminante pour trancher la question de savoir si cet élément de preuve satisfait à l'exigence du caractère nouveau. En fait, « [c] e qui importe, c'est le fait ou les circonstances que l'on cherche à établir par la preuve documentaire »: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 16.
[25]
En l'espèce, la SPR a rejeté la demande d'asile du demandeur parce qu'il n'était pas en mesure de prouver son identité de manière satisfaisante. Son identité demeure encore nébuleuse des années plus tard. Or, il incombe au demandeur d'asile de présenter des documents acceptables établissant son identité:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Le statut de ressortissant somalien du demandeur - ou l'absence de ce statut - existait avant l'audience de la SPR. En conséquence, conformément au paragraphe 13 de <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le demandeur ne peut présenter une preuve établissant sa nationalité que s'il peut établir que « les preuves nouvelles ne lui étaient pas normalement accessibles lors de l'audition de la demande d'asile, ou qu'il ne serait pas raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'il les ait présentées lors de l'audition de la demande d'asile ».
[26]
La personne qui veut présenter des éléments de preuve qu'elle dit être nouveaux doit présenter un « argument convaincant qui explique pourquoi [ces éléments] constitu[ent] une "nouvelle" preuve qui est donc admissible »; en l'absence d'un argument de cette nature, la décision de l'agent d'ERAR de rejeter la preuve ne contient aucune erreur susceptible de contrôle:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[27]
Dans les prétentions qu'il a présentées à la Cour, le demandeur laisse entendre que les éléments de preuve ne sont devenus normalement accessibles que lorsque son avocate actuelle a été en mesure de l'aider à les obtenir:
[traduction] En l'espèce, le demandeur a produit des éléments de preuve qui ne sont devenus normalement accessibles qu'au moment de son deuxième ERAR, lorsque son conseil a été en mesure d'obtenir l'aide d'un interprète Bajuni et d'un expert en linguistique. En outre, le demandeur a finalement pu obtenir une lettre de sa femme et un nouveau témoin a accepté d'attester son identité. Ces faits, qui s'ajoutent au fait que le demandeur n'était pas représenté par un conseil à l'époque de son premier ERAR, ont été exposés à l'agent et expliquaient pourquoi les éléments de preuve étaient nouveaux.
(Mémoire des faits et du droit du demandeur, au paragraphe 32)
[28]
Cette explication n'est pas « convaincante » et ne fait pas en sorte que la décision de l'agent d'ERAR est déraisonnable. Si le demandeur n'était pas représenté par un conseil au moment où il a présenté sa première demande d'ERAR, il l'était devant la SPR. Celle-ci a pressé le demandeur de présenter une preuve attestant son identité, mais aucune preuve de cette nature n'a été produite par le demandeur ou par son conseil. En fait, le demandeur et son conseil ont pris la décision stratégique de n'appeler aucun témoin capable d'attester sa présumée identité à l'audience de la SPR, apparemment parce que la crédibilité de cette personne aurait aussi pu poser problème.
[29]
Que ce soit par manque de diligence ou en raison de choix stratégiques, le demandeur n'a pas produit une preuve établissant son identité devant la SPR. Cette absence de preuve est à la fois déterminante et fondamentale. Le fait de compter maintenant sur une avocate qui est plus en mesure de trouver des personnes susceptibles de signer des déclarations solennelles, des affidavits, des rapports linguistiques, etc., ou qui est plus disposée à le faire, n'est pas un argument convaincant permettant de conclure que ces éléments de preuve auraient dû être admissibles devant l'agent d'ERAR. Cette conclusion permet de disposer de la demande.
[30]
J'ajouterais que le rapport Nurse a largement pour but de créer une diversion après qu'une conclusion relative à l'identité du demandeur a été tirée. En outre, le fait que ce rapport n'a été commandé qu'après que le demandeur a retenu les services de son avocate actuelle ne signifie pas qu'il s'agit d'un nouvel élément de preuve admissible en vertu de l'alinéa 113
a
) de la LIPR. Au contraire, comme la Cour l'a indiqué au paragraphe 16 de <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ce n'est pas la date de création du document qui détermine s'il est nouveau, mais le fait que l'on cherche à établir au moyen de celui-ci. Le rapport de Sprakab que le rapport Nurse a pour but de réfuter a été produit en 2007; c'est à l'audience devant la SPR que le rapport Nurse, ou un autre rapport semblable réfutant le rapport de Sprakab, aurait été admissible. À mon avis, la décision de rejeter le rapport Nurse était raisonnable. Après avoir examiné ce rapport, l'agent d'ERAR a conclu que le rapport de Sprakab était plus convaincant. L'agent d'ERAR pouvait raisonnablement parvenir à cette conclusion. En conséquence, si une preuve corroborante était nécessaire - ce qui n'était pas le cas -, elle aurait pu être tirée du rapport de Sprakab, car l'on pourrait raisonnablement considérer que celui-ci avait une plus grande valeur probante que le rapport Nurse.
[31]
Il reste à déterminer si des éléments de preuve produits par le demandeur qui n'étaient pas disponibles ou normalement accessibles lors de l'audience de la SPR, mais qu'ils l'étaient lors de la première demande d'ERAR, sont admissibles. J'estime que la décision de rejeter ces éléments de preuve était raisonnable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 41, la Cour d'appel fédérale a dit clairement que « la demande de protection visée à l'article 112 est une demande d'asile ». Un ERAR antérieur est visé à l'alinéa 113
a
), car il s'agit d'une demande d'asile et que « le demandeur d'asile [a été] débouté ». En fait, la Cour a appliqué l'alinéa 113
a
) de manière à limiter l'admissibilité des éléments de preuve produits dans le cadre des demandes d'ERAR subséquentes:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[32]
J'aborde maintenant la raisonnabilité générale de la décision de l'agent d'ERAR. À mon avis, cette décision était raisonnable au sens de la définition de la norme de la raisonnabilité établie dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité. Étant donné que le demandeur ne lui a pas présenté d'éléments de preuve admissibles susceptibles de remettre en question la décision de la SPR, l'agent d'ERAR n'a pas modifié la décision de la SPR concernant la crédibilité du demandeur. Ce dernier n'a tout simplement pas établi qu'il était un ressortissant somalien. En l'absence d'une preuve d'identité, les risques auxquels, selon le demandeur, il serait exposé s'il était renvoyé en Somalie ne sont pas pertinents aux fins de l'ERAR. Le demandeur ne peut, sans d'abord faire la preuve de son identité, établir une crainte fondée de persécution ou un risque faisant de lui une personne réputée protégée:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[33]
En plus de déterminer que le demandeur n'avait pas produit de nouveaux éléments de preuve admissibles, l'agent d'ERAR a effectué d'autres analyses concernant la valeur probante de l'information. Il a ainsi déterminé que les éléments de preuve, en supposant de façon tout à fait hypothétique qu'ils étaient admissibles, n'avaient qu'une faible valeur probante, voire aucune, aux fins de l'établissement de son identité. La Cour a examiné ces éléments de preuve afin de vérifier leur valeur probante. Comme elle l'a dit dans le passé, « [l] a retenue s'impose lorsque les agents d'ERAR évaluent la valeur probante de la preuve dont ils disposent »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Ferguson
]. Compte tenu de la déférence dont elle doit faire l'objet, la décision relative à l'ERAR appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Il incombait au demandeur d'établir, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la décision rendue par l'agent d'ERAR n'était pas raisonnable. Le demandeur ne peut s'acquitter de ce fardeau s'il ne présente pas des éléments de preuve probants. La décision de l'agent d'ERAR était raisonnable dans l'ensemble.
[34]
Enfin, le demandeur a prétendu devant la Cour que ses droits à l'équité procédurale avaient été violés parce que l'agent d'ERAR avait refusé de lui accorder une entrevue. La norme de contrôle applicable à la question de savoir si une décision a été prise dans le respect de l'équité procédurale est celle de la décision correcte:
Établissement de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 79.
[35]
Le demandeur soutient que, dans les faits, l'agent d'ERAR a contesté la crédibilité de sa preuve, ce qui lui donne droit à une audience. Or, il s'agit d'une interprétation erronée de la décision de l'agent d'ERAR. Celui-ci a simplement conclu que l'identité du demandeur n'avait pas été établie devant la SPR et que la preuve dont il disposait ne modifiait pas cette conclusion, que cette preuve soit admissible ou non. Comme je l'ai mentionné précédemment, un agent d'ERAR doit respecter les conclusions de la SPR, sauf s'il existe de nouveaux éléments admissibles qui auraient pu modifier la décision de celle-ci. Déterminer s'il y a suffisamment d'éléments de preuve admissibles pour établir l'identité du demandeur n'est pas en soi une question de crédibilité. Le fait de ne pas être convaincu par la preuve en raison de sa faible valeur probante est différent du fait de remettre en question la crédibilité d'un demandeur:
Ferguson
, au paragraphe 33. Il est bien établi qu'une audience ne peut être tenue relativement à une demande d'ERAR que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 41;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Or, le cas du demandeur n'est pas exceptionnel à cet égard et le devoir d'équité procédurale ne lui donne pas droit à une audience.
IV. Conclusion
[36]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. Les parties n'ont proposé aucune question grave de portée générale et l'affaire ne soulève aucune question à certifier.
JUGEMENT
[37]
LA COUR STATUE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. Il n'y a aucune question à certifier.

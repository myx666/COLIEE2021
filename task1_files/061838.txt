[1]
Strickland, J.
: This is an application brought pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (the IRPA) seeking judicial review of a decision of an immigration officer (the Officer) dated June 6, 2012. The Officer refused the Applicants' application for permanent residence which was based on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds pursuant to subsection 25(1) of the IRPA.
Background
[2]
The Applicants are citizens of Bangladesh. The principal Applicant is 56 years old, the minor Applicant is her 15 year old son. They entered Canada in 1999 when the minor Applicant was one year old and have remained here since that time.
[3]
The Applicants claimed refugee protection in the year of their arrival. In her Personal Information Form (PIF) the principal Applicant claimed to fear domestic violence which she had been subjected to by her husband in Bangladesh. The Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) heard the Applicants' claim and denied it in February of 2000.
[4]
In December of 2004, the Applicants requested that their application for permanent residence be considered on H&C grounds pursuant to subsection 25(1) of the IRPA. The basis of the request was the principal Applicant's fear of violence at the hands of her husband should she return to Bangladesh; their establishment in Canada; the hardship the son would suffer if they were forced to return to Bangladesh; and, the best interests of the minor Applicant. By decision dated June 6, 2012, the Officer denied the request. It is this decision which is the subject of the present judicial review (the Decision).
Decision Under Review
[5]
The Officer found that the factors to be considered in the Applicants' H&C application were hardship relating to the risk of harm upon return to Bangladesh; family or personal relationships that, if severed, would create hardship; the best interests of the child; degree of establishment in Canada; and, ties or residency in any other country.
[6]
The Officer reviewed the Applicants' 1999 refugee claim as well as their Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) application which was denied in July 2004. The Officer noted that the CRDD did not find the principal Applicant's claim as to her abusive spouse to be credible because her complaints to the police lacked detail and were made several years apart. She was also not credible because she is well educated and would have known of women's help groups or of legislation enacted for the purposes of protecting women. The Officer noted that the principal Applicant's credibility was also seriously harmed because the CRDD found she could have found assistance in Bangladesh, but chose not to seek such help. Furthermore, while she had the opportunity to stay away from her husband, she chose not to and this was indicative of her lack of subjective fear. The Officer noted that the principal Applicant cited the same risk to support the H&C application.
[7]
The Officer reviewed the evidence submitted by the principal Applicant in support of her fear of domestic violence but attributed little weight to this and found that the Applicants had not addressed the credibility issues raised. The Officer accepted the country condition information submitted by the Applicant with respect to the treatment of women in Bangladesh and noted that it established that much of the violence against women is predicated on the wealth or poverty of the women involved. The Officer noted that the principal Applicant is well educated and described herself in her PIF as "born and brought up in a respectable family". Therefore, it was reasonable to presume that the Applicant is from a wealthy family in Bangladesh and not similarly situated with the impoverished and vulnerable women depicted in much of her supporting documentation.
[8]
The Officer quoted portions of the country conditions information and while noting areas of concern, the documentation indicated that Bangladesh was making "serious efforts" to support women's rights. Ultimately, the Officer concluded that the evidence did not support that the Applicants would face risk or harm from the principal Applicant's husband or, if needed, that redress from such risk or harm could not be obtained. The Applicants did not face hardship relating to risk or harm that would constitute unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if they were required to return to Bangladesh.
[9]
As to establishment in Canada, the Officer noted that the principal Applicant was working in Canada without a valid work permit. As her reported income for 2008 to 2011 was between $16,200 and $18,600, it was reasonable to assume that her income was below the poverty line and, as such, was not necessarily indicative of establishment in Canada.
[10]
The Officer also considered the Applicants' community activities, family and friends in Canada. The Officer noted that the principal Applicant had not identified her cousin in Canada or provided a letter of support from her cousin. Although the Applicants had provided letters in support attesting to the Applicants' good character in support for their permanent resident claims, the Officer noted that the citizenship and immigration status of the authors of those letters was uncertain. The Officer stated that if the authors of those letters were in the same immigration position as the Applicants then this would impact the positive nature of their support.
[11]
The Officer concluded that the evidence did not support a finding that the Applicants have become established in Canada to the extent that severing their ties here would amount to unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
[12]
As to the best interests of the child, the Officer acknowledged the minor Applicant's involvement at school. The Officer noted that the minor Applicant does not speak Bengali but found "it is reasonable to assume that he has some grasp of the language, given his and his mother's involvement in the Bengali community in Canada". The Officer noted the unidentified cousin of the minor Applicant's mother and the letters of support provided by his close friends and others in the community. The Officer stated that there was no information to indicate that the minor Applicant has not maintained contact with his father or elder brother in Bangladesh, to support a finding that they pose a risk to him, or, that his extended family would be unable to support him during his re-integration.
[13]
The Officer referred to a report on country conditions and concluded that the principal Applicant's circumstances did not suggest that her son would be unable to access schools and healthcare, among other necessities, if he were to return to Bangladesh.
[14]
The Officer concluded by noting that the H&C process is not intended to eliminate all hardship. Rather, it is designed to provide relief from unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. The Applicants did not convince the Officer that their situation merits an exemption on the H&C grounds.
Issues
[15]
The Applicants submit that there are five issues in the present application which I have summarized as follows:
1. What is the standard of review?
2. Did the Officer err in the assessment of the best interests of the child?
3. Did the Officer err in the assessment of the hardship that the Applicants would face upon their removal to Bangladesh?
4. Did the Officer err in the assessment of the Applicant's establishment?
5. Did the Officer breach the principles of fairness by relying on extrinsic evidence without affording the Applicants an opportunity to respond?
[16]
Aside from the standard of review issue, which requires consideration in any judicial review application, I believe the issues may be more simply stated as follows:
1. Did the Officer breach the principles of procedural fairness?
2. Was the Officer's decision reasonable?
Standard of Review
[17]
A standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 57).
[18]
The standard of review for H&C decisions has been determined to be reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Reasonableness is concerned with the justification, transparency and intelligibility of the decision-making process, but also with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47).
[19]
The appropriate standard of review for issues of procedural fairness is correctness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 43;
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 11). No deference is owed to decision makers on these issues ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 50). The Court must determine whether the process followed by the decision-maker satisfied the level of fairness required in all of the circumstances. The Court may withhold relief if the error is purely technical and occasioned no substantial wrong ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 43;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )),
[20]
Prior case law has held that an officer's reliance on extrinsic evidence obtained on the internet without disclosing it to the applicant and providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond is a breach of procedural fairness and subject to the correctness standard of review (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 19;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
Positions of the Parties
[21]
The Applicants submit that the Officer erred in assessing the best interests of the child by ignoring evidence. The record contains a letter from the minor Applicant to the Officer that states, "I don't know any of my family in Bangladesh." Yet, in the Decision, the Officer states that there was no information "to indicate that the minor applicant had not maintained contact" with his family in Bangladesh and that his father, brother and grandparents, aunts and uncles in Bangladesh must be acknowledged as forming an integral part of his upbringing. Further, the Officer erred by failing to consider the impact that removal would have on the child and only considered whether the child would have basic amenities in Bangladesh, not what is in his best interests.
[22]
The Officer also erred in assessing the hardship that the Applicants would face upon their removal to Bangladesh. The Officer found that the principal Applicant was from a wealthy family in Bangladesh and, therefore, is not amongst the impoverished and vulnerable woman depicted as at risk in counsel's supporting documentation. Yet, conversely, the Officer finds that the principal Applicant is an impoverished woman in Canada. The Applicants submit that it is an error to find that their family would support them if they were in Bangladesh, while observing that it does not support them in Canada. Further, there was no evidence to support the Officer's assumption that the principal Applicant came from a wealthy family and that she would regain this wealth if she returned to Bangladesh.
[23]
The Applicants also argue that the Officer erred in considering their familial situation from which they came 13 years ago. The Officer should have considered the Applicant's current situation.
[24]
The Applicants submit that the Officer also erred in assessing their establishment in Canada. The Officer erred in doubting the status of the individuals who wrote letters of support on the Applicants' behalf. There was no reason to question whether the authors of the letters were Canadian permanent residents or Canadian citizens. Furthermore, their status should have no impact on the weight given to the letters. The Applicants also argue that it was unreasonable for the Officer to find that, because the Applicants have an income that is below the poverty line, they are not established in Canada. The Officer should have also considered as positive factors that the principal Applicant is a hard working single mother who has never received social assistance and pays her taxes yearly.
[25]
Regarding procedural fairness, the Applicants argue that the Officer considered and relied on extrinsic evidence without providing them with notice or an opportunity to respond to that evidence. In particular, the Officer considered documentation concerning the principal Applicant's university, her past employer, prior country conditions, and the filing of first information reports, none of which had been disclosed to the Applicants. The Officer therefore breached the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.
[26]
The Respondent submits that the Applicants are merely asking this Court to reweigh the evidence. The Officer provided cogent and comprehensive reasons for the Decision and made no reviewable errors.
[27]
With respect to the best interests of the child analysis, the Respondent submits that the Officer acknowledged the significant documentation submitted in support of the Applicants' application and specifically referred to the minor Applicant's submissions. Further, the Officer found that the child would have family in Bangladesh who would support his reintegration and there was no evidence to conclude that support would not be forthcoming. Further, while the minor Applicant's letter says that he does not know anyone in his family, this does not mean he does not have contact with them via telephone or correspondence. The Officer's Decision was reasonable in light of the fact that there was minimal evidence on the impact of the minor Applicant should he return to Bangladesh. The best interests of the child do not outweigh all other factors considered in an H&C application and the weight assigned to each factors is not to be re-examined by the Court.
[28]
The Respondent submits that the Officer's assessment of hardship was also reasonable. The Officer found that the Applicants would not face unusual, undeserved, or disproportionate hardship if they were removed to Bangladesh, particularly because they have family in Bangladesh who could assist them to reintegrate. The Officer also properly considered the Applicants' situation in Bangladesh prior to coming to Canada, as well as the Applicants' situation in Canada. The Respondent submits that the Officer did not make inconsistent findings.
[29]
The Officer also made no error with respect to the findings related to the Applicants' establishment in Canada. It was open to the Officer to afford little weight to the letters submitted in support of the Applicants' H&C application, the letters also did not demonstrate that the Applicants' removal would cause unusual, disproportionate or undeserved harm. It is not enough to establish that the Applicant is a welcome addition to Canadian society. The Officer weighed the positive and negative factors concerning establishment in Canada and reasonably found that they did not rise to the level of unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
[30]
Regarding the alleged breach of procedural fairness, the Respondent argues that none of the evidence referred to by the Applicants was extrinsic evidence.
Analysis
Procedural Fairness
[31]
The Applicants argue that the Officer's reliance on extrinsic evidence was a breach of procedural fairness. Specifically, evidence regarding the principal Applicant's university, past employer, country conditions in Bangladesh in or around 2000, and, the filing of First Information Reports in Bangladesh. The Applicant submits that the Officer relied on this information in making the hardship assessment.
[32]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) and stated, with respect to reliance on extrinsic evidence, "(t)he question is whether meaningful facts essential or potentially crucial to the decision had been used to support a decision without providing an opportunity to the affected party to respond to or comment upon these facts."
[33]
In the present case, the evidence that the Applicant argues was extrinsic is referred in the risk and adverse country conditions section of the Decision. This section primarily addresses hardship related to the principal Applicant's claim that if she returned to Bangladesh she would face risk or harm arising from domestic violence. In addressing this issue, the Officer acknowledged the information provided by the principal Applicant regarding the treatment of women in Bangladesh, but noted that much of the violence against women is largely predicted by the wealth or poverty of the women involved.
[34]
The Officer then noted that the principal Applicant's application indicated that she attended the University of Rajshahi from 1974 to 1980 and from 1986 to 1987 obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master's degree in geography and education. The Officer included extracts from the University's website and also remarked, based on another website, on the University's ranking within the top one hundred universities of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
[35]
The Officer continues:
The PA received a university education and two Master's degrees at a point in the history of Bangladesh when the country was facing considerate turmoil and poverty from the famine beginning in 1974 and flooding in 1998 according to an April 2000 assessment concluded by the United Kingdom Home Office. The PA was gainfully employed as a teacher at the Oxford International School in Dhaka, Oxford International School (OIS) is an English medium co-education School, which follows "
the academic programme of the University of Cambridge
" in the United Kingdom. The PA's PIF, which she signed in March 1999, indicates that the PA was residing in Dhaka prior to coming to Canada, and was "
born and brought up in a respectable family
" and she referred to the plight of women in Bangladesh as wishing to use her education to "
help this distressed part of society
". I note that she does not allude to herself in these particular comments. The information before me supports that it is reasonable to presume that the PA is from a wealthy family in Bangladesh and documentation has not been provided by the PA and her counsel to dispel this assumption. The PA indicates that her parents and siblings continue to reside in Bangladesh. As a result I do not find that the PA is similarly situated to the impoverishment and vulnerable women depicted in much of the applicant and her counsel's supporting documentation.
[36]
As stated by Justice Gagné in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the general rule to be distilled from the jurisprudence considering the use of information unilaterally obtained from the internet by a decision-maker is that when the information that is relied on contains novel and significant information that an applicant could not reasonably anticipate, then fairness dictates that the applicant should have the opportunity to challenge its relevance or validity (para 24).
[37]
In this case, the Officer obtained the information about the principal Applicant's university, its ranking and the school where she taught from websites. I do not agree with the Respondent that such materials are not extrinsic evidence merely because they are publicly available on the internet. Extrinsic evidence, in the context of an H&C decision, is evidence that does not form a part of the submissions of the Applicant nor of the immigration record of the Respondent concerning the Applicant and the disclosed tribunal record which includes online national documentation packages (NDP), addressed further below.
[38]
The internet provides instant access to a vast amount of information on any given subject, some of this information is accurate, and some of it is not. In my view, even if the information were not to be considered as extrinsic because it can be found on the internet, then there would also have to be some obvious connection to the information, and the use intended to be made of it by an officer, such that an applicant could reasonably expect that such information would be accessed and utilized in the context of the particular decision being made by the officer. That is not the situation in this case.
[39]
As to the Officer's reference to the 2000 U.K. Home Office assessment, Citizenship and Immigration Canada describes the information it holds in relation to country conditions on its website. NDPs are stated to be a compilation of publicly available documents that report on country conditions regularly reviewed and updated as country conditions change. The website also states that it is the responsibility of those participating in the refugee protection proceedings to review the documents contained in the NDP for their home country as the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may consider them when deciding a claim. Further, that the RPD may decide to use other documents as well, such as reports produced by the IRB Research Directorate, media articles etc, and that copies on any additional documents which the RDP finds useful will be sent to the parties before the hearing.
[40]
Thus, country conditions reports found within the NDPs are publicly available and an applicant is aware that an officer would refer to such reports for decision making purposes. However, in this case, it is not as clear that it was reasonable to expect the Applicants to know that the Officer would conduct research on country conditions in Bangladesh which prevailed twelve years earlier or the intended purpose for which that information was obtained. In any event, it was extrinsic evidence as it was not included in the current NDP and was not disclosed to the Applicants. Where an immigration officer relies on a document from a non-standard site, i.e. a site not regularly cited in the NDP, there is a duty to disclose novel and significant evidence which affects the decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[41]
As I have found that the information at issue was extrinsic, the question then becomes, did the Officer rely upon it to reach the Decision without providing the Applicant with an opportunity to respond?
[42]
In this situation the Officer interpreted the country condition information submitted by the Applicants as being such that violence against women in Bangladesh is largely predicted by the wealth or poverty of the women involved, wealthy women apparently being less at risk. Evidence of the principal Applicant's wealth would support the Officer's determination that the Applicant was largely not at risk of harm in this regard.
[43]
The Officer reviewed the website of the university that the principal Applicant attended, another website pertaining to the university's ranking, Bangladesh country conditions prevailing at the time of her university attendance and the website of the school where she taught in Bangladesh concluded that the Applicant was not at a risk of hardship arising from domestic violence as she must be from a wealthy family. The basis of this conclusion was that the Applicant attended a high ranking university and could afford to do so during a time when Bangladesh was suffering from the effects of famine then flooding. The Officer clearly relied on this extrinsic evidence because in referring to it and the extracts from the principal Applicant's PIF the Officer stated "The information before me supports that it is reasonable to presume that the Applicant is from a wealthy family in Bangladesh and documentation has not been provided by the PA and her counsel to dispel this assumption".
[44]
Not only did the Officer rely on extrinsic evidence to reach a conclusion as to the principal Applicant's family's wealth, the Officer then went on to state that the Applicant did not provide evidence to dispel that assumption. In my view, it was a breach of procedural fairness to obtain and rely on extrinsic evidence for the purpose of supporting an inference that had not been put to the Applicants and then to fault them for not having responded to that inference. It was also unreasonable to expect the principal Applicant to anticipate that the inferred wealth of her family twelve years ago would form the basis of the Officer's finding that she would personally be unlikely to be at a risk of hardship due to domestic violence if she returned to Bangladesh. This is particularly so as the Officer also noted in the establishment portion of the Decision that the Applicant's income tax returns for 2008-2011 were between $16,200 and $18,600 and that "as a worker without other discernable means of support it is reasonable to presume that the PA's yearly income is below Canadian poverty figures and as such is not necessarily indicative of establishment in Canada".
[45]
It should also be noted that the Officer's interpretation of the country conditions submitted by the Applicant is suspect. For example, the 2005 article entitled "Violence against women: a statistical overview, challenges and gaps in data collection and methodology and approaches form overcoming them," prepared by the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association states that, "Women of all economic strata are vulnerable to maltreatment and abuse by husbands, in-laws and other family members." Furthermore, the August 1, 2006, Responses to Information Requests BGD101506.E states, "Domestic abuse reportedly affects women in Bangladesh from different income groups." The Officer also quotes the US Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Bangladesh in 2010 which states that, "There are no adequate support groups for victims of domestic violence."
[46]
The Officer stated that information and evidence presented by the Applicants as well as publicly available documentation did not support a finding that the Applicants faced a direct personal hardship relating to risk or harm from the principal Applicant's husband. The Officer should have put the extrinsic evidence used to reach an inference that may have been material to the outcome of the H&C application, to the Applicants for their response. Therefore, I find that there was a breach of procedural fairness and for that reason the Decision must be quashed.
[47]
Given that the issue of procedural fairness is depositive of this matter, it is unnecessary for me to proceed further. However, because I am of the view that the Officer's determination that the minor Applicant would not suffer any unusual, underserved or disproportionate hardship if he were to be removed to Bangladesh was unreasonable, I will also briefly address that issue.
Best Interests of the Child
[48]
Justice Décary of the Federal Court of Appeal wrote that "[...] the concept of 'undeserved hardship' is ill-suited when assessing the hardship on innocent children. Children will rarely, if ever, be deserving of any hardship" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 75, the Supreme Court of Canada stated the following about the analysis of the best interests of the child:
[75] [...] for the exercise of the discretion to fall within the standard of reasonableness, the decision-maker should consider children's best interests as an important factor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them. That is not to say that children's best interests must always outweigh other considerations, or that there will not be other reasons for denying an H & C claim even when children's interests are given this consideration. However, where the interests of children are minimized, in a manner inconsistent with Canada's humanitarian and compassionate tradition and the Minister's guidelines, the decision will be unreasonable.
[50]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Campbell expanded on the Supreme Court's terminology of "alert, alive, and sensitive":
[9] The word alert implies awareness. When an H&C application indicates that a child that will be directly affected by the decision, a visa officer must demonstrate an awareness of the child's best interests by noting the ways in which those interests are implicated [...]
[...]
[11] [...] in order to be alive to a child's best interests, it is necessary for a visa officer to demonstrate that he or she well understands the perspective of each of the participants in a given fact scenario, including the child if this can reasonably determined.
[12] [...] To demonstrate sensitivity, the officer must be able to clearly articulate the suffering of a child that will result from a negative decision, and then say whether, together with a consideration of other factors, the suffering warrants humanitarian and compassionate relief.
[51]
The Applicants submit that the Officer erred by ignoring the evidence that was on the record. I agree with the Applicants and find the Officer minimized the best interests of the child.
[52]
I acknowledge that decision-makers are presumed to have considered all of the evidence before them. Therefore, they are not required to make specific reference to every piece of evidence in the record. Failure to analyse evidence that contradicts a tribunal's decision will be found to be unreasonable only when the evidence that is overlooked is critical, contradicts the tribunal's conclusion and ultimately the reviewing Court finds that the omission indicates the tribunal's unwillingness to consider the materials before it (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). However, "the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact "without regard to the evidence"" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (TD) at para 17).
[53]
The certified tribunal record contains a letter from the minor Applicant which was before the Officer. It states, in part:
[...] I want to stay in Canada because I understand English very well and I don't know how to speak or write in the language of Bangladesh. I want to see my friends and family all the time and I want a good future in Canada. I don't know anyone of my family in Bangladesh.
[54]
The Officer's finding that the Applicants would not face unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship upon their return to Bangladesh largely rests on the finding that the Applicants would receive support from their family in Bangladesh. It appears that this latter finding was made without regard to the evidence that the minor Applicant presented to the Officer.
[55]
At page 10-11 of the Decision, the Officer wrote:
I note that submissions also indicate that the PA's son speaks both English and French, and does not speak Bengali as his mother does; although it is reasonable to assume that he has some grasp of the language, given his mother's involvement in the Bengali community in Canada.
[...]
Information has not been provided to indicate that the child has not maintained contact with his father or elder brother in Bangladesh or to support that they pose any risk whatsoever to the child. I further note that documentation has not been provided to support that the PA's family in Bangladesh, including the child's grand-parents, aunts, uncles, and their families in Bangladesh would not be available for support in his re-integration to Bangladesh society.
[56]
And at page 15:
The child's father, only brother, grand parents, and all his aunts and uncles reside in Bangladesh and they must be acknowledged as also forming an integral part of the child's upbringing.
[57]
The Officer states that no evidence was provided showing that the minor Applicant did not maintain contact with his father or elder brother in Bangladesh. Yet, the minor Applicant wrote to the Officer to say, "I don't know anyone of my family in Bangladesh." While in the best interest of the child analysis the Officer states that the minor Applicant's father and brother reside in Bangladesh and must be considered to form an integral part of his upbringing, the minor Applicant has not been in Bangladesh since he was one year old. In fact, in the risk and adverse country conditions of the Decision, the Officer stated that the principal Applicant had not provided information to support that her husband or her elder son continue to reside in Bangladesh.
[58]
Furthermore, the Officer assumed that the child has some grasp of the Bengali language, yet the child indicated he does not speak or write that language.
[59]
From this it can be concluded that the Officer failed to give due consideration to the minor Applicant's letter and misapprehended the involvement and support available from his extended family in Bangladesh.
[60]
The Respondent distinguishes <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, from the present application. I agree that the facts can distinguish that case from the facts underlying this application. However, the general principle from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> survives. The Court must ask whether the Officer was "alert, alive, and sensitive" to the best interests of the child. I am not convinced that the Officer was in this case.
[61]
Other than stating that the minor Applicant is 15 years old, is in grade nine, on the honour roll of his school and acknowledging letters of support from the child's close friends and others in the community, the Officer does not state the ways in which the best interests of the minor Applicant would be impacted by a return to Bangladesh.
[62]
Further, the Officer states, "As previously indicated, the circumstances of the PA do not suggest that her child would be of such a profile in Bangladesh that he would not be able to access schools and healthcare, among other necessities if he were to return to Bangladesh." This presumably is a reference to the Officer's assumption, which was based in part on the extrinsic evidence, that the principal Applicant comes from a wealthy family. It ignores the fact that in Canada, the principal Applicant's reported income is below the poverty line. It appears to assume that the principal Applicant's family remains wealthy and will support both her and her son. While that may be the case, I cannot accept that these are well founded assumptions based on the evidence.
[63]
The Officer also states, "The documentation before me does not support that the child's basic amenities such as education and health care would not be available to him in Bangladesh". The test, of course, is not whether the basic amenities would be available to the child in Bangladesh, rather, it is what is in the child's best interests. The Officer's analysis was insufficient given that the minor Applicant has been in Canada since he was one year old and stated that he does not know his relatives in Bangladesh or speak the language.
Conclusion
[64]
The application for judicial review is allowed and the decision is remitted back for re-determination before a different officer(s) at Citizenship and Immigration Canada. No question of general importance for certification has been proposed and none arises.
JUDGMENT
[65]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is allowed and the decision is remitted back for re-determination before a different officer at Citizenship and Immigration Canada. No question of general importance for certification has been proposed and none arises.

Sultana Narniger  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, L.C. 2001, ch. 27 (LIPR) visant la décision rendue par un agent d'immigration (l'agent) le 6 juin 2012. Celui-ci a refusé la demande de résidence permanente des demandeurs, qui était fondée sur des considérations d'ordre humanitaire (la demande CH) au titre du paragraphe 25(1) de la LIPR.
Contexte
[2]
Les demandeurs sont citoyens du Bangladesh. La demanderesse principale a 56 ans, le demandeur mineur est son fils de 15 ans. Ils sont entrés au Canada en 1999 alors que le demandeur mineur avait un an et ils y sont demeurés depuis.
[3]
Les demandeurs ont demandé l'asile l'année de leur arrivée. Dans son formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP), la demanderesse principale a affirmé craindre la violence conjugale que son époux lui avait fait subir au Bangladesh. La Section du statut de réfugié (SSR) a examiné la demande d'asile et l'a rejetée en 2000.
[4]
En décembre 2004, les demandeurs ont sollicité l'examen de leur demande de résidence permanent pour des considérations d'ordre humanitaire au titre du paragraphe 25(1) de la LIPR. La demande était fondée sur la crainte de la demanderesse principale d'être victime d'actes de violence commis par son mari si elle devait retourner au Bangladesh, l'établissement au Canada des demandeurs, les difficultés que subirait le fils s'ils étaient obligés de retourner au Bangladesh et l'intérêt supérieur du demandeur mineur. Dans une décision datée du 6 juin 2012, l'agent a rejeté la demande. C'est cette décision (la décision) qui fait l'objet du présent contrôle judiciaire.

L'agent a conclu que les facteurs à prendre en considération dans la demande CH des demandeurs étaient les difficultés découlant du risque de préjudice à leur retour au Bangladesh, les liens familiaux ou personnels qui, s'ils étaient rompus, causeraient des difficultés, l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, le degré d'établissement au Canada et les liens ou la résidence dans tout autre pays.
[6]
L'agent a pris connaissance de la demande d'asile présentée par les demandeurs en 1999 ainsi que de leur demande d'examen des risques avant renvoi (ERAR), qui avait été rejetée en juillet 2004. Il a pris note que la SSR n'avait pas jugé crédible les allégations de la demanderesse principale concernant son époux violent parce que ses plaintes à la police manquaient de détails et avaient été formulées à plusieurs années d'intervalle. Elle avait également été jugée non crédible parce qu'elle était bien éduquée et aurait dû connaître l'existence de groupes d'aide aux femmes ou de textes législatifs édictés dans le but de protéger les femmes. L'agent a mentionné avoir de sérieux doutes quant à la crédibilité de la demanderesse principale parce que la SSR avait conclu qu'elle aurait pu demander de l'aide au Bangladesh, mais n'avait pas sollicité cette aide. En outre, bien qu'elle ait eu la possibilité de quitter son mari, elle a choisi de ne pas le faire, ce qui démontre une absence de crainte subjective de sa part. L'agent a également fait remarquer que la demanderesse principale invoquait le même risque à l'appui de sa demande CH.
[7]
L'agent a examiné la preuve produite par la demanderesse principale à l'appui de sa crainte de violence conjugale, mais lui a accordé peu d'importance et a estimé que les demandeurs n'avaient pas répondu aux doutes soulevés quant à leur crédibilité. L'agent a admis des renseignements sur la situation du pays soumis par la demanderesse au sujet du traitement des femmes au Bangladesh et a remarqué que cette preuve indiquait que, dans une large mesure, la violence faite aux femmes dépendait de la richesse ou de la pauvreté de la femme concernée. Il a observé que la demanderesse principale était bien éduquée et se décrivait dans son FRP comme étant [traduction] « née et [ayant été] élevée dans une famille respectable ». Par conséquent, il a estimé raisonnable de présumer que la demanderesse provenait d'une famille riche au Bangladesh et ne se trouvait pas dans une situation semblable à celle des femmes pauvres et vulnérables dont il était question dans la plupart des documents fournis par la demanderesse principale.
[8]
L'agent a cité des passages des renseignements sur la situation du pays et, tout en relevant certains éléments préoccupants, a conclu que, selon la documentation, le Bangladesh faisait des [traduction] « efforts sérieux » pour défendre les droits des femmes. En fin de compte, l'agent a conclu que la preuve ne montrait pas que les demandeurs seraient exposés à un risque ou subiraient un préjudice en raison de l'époux de la demanderesse principale ou, si cela s'avérait, qu'il n'existait aucune protection contre ce risque ou ce préjudice. S'ils devaient retourner au Bangladesh, les demandeurs ne seraient pas exposés, de par ce risque ou ce préjudice, à des difficultés pouvant être qualifiées d'inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives.
[9]
Quant à l'établissement au Canada, l'agent a fait remarquer que la demanderesse principale travaillait au Canada sans permis de travail valide. Étant donné que son revenu déclaré pour les années 2008 à 2011 se situait entre 16 200 $ et 18 600 $, il était raisonnable de présumer que son revenu se situait sous le seuil de la pauvreté et, par conséquent, qu'il n'était pas une preuve d'établissement au Canada.
[10]
L'agent a également pris en considération les activités communautaires des demandeurs, leur famille et leurs amis au Canada. Il a fait observer que la demanderesse principale n'avait pas divulgué l'identité de son cousin au Canada ni produit de lettre de soutien de ce cousin. Bien que les demandeurs aient présenté des lettres de soutien attestant de leur bonne moralité à l'appui de leur demande de résidence permanente, l'agent a souligné que la citoyenneté ou le statut d'immigrant des auteurs de ces lettres étaient incertains. Il a affirmé que si les auteurs de ces lettres se trouvaient, sur le plan de l'immigration, dans la même situation que les demandeurs, cela pourrait avoir une incidence sur la nature favorable de leur appui.
[11]
L'agent a estimé que la preuve ne permettait pas de conclure que les demandeurs s'étaient établis au Canada au point où la rupture de leurs liens avec le pays causerait des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives.
[12]
En ce qui concerne l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, l'agent a reconnu l'engagement du demandeur mineur à l'école. Il a pris note que celui-ci ne parlait pas le bengali, mais a estimé [traduction] « qu'il est raisonnable de présumer qu'il connaît les rudiments de la langue, étant donné son engagement et celui de sa mère auprès de la communauté bengalaise au Canada ». L'agent a mentionné le cousin non identifié de la mère du demandeur mineur ainsi que les lettres d'appui fournies par ses amis proches et d'autres personnes de la communauté. Il a affirmé qu'aucun élément de preuve ne laissait croire que le demandeur mineur n'était pas demeuré en communication avec son père ou son frère aîné au Bangladesh, que ceux-ci pouvaient représenter une menace pour lui ou que sa famille élargie serait incapable de le soutenir durant sa réintégration.
[13]
L'agent a fait référence à un rapport sur la situation du pays pour conclure que les circonstances propres à la demanderesse principale ne laissaient pas entendre que son fils ne pourrait pas avoir accès à des écoles et à des soins de santé, entre autres nécessités, s'il devait retourner au Bangladesh.
[14]
L'agent a terminé en soulignant que le processus des demandes CH n'avait pas pour but d'éliminer toutes les difficultés, mais visait plutôt à offrir un recours contre les difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives. Les demandeurs n'ont pas convaincu l'agent que leur situation méritait une exemption pour considérations d'ordre humanitaire.
Questions
[15]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire repose sur cinq questions, que je résume ainsi:
1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle?
2. L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur dans son évaluation de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant?
3. L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur dans son évaluation des difficultés auxquelles les demandeurs auraient à faire face s'ils étaient renvoyés au Bangladesh?
4. L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur dans son évaluation de l'établissement des demandeurs?
5. L'agent a-t-il manqué aux principes d'équité en s'appuyant sur des éléments de preuve extrinsèques sans donner la chance aux demandeurs d'y répondre?
[16]
Hormis la question de la norme de contrôle, qui doit être examinée dans toute demande de contrôle judiciaire, j'estime que les questions peuvent être énoncées plus simplement de la façon suivante:
1. L'agent a-t-il manqué aux principes d'équité procédurale?
2. La décision de l'agent était-elle raisonnable?
La norme de contrôle
[17]
Il n'est pas nécessaire dans tous les cas de procéder à une analyse de la norme de contrôle. En fait, lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable à la question dont est saisie la cour est bien établie par la jurisprudence, la cour de révision peut adopter cette norme de contrôle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], paragraphe 57).
[18]
Il a été établi que la norme de contrôle applicable aux décisions visant des demandes CH est la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 31;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 5;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 18). Le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, mais également à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, paragraphe 47).
[19]
La norme de contrôle applicable aux questions d'équité procédurale est la décision correcte (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], paragraphe 43;
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 22;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], paragraphe 11). La cour de révision n'acquiesce pas au raisonnement du décideur pour ce qui est de ces questions (Dunsmuir, précité, paragraphe 50). La Cour doit déterminer si le processus suivi par le décideur satisfait au degré d'équité requis dans toutes les circonstances. Elle peut s'abstenir d'accorder réparation si l'erreur procédurale est un vice de forme et n'entraîne aucun dommage important ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, paragraphe 43;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 16;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 11).
[20]
La jurisprudence a établi que le fait pour un agent de s'appuyer sur des éléments de preuve extrinsèques tirés d'Internet sans les divulguer au demandeur ni lui donner la chance d'y répondre constitue un manquement à l'équité procédurale et est assujetti à la norme de contrôle de la décision correcte (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], paragraphe 19;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  parties
[21]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agent a commis une erreur dans son évaluation de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant en ne tenant pas compte de certains éléments de preuve. Le dossier contient une lettre du demandeur mineur adressée à l'agent, dans laquelle il est écrit: [traduction] « Je ne connais personne de ma famille au Bangladesh. » Pourtant, dans sa décision, l'agent affirme qu'aucun renseignement ne laisse croire [traduction] « que le demandeur mineur n'est pas demeuré en communication » avec sa famille au Bangladesh et que son père, son frère, ses grands-parents, ses tantes et ses oncles au Bangladesh doivent être considérés comme faisant partie intégrante de son éducation. En outre, l'agent aurait commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte des répercussions qu'aurait le renvoi sur l'enfant et en se demandant seulement si celui-ci aurait accès aux services de base au Bangladesh, sans prendre en considération son intérêt supérieur.
[22]
L'agent aurait également commis une erreur dans son évaluation des difficultés auxquelles les demandeurs auraient à faire face s'ils étaient renvoyés au Bangladesh. L'agent a conclu que la demanderesse principale provenait d'une famille riche au Bangladesh et que, par conséquent, elle n'était pas l'une des femmes pauvres et vulnérables décrites dans les documents d'information produits par l'avocat. Pourtant, l'agent a conclu que la demanderesse principale était une femme pauvre au Canada. Les demandeurs soutiennent qu'il s'agit d'une erreur que de conclure que leur famille les soutiendrait s'ils étaient au Bangladesh tout en observant qu'elle ne les soutient pas au Canada. De plus, aucune preuve n'étaierait l'hypothèse de l'agent selon laquelle la demanderesse provient d'une famille riche et qu'elle pourrait à nouveau bénéficier de cette richesse à son retour au Bangladesh.
[23]
Les demandeurs prétendent aussi que l'agent a commis une erreur en prenant en considération leur situation familiale telle qu'elle était il y a 13 ans. L'agent aurait dû prendre en considération la situation actuelle de la demanderesse.
[24]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agent a aussi commis une erreur dans son évaluation de leur établissement au Canada. Il aurait commis une erreur en mettant en doute le statut des personnes ayant écrit les lettres d'appui aux demandeurs. Il n'y avait aucune raison de se demander si les auteurs des lettres étaient des résidents permanents ou des citoyens canadiens. En outre, leur statut n'aurait dû avoir aucune incidence sur la valeur accordée aux lettres. Les demandeurs soutiennent également qu'il était déraisonnable pour l'agent de conclure que, parce que leur revenu se situait sous le seuil de la pauvreté, ils n'étaient pas établis au Canada. L'agent aurait également dû considérer comme un facteur positif le fait que la demanderesse principale est une mère célibataire qui travaille fort, qui n'a jamais reçu d'aide sociale et qui paye ses impôts tous les ans.
[25]
En ce qui concerne l'équité procédurale, les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agent a pris en considération des éléments de preuve extrinsèques et s'est appuyé sur ceux-ci sans en aviser les demandeurs ou leur donner la chance d'y répondre. En particulier, l'agent aurait tenu compte de documents concernant l'université de la demanderesse principale, son ancien employeur, la situation antérieure du pays et le dépôt de Premiers rapports d'information, sans communiquer aucun de ces documents aux demandeurs. L'agent aurait par conséquent manqué aux principes de justice naturelle et d'équité procédurale.
[26]
Le défendeur soutient que les demandeurs essaient tout simplement de faire réexaminer la preuve par la Cour. L'agent aurait fourni des motifs convaincants et détaillés à l'appui de sa décision et n'aurait commis aucune erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[27]
En ce qui a trait à l'analyse de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, le défendeur soutient que l'agent a tenu compte de la documentation importante produite à l'appui de la demande des demandeurs et a en particulier fait référence aux observations du demandeur mineur. En outre, l'agent a conclu qu'il aurait une famille pour soutenir sa réintégration au Bangladesh et rien ne permettait de conclure que la famille ne donnerait pas cet appui. De plus, bien que le demandeur mineur précise dans sa lettre qu'il ne connaît personne de sa famille, cela ne signifie pas qu'il n'est pas en communication avec elle par téléphone ou par courrier. Ainsi, la décision de l'agent était raisonnable compte tenu de la preuve très mince quant aux répercussions qu'aurait sur le demandeur mineur son retour au Bangladesh. L'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant ne l'emporte pas sur tous les autres facteurs pris en considération dans le cadre d'une demande CH et la valeur attribuée à chacun des facteurs ne peut être réexaminée par la Cour.
[28]
Le défendeur soutient que l'évaluation par l'agent des difficultés était également raisonnable. L'agent a conclu que les demandeurs n'auraient pas à faire face à des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives s'ils étaient renvoyés au Bangladesh, en particulier parce qu'ils y ont de la famille qui pourrait aider à leur réintégration. L'agent a également dûment pris en considération la situation des demandeurs au Bangladesh avant leur arrivée au Canada, ainsi que la situation des demandeurs au Canada. Le défendeur fait valoir que l'agent n'a pas tiré de conclusions contradictoires.
[29]
L'agent n'aurait pas non plus commis d'erreur dans ses conclusions quant à l'établissement des demandeurs au Canada. Il était loisible à l'agent d'accorder peu de valeur aux lettres produites à l'appui de la demande CH des demandeurs. Ces lettres ne montraient d'ailleurs pas que le renvoi des demandeurs causerait un préjudice inhabituel, injustifié ou excessif. Il ne suffit pas d'établir que les demandeurs s'intégreraient avec succès à la société canadienne. L'agent a pris en considération les facteurs favorables et les facteurs défavorables concernant l'établissement au Canada et a tiré la conclusion raisonnable que leur renvoi ne causerait pas de difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives.
[30]
Pour ce qui est du prétendu manquement à l'équité procédurale, le défendeur soutient qu'aucun des éléments de preuve mentionnés par les demandeurs n'était une preuve extrinsèque.
Analyse
Équité procédurale
[31]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agent a manqué à l'équité procédurale en s'appuyant sur des éléments de preuve extrinsèques, soit des éléments de preuve concernant l'université de la demanderesse principale, son ancien employeur, la situation au Bangladesh vers l'année 2000 et le dépôt de Premiers rapports d'information. Les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agent s'est fondé sur ces renseignements dans son évaluation des difficultés.
[32]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.) et a déclaré, au sujet du recours aux éléments de preuve extrinsèques, que « (l)a question est de savoir si des faits concrets, essentiels ou potentiellement cruciaux pour la décision ont été utilisés à l'appui d'une décision, sans que la partie visée ait eu la possibilité de répondre à ces faits ou de les commenter ».
[33]
En l'espèce, les éléments de preuve qui seraient, selon les demandeurs, extrinsèques sont mentionnés dans la partie de la décision traitant des risques et des conditions défavorables dans le pays. Il est surtout question dans cette partie de la décision des difficultés liées à l'allégation de la demanderesse principale selon laquelle elle pourrait être exposée à des risques ou subir un préjudice en raison d'actes de violence conjugale si elle devait retourner au Bangladesh. À ce sujet, l'agent a admis les renseignements fournis par la demanderesse principale concernant le traitement des femmes au Bangladesh, mais a fait observer que, dans une large mesure, la violence contre les femmes dépend de la richesse ou de la pauvreté de la femme concernée.
[34]
L'agent a ensuite fait remarquer qu'il était précisé dans la demande de la demanderesse principale qu'elle avait fréquenté l'Université de Rajshahi de 1974 à 1980, puis en 1986 et 1987, et y avait obtenu un baccalauréat ès arts et une maîtrise en géographie et en enseignement. L'agent a inclus des extraits du site Web de l'université et a souligné que, selon un autre site Web, l'université se classait parmi les cent meilleures universités de l'Inde, du Pakistan, du Sri Lanka et du Bangladesh.
[35]
L'agent poursuit:
[traduction] La DP a suivi des cours à l'université et a obtenu deux maîtrises à un moment de l'histoire du Bangladesh où le pays était aux prises avec des turbulences et une pauvreté considérables en raison de la famine qui a commencé en 1974 et des inondations de 1998, selon une évaluation d'avril 2000 faite par le Home Office du Royaume-Uni. La DP occupait un poste rémunéré de professeur à l'Oxford International School (OIS) à Dhaka. Il s'agit d'une école de langue anglaise mixte, qui suit «
le programme académique de l'Université de Cambridge
» au Royaume-Uni. Il est indiqué dans le FRP de la DP, qu'elle a signé en mars 1999, qu'elle résidait à Dhaka avant sa venue au Canada et qu'elle «
était née et avait été élevée dans une famille respectable
». Elle y mentionnait la situation difficile des femmes au Bangladesh et disait vouloir utiliser son éducation pour «
aider cette partie affligée de la société
». Je remarque qu'elle ne faisait pas allusion à elle-même dans cette observation. Les renseignements dont je dispose indiquent qu'il est raisonnable de présumer que la DP provient d'une famille riche au Bangladesh et aucun document n'a été produit par la DP ou son avocat permettant de réfuter cette présomption. La DP précise que ses parents ainsi que ses frères et sœurs demeurent encore au Bangladesh. Par conséquent, j'estime que la DP ne se trouve pas dans une situation semblable à celle des femmes pauvres et vulnérables dont il est question dans la plupart des documents à l'appui produits par la demanderesse et son avocat.
[36]
Comme l'a affirmé la juge Gagné dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, selon la règle générale ressortant de la jurisprudence au sujet de l'utilisation de renseignements obtenus unilatéralement d'Internet par un décideur, lorsque les renseignements utilisés comportent de l'information inédite et importante que le demandeur ne pouvait pas raisonnablement prévoir, l'équité exige que le demandeur ait la chance de mettre en doute sa pertinence ou sa validité (paragraphe 24).
[37]
En l'espèce, l'agent a tiré de sites Web des renseignements au sujet de l'université de la demanderesse principale, de son classement et de l'école où elle a enseigné. Je ne peux être d'accord avec le défendeur et conclure que ces renseignements ne constituent pas des éléments de preuve extrinsèque uniquement parce qu'ils sont affichés publiquement sur Internet. La preuve extrinsèques, dans le cadre d'une décision visant une demande CH, est une preuve qui ne fait partie ni des observations du demandeur ni du dossier d'immigration du défendeur concernant le demandeur ou du dossier communiqué du tribunal, qui inclut les cartables nationaux de documentation (CND) disponibles en ligne, dont il sera plus tard question.
[38]
L'Internet donne accès instantanément à une vaste quantité de renseignements sur n'importe quel sujet. Certains sont exacts, d'autres non. À mon avis, même si les renseignements n'étaient pas considérés comme étant extrinsèques parce qu'ils se trouvent sur Internet, il faudrait aussi qu'il y ait un lien évident avec eux, et avec l'utilisation que l'agent entend en faire, au point où le demandeur pourrait raisonnablement s'attendre à ce qu'ils soient consultés et utilisés dans le contexte de la décision précise que l'agent doit prendre. Ce n'est pas le cas dans la présente affaire.
[39]
Pour ce qui est de la mention par l'agent d'une évaluation effectuée en 2000 par le Home Office du Royaume-Uni, Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada précise sur son site Web les renseignements qu'il possède à l'égard de la situation d'un pays. Les CND sont censés être une compilation des documents accessibles au public qui font rapport de la situation dans le pays et sont censés être régulièrement révisés et mis à jour afin de refléter les changements dans la situation du pays. Le site Web précise également qu'il incombe aux personnes participant aux procédures de protection des réfugiés de réviser les documents contenus dans le CND de leur pays d'origine étant donné que la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) peut les prendre en considération dans sa décision. En outre, il est mentionné que la SPR peut se servir d'autres documents, comme les rapports produits par la Direction des recherches de la CISR, des articles des médias, etc., et que des copies de tout document supplémentaire que la SPR juge utile seront envoyées aux parties avant l'audience.
[40]
Par conséquent, les rapports sur la situation du pays figurant dans les CND sont accessibles au public et le demandeur sait que l'agent consultera ces rapports pour prendre sa décision. Cependant, en l'espèce, il n'est pas clair qu'il était raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que les demandeurs sachent que l'agent effectuerait des recherche sur la situation au Bangladesh il y a douze ans ou dans quel but ces renseignements étaient obtenus. De toute façon, il s'agissait d'une preuve extrinsèque, car elle ne faisait pas partie du CND le plus récent et n'avait pas été communiquée aux demandeurs. Dans le cas où l'agent d'immigration s'appuie sur un document tiré d'un site Web non courant, c'est-à-dire un site qui n'est pas régulièrement mentionné dans les CND, il existe une obligation de divulguer les éléments de preuve inédits et importants qui ont une incidence sur la décision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 15).
[41]
Puisque j'ai conclu que les renseignements en question étaient extrinsèques, la question devient la suivante: l'agent s'est-il appuyé sur ces renseignements afin de prendre sa décision, sans donner à la demanderesse la chance d'y répondre?
[42]
Dans le cas présent, l'agent a conclu des renseignements sur la situation du pays soumis par les demandeurs que la violence envers les femmes au Bangladesh dépendait dans une large mesure de la richesse ou de la pauvreté de la femme concernée, les femmes riches étant apparemment moins susceptibles d'être visées. Des éléments de preuve démontrant la richesse de la demanderesse principale étayeraient la conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle elle serait peu susceptible d'être victime d'un préjudice à cet égard.
[43]
L'agent a examiné le site Web de l'université qu'a fréquentée la demanderesse principale, un autre site Web concernant le classement de l'université, un site sur la situation au Bangladesh à l'époque où la demanderesse y était étudiante ainsi que le site Web de l'école où elle enseignait au Bangladesh afin de conclure que la demanderesse ne risquait pas de subir des difficultés liées à la violence conjugale étant donné qu'elle devait provenir d'une famille riche. Cette conclusion était fondée sur le fait que la demanderesse a fréquenté une bonne université et a pu le faire à une époque où le Bangladesh souffrait des effets d'une famine et d'inondations. L'agent s'est clairement appuyés sur cette preuve extrinsèque parce qu'il y a fait référence, ainsi qu'à des passages du FRP de la demanderesse, lorsqu'il a affirmé ceci: [traduction] « Les renseignements dont je dispose indiquent qu'il est raisonnable de présumer que la DP provient d'une famille riche au Bangladesh et aucun document n'a été produit par la DP ou son avocat permettant de réfuter cette présomption. »
[44]
Non seulement l'agent s'est appuyé sur des éléments de preuve extrinsèques afin de présumer de la richesse de la famille de la demanderesse principale, mais encore il a affirmé que celle-ci n'avait pas fourni de preuve réfutant cette présomption. À mon sens, il s'agit d'un manquement à l'équité procédurale que d'obtenir et d'utiliser une preuve extrinsèque afin d'étayer une inférence qui n'a pas été communiquée aux demandeurs et d'ensuite leur reprocher de ne pas y avoir répondu. Il était déraisonnable de s'attendre à ce que la demanderesse principale prévoit que la richesse présumée de sa famille il y a douze ans servirait de fondement à la conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle elle ne risquait pas personnellement de subir des difficultés liées à la violence conjugale si elle devait retourner au Bangladesh. Cela est d'autant plus vrai que l'agent a également remarqué dans la partie de la décision sur l'établissement au Canada que le revenu déclaré de la demanderesse de 2008 à 2011 se situait entre 16 200 $ et 18 600 $ et que [traduction] « en tant que travailleuse sans autre soutien perceptible, il est raisonnable de présumer que le revenu de la DP se situe sous le seuil de la pauvreté et qu'il ne représente donc pas nécessairement une preuve d'établissement au Canada ».
[45]
Il faut également observer que l'interprétation faite par l'agent de la situation du pays en fonction des documents soumis par la demanderesse est douteuse. Par exemple, il est écrit dans l'article de 2005 intitulé
Violence against women: a statistical overview, challenges and gaps in data collection and methodology and approaches for overcoming them
, rédigé par la Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association: [traduction] « Des femmes de toutes les classes économiques sont susceptibles d'être la cible de mauvais traitements et de violence infligés par l'époux, la belle-famille ou d'autres membres de la famille. » En outre, il est mentionné dans les Réponses aux demandes d'information BGD101506.E datées du 1er août 2006 que [traduction] « la violence conjugale affecterait des femmes de diverses catégories de revenu au Bangladesh ». L'agent a également cité les Country Reports on Human Rights Practices du Département d'État américain sur la situation au Bangladesh, datant de 2010, où il est indiqué: [traduction] « Il n'existe aucun groupe de soutien adéquat pour les victimes de violence conjugale. »
[46]
L'agent a déclaré que les renseignements et les éléments de preuve produits par les demandeurs de même que les documents disponibles publiquement ne permettaient pas de conclure que les demandeurs seraient directement exposés à des difficultés personnelles liées à un risque ou à un préjudice du fait de l'époux de la demanderesse principale. L'agent aurait dû présenter la preuve extrinsèque ayant servi à tirer une conclusion qui pourrait avoir eu une incidence sur l'issue de la demande CH aux demandeurs pour obtenir leur réponse. Par conséquent, j'estime qu'il y a eu manquement à l'équité procédurale et, pour ce motif, la décision est annulée.
[47]
Étant donné que la question de l'équité procédurale est déterminante en l'espèce, il n'est pas nécessaire que je pousse l'analyse plus avant. Cependant, parce que je suis d'avis que la décision de l'agent selon laquelle le demandeur mineur ne subirait pas de difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives s'il était renvoyé au Bangladesh était déraisonnable, je vais également dire quelques mots à ce sujet.
Intérêt supérieur de l'enfant
[48]
Le juge Décary de la Cour d'appel fédérale a écrit que « [...] le concept de "difficultés injustifiées" n'est pas approprié lorsqu'il s'agit d'évaluer les difficultés auxquelles s'exposent les enfants innocents. Les enfants méritent rarement, sinon jamais, d'être exposés à des difficultés » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 75, la Cour suprême du Canada a énoncé ce qui suit au sujet de l'analyse de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant:
[75] [...] pour que l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire respecte la norme du caractère raisonnable, le décideur devrait considérer l'intérêt supérieur des enfants comme un facteur important, lui accorder un poids considérable, et être réceptif, attentif et sensible à cet intérêt. Cela ne veut pas dire que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants l'emportera toujours sur d'autres considérations, ni qu'il n'y aura pas d'autres raisons de rejeter une demande d'ordre humanitaire même en tenant compte de l'intérêt des enfants. Toutefois, quand l'intérêt des enfants est minimisé, d'une manière incompatible avec la tradition humanitaire du Canada et les directives du ministre, la décision est déraisonnable.
[50]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 12, le juge Campbell a élaboré sur l'expression « réceptif, attentif et sensible » de la Cour suprême:
[9] Être réceptif signifie être au fait de la situation. Lorsque, dans une demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, il est écrit qu'un enfant sera directement touché par la décision, l'agent des visas doit montrer qu'il est au courant de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant en indiquant les manières dont cet intérêt entre en jeu [...]
[...]
[11] [...] pour être attentif à l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, l'agent des visas doit montrer qu'il comprend bien le point de vue de chacun des participants dans un ensemble donné de circonstances, y compris le point de vue de l'enfant s'il est raisonnablement possible de le connaître.
[12] [...] Pour montrer qu'il est sensible à l'intérêt de l'enfant, l'agent doit pouvoir exposer clairement les épreuves qui résulteront pour l'enfant d'une décision défavorable, puis dire ensuite si, compte tenu également des autres facteurs, les épreuves en question justifient une dispense pour motifs d'ordre humanitaire.
[51]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agent a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte de la preuve au dossier. Je suis d'accord avec eux et j'estime que l'agent a minimisé l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant.
[52]
Je reconnais que les décideurs sont présumés avoir pris en considération toute la preuve dont ils disposent. Par conséquent, ils ne sont pas tenus de mentionner expressément chaque élément de preuve au dossier. L'omission d'analyser la preuve qui contredit la décision du tribunal est déraisonnable seulement quand les éléments de preuve qui ne sont pas mentionnés sont essentiels et contredisent la conclusion du tribunal et que la cour chargée du contrôle de la décision conclut que cette omission montre la réticence du tribunal à prendre en considération les éléments dont il disposait (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 9). Cependant, « plus la preuve qui n'a pas été mentionnée expressément ni analysée dans les motifs de l'organisme est importante, et plus une cour de justice sera disposée à inférer de ce silence que l'organisme a tiré une conclusion de fait erronée "sans tenir compte des éléments dont il [disposait]" » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (1re inst.), paragraphe 17).
[53]
Le dossier certifié du tribunal contient une lettre du demandeur mineur dont disposait l'agent. Il y est notamment écrit:
[traduction] [...] Je veux rester au Canada parce que je comprends l'anglais très bien, mais je ne sais ni parler ni écrire la langue du Bangladesh. Je veux voir mes amis et ma famille tout le temps et je veux avoir un bel avenir au Canada. Je ne connais personne de ma famille au Bangladesh.
[54]
La conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle les demandeurs ne seraient pas exposés à des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives à leur retour au Bangladesh repose en grande partie sur la conclusion selon laquelle ils recevraient le soutien de leur famille au Bangladesh. Il semble que cette dernière conclusion ait été faite sans égard au témoignage du demandeur mineur présenté à l'agent.
[55]
Aux pages 10 et 11 de la décision, l'agent a écrit ceci:
[traduction]
Je remarque que les observations précisent que le fils de la DP parle l'anglais et le français, mais ne parle pas le bengali comme sa mère; toutefois, il est raisonnable de présumer qu'il connaît les rudiments de la langue, étant donné l'engagement de sa mère auprès de la communauté bengalaise au Canada.
[...]
Aucun renseignement n'a été fourni montrant que l'enfant n'est pas demeuré en communication avec son père ou son frère au Bangladesh ou étayant l'allégation selon laquelle ils poseraient un risque pour l'enfant. Je remarque également qu'aucun des documents fourni n'indique que la famille de la DP au Bangladesh, y compris les grands-parents, tantes et oncles de l'enfant et leur famille ne pourraient lui offrir de soutien dans sa réintégration à la société du Bangladesh.
[56]
À la page 15:
[traduction]
Le père de l'enfant, son seul frère, ses grands-parents et tous ses oncles et tantes vivent au Bangladesh et doivent être considérés comme faisant partie intégrante de l'éducation de l'enfant.
[57]
L'agent affirme qu'aucune preuve ne montre que le demandeur mineur n'est pas demeuré en communication avec son père ou son frère aîné au Bangladesh. Pourtant, le demandeur mineur a écrit à l'agent pour dire: [traduction] « Je ne connais personne de ma famille au Bangladesh. » Bien que l'agent mentionne dans son analyse de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant que le père et le frère du demandeur mineur vivent au Bangladesh et doivent être considérés comme faisant partie intégrante de son éducation, le demandeur mineur ne s'est pas trouvé au Bangladesh depuis qu'il avait un an. En fait, dans la partie de la décision sur les risques et les conditions défavorables dans le pays, l'agent a déclaré que la demanderesse principale n'avait pas fourni de renseignements montrant que son mari ou son fils aîné habitaient encore au Bangladesh.
[58]
En outre, l'agent a présumé que l'enfant connaissait les rudiments de la langue bengalaise, alors que l'enfant a clairement affirmé qu'il ne parlait ni n'écrivait cette langue.
[59]
Il faut en conclure que l'agent n'a pas pris dûment en considération la lettre du demandeur mineur et a mal interprété l'engagement et le soutien que pourraient lui fournir sa famille étendue au Bangladesh.
[60]
Le défendeur établit une distinction entre la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, et la présente demande. Je conviens que les faits dans cette affaire ne sont pas les mêmes que ceux à l'origine de la présente demande. Cependant, le principe général de <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> demeure. La Cour doit examiner si l'agent s'est montré « réceptif, attentif et sensible » à l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant. Je ne suis pas convaincue que l'agent l'a été en l'espèce.
[61]
Sauf mentionner que le demandeur mineur a 15 ans, est en neuvième année et a son nom inscrit au tableau d'honneur de son école et prendre connaissance des lettres d'appui à l'enfant de ses amis proches et d'autres personnes de la communauté, l'agent n'a pas fait état de la façon dont l'intérêt supérieur du demandeur mineur serait affecté par son retour au Bangladesh.
[62]
En outre, l'agent affirme: [traduction] « Comme je l'ai indiqué précédemment, les conditions de la DP ne permettent pas de penser que son fils se trouverait dans une situation telle qu'il serait incapable d'avoir accès à des écoles ou à des soins de santé, entre autres nécessités, s'il devait retourner au Bangladesh. » Il s'agit sans doute d'une référence à la présomption de l'agent, en partie fondée sur la preuve extrinsèque, selon laquelle la demanderesse principale provient d'une famille riche. Il ne tient pas compte du fait que, au Canada, la demanderesse principale a déclaré un revenu sous le seuil de la pauvreté. L'agent semble présumer que la famille de la demanderesse principale est demeurée riche et les soutiendra, elle et son fils. Bien que cela puisse être le cas, je ne peux convenir qu'il s'agit de présomptions bien fondées compte tenu de la preuve.
[63]
L'agent a également affirmé ceci: [traduction] « La documentation dont je dispose ne me permet pas de conclure que l'enfant ne disposera pas au Bangladesh des services de base, comme une éducation et des soins de santé. » Le critère, bien entendu, n'est pas de savoir si l'enfant disposera des services de base au Bangladesh, mais plutôt de savoir quel est l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant. L'analyse de l'agent était insatisfaisante étant donné que le demandeur mineur se trouve au Canada depuis qu'il a un an et a affirmé ne pas connaître sa famille au Bangladesh ou parler la langue du pays.
Conclusion
[64]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie et la décision est renvoyée à un autre agent de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada pour qu'il rende une nouvelle décision. Aucune question grave de portée générale n'a été soumise en vue de sa certification et l'affaire n'en soulève aucune.

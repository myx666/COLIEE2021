 Overview  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] 
   
 Gagné, J. 
 : The Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Board found Mr. Eljot Kurtzmalaj, at the time a 16 year old Albanian citizen, neither a  
 Convention 
  refugee nor a person in need of protection as: i) although he had established his identity to the satisfaction of the RPD, the fact that he had not filed his original Albanian passport and birth certificate was found to undermine his overall credibility; ii) he did not have a credible subjective fear of persecution in Albania at the hands of his violent father; iii) in any case, he had an internal flight alternative [IFA] in Tirana, the capital of Albania; and finally, iv) state protection was available for the applicant in his own country. The Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] applied the reasonableness standard developed by the Supreme Court of Canada in the context of judicial review by superior courts of justice, and found that the RPD made unreasonable errors, namely, in issues i) and ii), but the RAD viewed the IFA analysis and finding as reasonable. As such, the RAD found that it did not need to rule on the state protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The only subject matter covered by this application for judicial review is therefore whether an IFA is available for the applicant in Tirana, Albania.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  For the reasons discussed below, this application for judicial review will be granted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II.  
 Background  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  The applicant's mother, father and brother live in Albania. His uncle, Altin Malaj, was designated as his representative before the RPD.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  The applicant alleged before the RPD a well-founded fear of persecution based on the risk of being abused or perhaps killed by his alcoholic and violent father who often beat him and considered him his property.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  Three years prior to his refugee claim, the applicant's father began hitting and threatening him for trying to protect his mother and brother from his father's assaults. Moreover, his father forced the applicant to work and would confiscate the money earned to buy himself alcohol.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  As a result, the applicant absented himself from school. One day, he showed up badly bruised, leading the principal and his teacher to figure out his family situation. They asked to meet with his father, who refused the invitation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The applicant eventually decided to live at a friend's home, whose parents agreed to take him in. The friend's family then helped him leave the country, in part by obtaining a false Italian passport.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  The applicant alleged that his friend's parents thought the police could not help him in any way. Instead of filing a complaint with the country's authorities, they helped him flee abroad. The applicant consulted with several adults, and they all offered the same advice.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  The applicant left for Canada where his uncle accepted to help him. He flew through the Netherlands and England, and arrived on January 16, 2013. He claimed refugee status two days later.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  The RPD concluded that even if the applicant had a credible fear, which in its view was not the case, he had an IFA in Tirana, noting that he was able to obtain all the false documents he needed in order to travel on his own to the Netherlands and Canada also that he was very mature for his age and not physically challenged.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  On May 2, 2013, the RPD informed the applicant he was neither a  
 Convention 
  refugee nor a person in need of protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The applicant appealed to the RAD.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  On July 22, 2013, the RAD confirmed the RPD's decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III.  
 The Impugned RAD's IFA finding  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The RAD analyzed the standard of review applicable to the RPD decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ 
 Newton 
 ], it held that the RPD, as a first instance tribunal, is owed deference, and thus found the grounds of appeal had to be assessed on a reasonableness standard because the issues raised questions of fact or of mixed fact of law. In its view, the RAD is not intended to act as a  
 de novo 
  appeal board, but must review whether the RPD decision falls within a range of possible outcomes, as understood by the Supreme Court of Canada's pronouncements in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  All four questions were assessed by the RAD under the reasonableness standard as they were all questions of mixed fact and law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  As indicated above, the determinative issue before the RAD was the available IFA in Tirana. Here is how the RAD disposed of the issue:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [73] Although I certainly would have articulated these reasons differently, I feel that the RPD's finding in relation to the availability of an internal flight alternative falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and the law. Consequently, the RPD did not err in applying the legal test for an internal flight alternative to the circumstances of this case.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 Issues and Standard of Review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  This application for judicial review raises the following issues:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Does the RAD owe deference to the RPD's findings of fact or mixed fact and law?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Is the RAD's IFA analysis reasonable?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  The applicant does not take a position on the standard of review that this Court should apply when reviewing the RAD's selection of its own standard of intervention when sitting in appeal of the RPD's finding of fact or mixed fact and law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  The respondent argues that questions which concern interpretation of a tribunal's own statute and function are reviewable on the reasonableness standard ( 
 Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  The question of the RAD's standard of intervention is one that is closely tied to its function and process-matters that require its high degree of expertise-which includes an interpretation of its role as situated in the administrative structure set out by the home statute. All of these factors suggest that deference is owed to the RAD's decision with respect to the selection of the appropriate standard of review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  Moreover, the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] contains a privative clause. Section 162 gives the RAD exclusive jurisdiction over all questions of law, fact and jurisdiction. This section militates in favour of deference to the RAD on all questions of law, regardless of how the applicant characterizes them.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  For the reasons set out in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (docket IMM-6640-13) [ 
 Akuffo 
 ], heard the same day as this case and argued by the same counsel for the applicant, I agree with the respondent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  In  
 Akuffo, 
  I found that in light of the consistent and firm position taken by the Supreme Court ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), the interpretation of sections 110, 111, 162 and 171 of the IRPA by the RAD did not involve questions of central importance to the legal system as a whole or any special circumstances that would require review on a correctness standard.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V.  
 Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Does the RAD owe deference to the RPD's findings of fact or mixed fact and law?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  The parties do not agree which standard of intervention the RAD must apply in appeal of RPD decisions on questions of fact or mixed fact and law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  The applicant argues that the RAD should have used the correctness standard. The RAD does not owe the RPD the same level of deference as the Alberta Court of Appeal found  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Newton 
 .  
 Newton 
  concerns the basic structure and interrelationship of the tribunals in Alberta that review the conduct of police officers when that conduct is called into question during disciplinary proceedings under the  
 Police Act 
 , RSA 2000, c P-17. The initial investigation and prosecution of police misconduct is performed within the police forces, by senior police officers. Appeals are then available to the Law Enforcement Review Board, which is a civilian tribunal. The Court of Appeal held that the court of first instance (the Presiding Officer) has considerable expertise over the matter, more so than did the appellate tribunal (Law Enforcement Review Board), which provides civilian oversight. As such, the Presiding Officer's greater expertise led to a greater deference owed. The appellate tribunal cannot ignore the Presiding Officer's determinations and conduct in a  
 de novo 
  hearing, using the correctness standard.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Meanwhile, the RPD and RAD are both divisions of the same tribunal. Both possess specialized knowledge and skills with regard to adjudicating refugee claims, therefore, there is no need for the RAD to defer to the RPD.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  It makes little or no sense to have the same tribunal favour deference to itself. This defeats the purpose of having an appeal decision at all.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  The RAD should answer the same question initially answered by the RPD: "Is the claimant a refugee or person in need of protection?" It should not ask itself "Was the RPD's decision reasonable? <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [30] 
  The respondent argues that an appellate administrative tribunal should apply the reasonableness standard when reviewing questions of fact or mixed fact and law from the decision of a lower tribunal. In reviewing a decision of the RPD which concerns pure issues of law, the RAD should use the correctness standard. Indeed, the enabling legislation, function of the tribunal, and relevant jurisprudence, establish that the appropriate standard of review on questions of fact and mixed fact and law is reasonableness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  The RPD is the trier of fact of first instance and, as such, will have the benefit of seeing the claimant and witnesses. It is, therefore, generally better placed than the RAD to assess factual and evidentiary issues, although both are engaged in refugee determination. The RAD must proceed without a hearing, on the basis of the RPD record of the proceedings, but may accept documentary evidence and written submissions. As such, it is primarily a "paper-based" appeal. The RPD is therefore better placed than the RAD to assess factual and evidentiary issues except perhaps, in exceptional instances where the RAD holds a hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  Since the case has been heard, this Court has issued several decisions dealing with the same issues and questions of general importance have been certified. Again, for a review of these decisions, I refer the parties to my reasons  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  After reasons were issued by this Court in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the parties requested and were granted permission to file additional written submissions. In these submissions, the parties reasserted their positions by citing some of the new jurisprudence particularly favourable to their arguments. With a few caveats that have no impact on the case at bar, I agree with Justice Phelan's analysis of the role and duties of the RAD when sitting in appeal of RPD decisions and when reviewing questions of fact or mixed fact and law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  As for the RPD's IFA finding, it did not turn on the applicant's credibility or on a question for which the RPD enjoyed a particular advantage. Further, the RAD has equal expertise in assessing an IFA; thus, the RAD owed no deference to the RPD on the issue and it was, in my respectful view, necessary for it to review the relevant evidence and to formulate its own opinion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  I am also of the view that the jurisprudence concerning the standard of intervention applicable to appellate Courts does not apply to the RAD any more than does the jurisprudence developed in the context of judicial review by superior Courts. The rules of evidence employed by the RPD are quite different, and far less restrictive, than those used by Courts of justice. The evidence involved in the former is often limited to the testimony of the claimant along with an abundance of documentary evidence; may it be identity documents, letters from family members, psychological reports or country conditions documents. In my view, the RPD does not enjoy a particular advantage when reviewing such documentary evidence, even if they raise questions of fact or questions of mixed fact and law. In addition, on all issues normally raised before the RPD, the RAD has an equal or even greater expertise to deal with them.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Is the RAD's IFA analysis reasonable?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  In his written submissions to the RAD, the applicant's counsel directly contested the analysis by the RPD and referred to the following relevant evidence on the record that contradicted the RPD's finding on this issue:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. There was no evidence the applicant had ever stayed in Tirana;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. He knew nobody in Tirana;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. He wasn't safe on his own in Tirana;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. He would receive no help or support in Tirana;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 5. He had nowhere else to go, except to his uncle in Montréal;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 6. There are no social safety nets in Albania for children or teens at risk;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 7. As a 16 year old child, he had few resources to fall back on as far as money, skills or education to set himself up in a different location.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  The RAD ignored this evidence in upholding the RPD's finding. Instead, the RAD merely repeated the RPD's analysis on this issue. The RAD provided no explanation why it was reasonable for the RPD to ignore evidence which suggested the applicant potentially faced undue hardship if he were forced to relocate to Tirana.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [38] 
  It was unreasonable for the RAD to accept the RPD's decision at face value and ignore what could be relevant evidence regarding the minor applicant's personal circumstances. The failure to properly assess the IFA analysis is a reviewable error.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] 
  All the more so, considering the RAD had at least some reservations about the RPD's analysis; yet it failed to note the weaknesses.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VI.  
 Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [40] 
  Thus, in my view, the applicant was entitled to benefit from a true appeal of the IFA finding, which he did not. His application for judicial review will be granted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 * * *  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [41] 
  At the hearing, counsel for the applicant suggested the following question for the purpose of certification:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • What scope and role did the Parliament intend the RAD to have over RPD decisions?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [42] 
  By letter to the Court, counsel for the respondent opposed certification because the question is too broad and not dispositive of the case. Counsel for the respondent also goes further and suggests that, should the Court deem it appropriate to certify a question, it should be the same question proposed to Justice Phelan  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [43] 
  I view the following question of general importance as being determinative of the present application for judicial review and I think it would also be determinative of an appeal:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Within the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] 's statutory framework where the appeal proceeds on the basis of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] record of the proceedings, what is the level of deference, if any, owed by the RAD to the RPD's findings of fact or mixed fact and law?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 JUDGMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [44] 
   
 THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that 
 :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. The application for judicial review is granted and the file is remitted back to a differently constituted panel of the Refugee Appeal Division for redetermination;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. The following question is certified:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Within the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] 's statutory framework where the appeal proceeds on the basis of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] record of the proceedings, what is the level of deference, if any, owed by the RAD to the RPD's findings of fact or mixed fact and law?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 .........................  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  La juge Gagné 
  [Traduction]: La Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR] de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a conclu que M. Eljot Kurtzmalaj, un citoyen de l'Albanie âgé de 16 ans à l'époque, n'avait pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger pour les motifs suivants: i) bien qu'il eût établi son identité à la satisfaction de la SPR, le fait qu'il n'avait pas produit son passeport et son certificat de naissance albanais originaux a miné sa crédibilité générale; ii) il n'avait pas de crainte subjective crédible de persécution en Albanie aux mains de son père violent; iii) en tout état de cause, il avait une possibilité de refuge intérieur [PRI] à Tirana, la capitale de l'Albanie; et enfin, iv) le demandeur pouvait se réclamer de la protection de l'État dans son propre pays. La Section d'appel des réfugiés [SAR], appliquant la norme de la décision raisonnable définie par la Cour suprême du Canada dans le contexte du contrôle judiciaire effectué par les cours supérieures de justice, a conclu que la SPR avait commis des erreurs déraisonnables, à savoir sur les questions i) et ii), mais la SAR a considéré que l'analyse et la conclusion concernant la PRI étaient raisonnables. La SAR a donc conclu qu'il n'était pas nécessaire de trancher la question de la protection de l'État.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Le seul objet de la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire consiste donc à déterminer si le demandeur a une PRI à Tirana, en Albanie.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Pour les motifs exposés ci-dessous, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire sera accueillie.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II.  
 Faits  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  La mère, le père et le frère du demandeur vivent en Albanie. L'oncle du demandeur, Altin Malaj, a été désigné pour le représenter devant la SPR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Devant la SPR, le demandeur a allégué qu'il craignait avec raison d'être persécuté parce qu'il risquait d'être maltraité ou peut-être tué par son père alcoolique et violent, qui le battait souvent et le considérait comme sa propriété.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  Trois ans avant le dépôt de la demande d'asile, le père du demandeur avait commencé à frapper son fils et à le menacer parce que le demandeur tentait de protéger sa mère et son frère des agressions de son père. De plus, le père du demandeur forçait son fils à travailler et confisquait l'argent gagné pour s'acheter de l'alcool.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Le demandeur devait donc manquer l'école. Un jour, comme il présentait de vilaines ecchymoses, son directeur et son enseignant ont compris sa situation familiale. Ils ont demandé à rencontrer le père, qui a décliné l'invitation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  Le demandeur a ensuite décidé de vivre chez un ami, dont les parents avaient accepté de l'accueillir. Puis, la famille de cet ami a aidé le demandeur à quitter le pays, notamment en lui obtenant un faux passeport italien.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  Les parents de son ami, a allégué le demandeur, pensaient que la police ne pourrait l'aider d'aucune façon. Plutôt que de déposer une plainte auprès des autorités du pays, ils ont aidé le demandeur à s'enfuir. Le demandeur a consulté plusieurs adultes, qui étaient tous du même avis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Le demandeur s'est enfui au Canada, où son oncle avait accepté de l'aider. Il est passé par les Pays-Bas et l'Angleterre, et est arrivé le 16 janvier 2013. Il a demandé l'asile deux jours plus tard.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  La SPR a conclu que, même si le demandeur avait éprouvé une crainte crédible, ce qui n'était pas le cas selon elle, il avait une PRI à Tirana. La SPR a fait remarquer que le demandeur avait pu obtenir tous les faux documents nécessaires pour se rendre seul aux Pays-Bas et au Canada, et aussi qu'il était très mature pour son âge et ne présentait pas de déficience physique.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  Le 2 mai 2013, la SPR a informé le demandeur qu'il n'avait pas la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  Le demandeur a interjeté appel auprès de la SAR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Le 22 juillet 2013, la SAR a confirmé la décision de la SPR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III.  
 La conclusion contestée tirée par la SAR quant à la PRI  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  La SAR a analysé la norme de contrôle applicable à la décision de la SPR. Invoquant l'arrêt  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ 
 Newton 
 ], la SAR a estimé que la SPR, à titre de tribunal de première instance, avait droit à la retenue et a donc conclu que les moyens d'appel devaient être appréciés selon la norme du caractère raisonnable, les questions soulevées étant des questions de fait ou des questions mixtes de fait et de droit. La SAR estimait qu'elle n'avait pas pour mission d'agir en tant que tribunal instruisant des appels  
 de novo 
 , mais qu'elle devait examiner si la décision de la SPR appartenait aux issues possibles, au sens où l'entendait la Cour suprême du Canada dans son prononcé de l'arrêt  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Les quatre questions ont toutes été examinées par la SAR selon la norme du caractère raisonnable, étant donné qu'elles constituaient toutes des questions mixtes de fait et de droit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Comme il a été indiqué ci-dessus, la question déterminante sur laquelle la SAR devait se prononcer concernait l'existence d'une PRI à Tirana. Voici comment la SAR a tranché la question:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [73] Bien que, pour ma part, j'aurais sans doute formulé différemment ces motifs, j'estime que la conclusion de la SPR relativement à la possibilité de refuge intérieur appartient aux issues possibles acceptables au regard des faits et du droit. Par conséquent, la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur lorsqu'elle a appliqué le critère juridique de la possibilité de refuge intérieur aux circonstances de la présente affaire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 Questions en litige et norme de contrôle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire soulève les questions suivantes:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1.  
 La SAR doit-elle faire preuve de retenue envers les conclusions de fait ou les conclusions mixtes de fait et de droit tirées par la SPR?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2.  
 La SAR a-t-elle fait une analyse raisonnable de la PRI?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  Le demandeur ne prend pas position sur la norme de contrôle que la Cour doit appliquer lorsqu'elle révise la norme d'intervention choisie par la SAR quand la SAR siège en appel d'une conclusion de fait ou d'une conclusion mixte de fait et de droit tirée par la SPR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Le défendeur soutient que les questions concernant l'interprétation faite par un tribunal de sa propre loi constitutive et de son mandat sont susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable ( 
 Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  La question de la norme d'intervention de la SAR est étroitement liée à son mandat et à son processus - les affaires qui requièrent le haut degré d'expertise de la SAR - ce qui comprend l'interprétation de son rôle tel qu'il s'inscrit dans la structure administrative établie par la loi constitutive. Tous ces facteurs donnent à penser qu'il convient de faire preuve de retenue envers la décision de la SAR relativement au choix de la norme de contrôle appropriée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  En outre, la  
 Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés 
 , LC 2001, c 27 [LIPR] contient une clause privative. L'article 162 confère à la SAR compétence exclusive pour connaître de toutes les questions de droit, de fait et de compétence. Cet article milite en faveur de la retenue à l'égard de la SAR sur toutes les questions de droit, peu importe comment le demandeur les caractérise.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Pour les motifs exposés dans la décision  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (dossier IMM-6640-13) [ 
 Akuffo 
 ], affaire instruite le même jour que celle-ci et plaidée par la même avocate pour le demandeur, je suis d'accord avec le défendeur.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  Dans la décision  
 Akuffo, 
  j'ai conclu que, à la lumière de la position constante et ferme adoptée par la Cour suprême ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; et  
 Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), l'interprétation des articles 110, 111, 162 et 171 de la LIPR faite par la SAR ne concerne pas les questions d'importance capitale pour le système juridique dans son ensemble ni les circonstances particulières qui seraient assujetties à la norme de contrôle de la décision correcte.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V.  
 Analyse  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1.  
 La SAR doit-elle faire preuve de retenue envers les conclusions de fait ou les conclusions mixtes de fait et de droit tirées par la SPR?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Les parties ne s'entendent pas sur la norme d'intervention que la SAR doit appliquer lorsqu'elle siège en appel de décisions rendues par la SPR sur des questions de fait ou des questions mixtes de fait et de droit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  Le demandeur soutient que la SAR aurait dû appliquer la norme de la décision correcte. La SAR n'a pas à accorder à la SPR le degré de retenue établi par la Cour d'appel de l'Alberta dans l'arrêt  
 Newton 
 . L'arrêt  
 Newton 
  porte sur la structure de base et l'interdépendance des tribunaux de l'Alberta qui examinent la conduite des agents de police quand cette conduite est remise en question au cours d'une instance disciplinaire régie par la  
 Police Act 
 , RSA 2000, c P-17. Au départ, ce sont des agents supérieurs des forces policières qui mènent l'enquête et la poursuite en cas d'inconduite de la part de la police. Ensuite, un appel peut être interjeté devant le Law Enforcement Review Board, un tribunal civil. La Cour d'appel a statué que le tribunal de première instance (l'officier président) a une expertise considérable dans ce domaine, plus que le tribunal d'appel (le Law Enforcement Review Board), un mécanisme de surveillance civile. L'expertise plus grande de l'officier président commande donc un degré de retenue plus élevé à son égard. Le tribunal d'appel ne peut faire abstraction des conclusions tirées par l'officier président et mener une audience  
 de novo 
 , en appliquant la norme de la décision correcte.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Cependant, la SPR et la SAR sont deux sections du même tribunal. Les deux possèdent des connaissances et des compétences spécialisées lorsqu'il s'agit de trancher les demandes d'asile et, par conséquent, la SAR n'a pas besoin de faire preuve de retenue envers la SPR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  Il est pour ainsi dire illogique qu'un tribunal favorise la retenue envers lui-même. Cette position va à l'encontre de l'objet même de la décision d'appel.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  La SAR doit répondre à la même question que celle à laquelle a d'abord répondu la SPR: Le demandeur a-t-il qualité de réfugié ou de personne à protéger? Elle ne doit pas se demander si la décision de la SPR était raisonnable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  Le défendeur soutient qu'un tribunal administratif d'appel doit appliquer la norme de la décision raisonnable quand elle procède au contrôle de questions de fait ou de questions mixtes de fait et de droit soulevées dans la décision d'un tribunal d'instance inférieure. Lorsqu'elle procède au contrôle d'une décision rendue par la SPR qui concerne de pures questions de droit, la SAR devrait appliquer la norme de la décision correcte. En réalité, la loi constitutive, le mandat du tribunal et la jurisprudence pertinente établissent que la norme de la décision raisonnable est celle qui s'applique aux questions de fait et aux questions mixtes de fait et de droit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  La SPR est le juge des faits de première instance et, à ce titre, elle a l'avantage de voir le demandeur d'asile et les témoins. Elle est donc généralement mieux placée que la SAR pour apprécier les questions de fait et de preuve, bien que les deux sections prennent part à la détermination du statut de réfugié. La SAR doit procéder sans audience, sur le fondement du dossier d'instance de la SPR, mais elle peut recevoir des éléments de preuve documentaire et des observations écrites. Ainsi, l'appel est essentiellement fondé sur le dossier papier. La SPR est donc mieux placée que la SAR pour apprécier les questions de fait et de preuve, sauf peut-être dans les cas exceptionnels où la SAR tient une audience.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  Depuis l'instruction de l'affaire, la Cour a rendu plusieurs décisions portant sur les mêmes questions, et des questions de portée générale ont été certifiées. Pour voir l'examen de ces décisions, les parties sont une fois encore priées de consulter les motifs que j'ai rédigés dans l'affaire  
 Akuffo 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  Après que la Cour eut rendu ses motifs dans les décisions  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  les parties ont demandé et obtenu la permission de déposer des observations écrites additionnelles. Dans ces observations, les parties ont réaffirmé leurs positions en citant une partie de la nouvelle jurisprudence particulièrement favorable à leurs arguments. Malgré quelques réserves qui n'ont aucune incidence sur la présente espèce, je souscris à l'analyse que le juge Phelan a faite du rôle et des obligations de la SAR lorsqu'elle siège en appel de décisions rendues par la SPR et lorsqu'elle procède au contrôle de questions de fait ou de questions mixtes de fait et de droit.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  La conclusion sur la PRI tirée par la SPR ne concernait pas la crédibilité du demandeur ni une question pour laquelle la SPR profitait d'un avantage particulier. De plus, la SAR a autant d'expertise pour évaluer une PRI; par conséquent, la SAR n'avait pas à faire preuve de retenue envers la SPR sur cette question et il était, à mon humble avis, nécessaire pour elle d'examiner les éléments de preuve pertinents et de former sa propre opinion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  Je suis également d'avis que la jurisprudence concernant la norme d'intervention applicable aux cours d'appel ne s'applique pas plus à la SAR que la jurisprudence établie dans le contexte du contrôle judiciaire effectué par les cours d'instance supérieure. Les règles de la preuve appliquées par la SPR sont assez différentes des règles des cours de justice, et beaucoup moins restrictives qu'elles. Les éléments de preuve présentés à la SPR se résument souvent au témoignage du demandeur d'asile et à une abondante preuve documentaire, qu'il s'agisse de pièces d'identité, de lettres de membres de la famille, de rapports psychologiques ou de documents sur la situation dans le pays visé. À mon avis, la SPR ne profite pas d'un avantage particulier quand elle examine une telle preuve documentaire, même quand elle soulève des questions de fait ou des questions mixtes de fait et de droit. De plus, la SAR a autant d'expertise que la SPR, voire davantage, pour traiter toutes les questions normalement soulevées devant la SPR.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2.  
 La SAR a-t-elle fait une analyse raisonnable de la PRI?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  Dans les observations écrites qu'il a présentées à la SAR, le conseil du demandeur a directement contesté l'analyse faite par la SPR et renvoyé aux éléments de preuve pertinents suivants qui figuraient au dossier et qui contredisaient la conclusion de la SPR sur cette question:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Rien ne montrait que le demandeur avait déjà demeuré à Tirana;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Le demandeur ne connaissait personne à Tirana;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. Il ne serait pas en sécurité seul à Tirana;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. Il ne recevrait ni aide ni soutien à Tirana;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 5. Il n'avait nulle part où aller, sauf chez son oncle à Montréal;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 6. Il n'y a pas de filet de sécurité sociale en Albanie pour les enfants ou les adolescents à risque;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 7. Come enfant de 16 ans, il pouvait compter sur peu de ressources en termes d'argent, de compétences ou d'études pour s'établir dans un autre lieu.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  La SAR a fait abstraction de ces éléments de preuve en confirmant la conclusion de la SPR et s'est plutôt contentée de répéter simplement l'analyse de cette question faite par la SPR. La SAR n'a pas expliqué pourquoi il était raisonnable pour la SPR de ne pas tenir compte d'éléments de preuve qui indiquaient que le demandeur serait peut-être exposé à des difficultés excessives s'il était forcé de se réinstaller à Tirana.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [38] 
  Il était déraisonnable pour la SAR d'accepter sans réserve la décision de la SPR et d'ignorer ce qui pouvait constituer des éléments de preuve pertinents à propos de la situation personnelle du demandeur mineur. Le défaut d'évaluer dûment l'analyse de la PRI constitue une erreur susceptible de contrôle.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] 
  C'est d'autant plus vrai que la SAR avait au moins quelques réserves à propos de l'analyse effectuée par la SPR, mais a néanmoins omis d'en relever les faiblesses.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VI.  
 Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [40] 
  Donc, à mon avis, le demandeur avait droit à un véritable appel de la conclusion sur la PRI, ce qu'il n'a pas eu. Sa demande de contrôle judiciaire sera accueillie.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 [41] 
  À l'audience, l'avocate du demandeur a proposé la question suivante aux fins de certification:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Quelle latitude et quel rôle le législateur avait-il l'intention de conférer à la SAR par rapport aux décisions rendues par la SPR?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [42] 
  Dans une lettre adressée à la Cour, l'avocat du défendeur s'est opposé à la certification parce que la question est trop vaste et ne permettrait pas de trancher l'affaire. L'avocat du défendeur va encore plus loin en avançant que, si la Cour estimait approprié de certifier une question, la question devrait être la même que celle qui avait été proposée au juge Phelan dans l'affaire  
 Huruglica.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [43] 
  À mon avis, la question de portée générale qui suit est déterminante dans la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire et je crois qu'elle permettrait également de trancher l'appel:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Dans le contexte du cadre législatif de la Section d'appel des réfugiés [SAR] où les appels sont instruits sur le fondement du dossier d'instance de la Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR], de quel degré de retenue, le cas échéant, la SAR doit-elle faire preuve à l'égard des conclusions de fait ou des conclusions mixtes de fait et de droit tirées par la SPR?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 2. La question suivante est certifiée:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 • Dans le contexte du cadre législatif de la Section d'appel des réfugiés [SAR] où les appels sont instruits sur le fondement du dossier d'instance de la Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR], de quel degré de retenue, le cas échéant, la SAR doit-elle faire preuve à l'égard des conclusions de fait ou des conclusions mixtes de fait et de droit tirées par la SPR?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Summary: 
 
 Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer and its president S. Pfeiffer were licensed bankruptcy trustees. The Superintendent of Bankruptcy appointed a panel under ss. 14.01 and 14.02 of the Bankruptcy Act to consider whether the bankruptcy trustees' licences should be cancelled. The trustees filed a motion for a declaration of lack of jurisdiction, arguing that ss. 14.01 and 14.02 were contrary to s. 7 of the Charter, s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights and contrary to the principles of natural justice. The panel dismissed the motion, holding that it did not have power to determine constitutional questions. The trustees applied for judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, dismissed the application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Tremblay-Lamer, J. 
  [Translation]: There are two applications for judicial review before the court in which the applicants are seeking to have set aside the decision of Marc Lamarre, Brian Doyle and Uwe Manski, in their capacity as delegates of the powers of investigation and hearing vested in the Superintendent of Bankruptcy under the  
 Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
  (R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as amended by S.C. 1992, c. 27) [the " 
 Act 
 "], holding that they did not have jurisdiction to find ss. 14.01 and 14.02 of the  
 Act 
  to be unconstitutional, or jurisdiction to declare those sections to be inoperative and contrary to the  
 Canadian Bill of Rights 
  (S.C. 1960, c. 44, reproduced in R.S.C. 1985, App. III) [the " 
 Bill of Rights 
 "].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer has held a licence as a trustee in bankruptcy since 1980. The applicant Sydney Pfeiffer has also held such a licence since 1974. He is the president of the firm Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer, which administers more than 1,600 estates and whose personnel consists of two trustees and 48 employees. The intervenor Guylaine Houle, who also holds a licence as a trustee in bankruptcy, is a shareholder and director of Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  During December 1991 and January 1992, the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, with the assistance of the personnel under his direction and control, conducted an audit of the activities of the applicants, and in April 1992 the applicants received a report prepared by Andy J. Blitzer, C.A.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  On December 11, 1992, Mr. Pfeiffer received a letter from Marc Mayrand, Deputy Superintendent of Bankruptcy (Operations), to which was attached a draft report recommending that the Superintendent cancel the applicants' trustee licence. The report noted flaws in the administration of some estates which violated the  
 Act 
 , the Regulations, the Guidelines and the Policies. More specifically, the report pointed to the following anomalies:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) investing consolidated estate funds in trust companies and treasury bills;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) registering certificates of deposit of consolidated funds not in trust for estates;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) under-allocating interest to estate files;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) withdrawing final fees without recognizing the interim draw already taken;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (e) withdrawing fees in excess of the fees taxed;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (f) delegating signing authority on checks (sic) to an unauthorized person.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  On April 28, 1993, the solicitor for Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer wrote a letter to the office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy setting out a list of reasons why Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer should retain its trustee licence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  On June 16, 1993, Marc Mayrand signed a report similar to the draft that had been submitted to the parties earlier, recommending nonetheless that the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, George F. Redling, cancel the applicants' trustee licence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  On December 31, 1993, the Superintendent of Bankruptcy informed the parties that under s. 14.01(2) of the  
 Act 
 , he had delegated his powers and functions as Superintendent to a panel composed of Marc Lamarre, a retired judge, as Chairman of the panel, and Brian Doyle and Uwe Manski, both trustees in bankruptcy. Accordingly, the Superintendent issued a delegation instrument authorizing the panel to act in accordance with the powers conferred by the  
 Act 
 . The panel's specific mandate is described in the delegation instrument as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "1. considering the report in respect of the trustee received by the Superintendent from the Deputy;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "2. affording the trustee the opportunity to be heard required by subs. 14.02(1) of the  
 BIA 
  in respect of the Deputy's report and notice of intention to exercise the powers set out in paragraphs 14.01(1)(a) to (c) of the  
 BIA 
  in relation to the trustee's licence;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "3. determining, in conformity with the provisions of paragraphs 14.02(2)(b) and (c) and in consultation with the trustee and the Deputy or their respective counsel, the procedural rules that shall apply in the course of affording the trustee the opportunity to be heard;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "4. conducting, under the presidency of the chairman, the hearing at which the trustee is given the opportunity to be heard;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "5. causing, for the purposes of paragraph 14.02(2)(d) of the  
 BIA 
 , a stenographic, electronic or other record to be taken of the proceedings at which the trustee is given the opportunity to be heard;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "6. considering the evidence and submissions of the trustee and the Deputy;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "7. deciding whether, on the balance of the evidence before the panel, the recommendation of the Deputy in respect of the license of the trustee should be accepted, varied or rejected, and, in accordance with subs. 14.02(4) of the  
 BIA 
 , to give the decision and the reasons for the decision of the panel in writing to the trustee and to the Deputy within ninety days after the conclusion of the hearing; and,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "8. where the panel accepts or varies the recommendation of the Deputy and decides to exercise the power to suspend or cancel the license of the trustee, directing, after hearing representations from the trustee and the Deputy, another or other trustees to deal, in the manner directed by the panel, with the property in the estates that were, immediately prior to the cancellation or suspension of the licence, under the administration of the trustee. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [8] 
  On June 3, 1994, the applicants filed a "Motion for declaration of lack of jurisdiction" with the panel. They were arguing, primarily, that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "- sections 14.01 and 14.02 of the  
 Act 
  are unconstitutional, in that they violate s. 7 of the  
 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
 . (Part I of the  
 Constitution Act, 1982 
 , comprising Schedule B to the  
 Canada Act, 1982 
  (U.K.), 1982, c. 11)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "- sections 14.01 and 14.02 of the  
 Act 
  are inoperative because they are inconsistent with paragraph 2(e) of the  
 Bill of Rights 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "- the process of investigation and hearing established by ss. 14.01 and 14.02 of the  
 Act 
  violate the impartiality requirements imposed by the principles of natural justice. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [9] 
  Accordingly, they asked the panel to declare that it was not competent to proceed, having regard to the invalidity of ss. 14.01 and 14.02 of the  
 Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  On September 1, 1995, the panel rendered its decision in which it concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of the sections in question. It concluded as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The tribunal and/or the Superintendent does not have and has never had the power in its enabling statute to review the constitutionality of its duties and the powers conferred on it by the  
 Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
 . No such power, whether express or implied, is found anywhere in the  
 Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "We have no jurisdiction to determine constitutional questions, or to made declarations that only the superior courts may make, or to determine the constitutional validity of the enabling statute under which our mandate was given to us.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "For the foregoing reasons, the two motions by the applicants Sydney H. Pfeiffer and Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer Inc. are denied. (sic) <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [11] 
  That decision is the subject of this judicial review. However, on November 9, 1995, the respondent filed a motion to strike out the two originating notices of motion. On the consent of the parties, Mr. Justice Teitelbaum ordered that the motion be heard at the hearing on the merits. At the time of the hearing before me, the respondent chose not to argue that motion at any length, although it remains in the record. I shall therefore deal with it first.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
 	1. Are these originating notices of motion premature, in that the decision of the panel is interlocutory, and should they accordingly be struck out?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Did the panel err in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction to declare that ss. 14.01 and 14.02 of the  
 Act 
  are unconstitutional and inoperative?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. Are ss. 14.01 and 14.02 inoperative in that they are inconsistent with para. 2(e) of the  
 Bill of Rights 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Legislation  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  Sections 14.01 and 14.02 of the  
 Act 
  provide:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "14.01(1) The Superintendent, after making or causing to be made an investigation into the conduct of a trustee, may, where it is in the public interest to do so,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) cancel the licence of a trustee;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) suspend the licence of a trustee; or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) place such conditions or limitations on the licence of a trustee as the Superintendent considers appropriate.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "14.01(2) The Superintendent may delegate by written instrument, on such terms and conditions as are therein specified, any or all of the Superintendent's powers, duties and functions under paragraphs 1(a) to (c) or s. 14.01 or 14.03.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "14.01(3) Where the Superintendent delegates in accordance with subs. (2), the Superintendent or the delegate shall  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) where there is a delegation in relation to trustees generally, give written notice of the delegation to all trustees; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) whether or not paragraph (a) applies, give written notice of the delegation of a power to any trustee who may be affected by the exercise of that power, either before the power is exercised or at the time the power is exercised.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "14.02(1) Where the Superintendent intends to exercise any of the powers set out in paragraphs 14.01(1)(a) to (c), the Superintendent shall send the trustee written notice of the powers that the Superintendent intends to exercise and the reasons therefor and afford the trustee a reasonable opportunity for a hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "14.02(2) At a hearing referred to in subs. (1), the Superintendent  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) has the power to administer oaths;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence in conducting the hearing;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (c) shall deal with the matters set out in the notice of the hearing as informally and expeditiously as the circumstances and a consideration of fairness permit; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) shall cause a summary of any oral evidence to be made in writing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "14.02(3) The notice referred to in subs. (1) and, where applicable, the summary of oral evidence referred to paragraph 2(d), together with such documentary evidence as the Superintendent receives in evidence, form the record of the hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "14.02(4) The decision of the Superintendent after a hearing referred to in subs. (1), together with the reasons therefor, shall be given in writing to the trustee not later than 90 days after the conclusion of the hearing and may, where the Superintendent considers it in the public interest to do so, be made public after the decision has been given to the trustee.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "14.02(5) A decision of the Superintendent given pursuant to subs. (4) is deemed to be a decision of a federal board, commission or other tribunal that may be reviewed and set aside pursuant to the Federal Court Act. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Preliminary Motion To Strike Out 
 
 The Originating Notices Of Motion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  The Attorney General submitted that the application for judicial review brought by the applicants from the decision of the panel is premature because that decision was in fact an interlocutory decision. The respondent relied on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in which Mr. Justice Létourneau held that as a general rule, time should not be spent on reviewing interlocutory decisions, except in special circumstances. According to the respondent, the court has jurisdiction to dismiss the originating notices of motion under its general power, as governed by s. 5 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The applicants argued, for their part, that it was not premature to raise the issue of bias before the panel. It is settled law that bias on the part of a tribunal must be raised without delay. For example, in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to raise the issue of bias at the first opportunity amounted to waiver of that ground for challenging the jurisdiction of the tribunal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  In my opinion, there is an initial procedural problem, since the  
 Federal Court Rules 
  make no provision for dismissing a motion. ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)) Although the Attorney General cited s. 5, it is used only in exceptional cases. In the instant case, the decision relates to the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal to determine constitutional questions or make declaratory judgments. The tribunal held that it did not have jurisdiction to determine such a question. The same situation arose in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), and the court decided the issue immediately on an application for judicial review.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  review could be permitted in interlocutory cases on the question of jurisdiction, at p. 3:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "... where the motion itself is apt to be time consuming and where there is, as here, a clear question of jurisdiction which may determine the entire matter, common sense dictates, and rule 5 permits, that the court deal with the preliminary objection in advance. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [18] 
  As well, it appears that judicial review of a decision of a tribunal relating to a question of jurisdiction may avoid the costs of a hearing on the merits. In  
 Danmour Shoes Co., Re 
 , [1974] 1 F.C. 22; 1 N.R. 422 (F.C.A.), at p. 34  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Federal Court of Appeal held:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In my view, the object of ss. 18 and 28 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
   
 is to provide a speedy and effective judicial supervision of the work of federal boards, commissions and other tribunals 
  with a minimum of interference with the work of those tribunals. Applying s. 11 of the  
 Interpretation Act 
 , with that object in mind, to the question raised by these s. 28 applications,  
 it must be recognized that the lack of a right to have the court review the position taken by a tribunal as to its jurisdiction or as to some procedural matter, at an early stage in a hearing, may well result, in some cases, in expensive hearings being abortive. On the other hand, a right, vested in a party who is reluctant to have the tribunal finish its job, to have the court review separately each position taken, or ruling made, by a tribunal in the course of a long hearing would, in effect, be a right vested in such party to frustrate the work of the tribunal. 
 " (Emphasis mine)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  In my opinion, since this issue involves an attack on the very existence of the tribunal, there is a special reason permitting judicial review at this stage of the proceedings. (Cases in which the court has intervened in interlocutory decisions:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at p. 140  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "it is a final decision that disposes of a substantive question before the tribunal".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Accordingly, the motion to strike is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Power Of The Tribunal To Examine 
 
 Questions Relating To The Charter 
 
 And The Bill Of Rights  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  The applicants and the intervenor submitted that the role played by the Minister's delegates is comparable to that played by an administrative tribunal in that they exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power. (R. Dussault and L. Borgeat,  
 Traité de droit administratif 
 , vol. 1, 2 
 e 
  éd., Ste-Foy, Presses de l'Université Laval, 1984, at pp. 156-163; P. Garant,  
 Précis de droit des administrations publiques 
 , Cowansville, Yvon Blais, 1987, at pp. 65-66, 76-77; P. Garant,  
 Droit administratif 
 , vol. 1, Cowansville, Yvon Blais, 1991, at pp. 159-163.) The guiding principles that apply in this area are set out in three decisions of the Supreme  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 271; 81 D.L.R.(4th) 121 and  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 358. These decisions hold that an administrative tribunal may have jurisdiction to determine constitutionality, either by virtue of the power conferred by s. 24(1) of the  
 Charter 
  or by virtue of a tribunal's duty to apply the  
 Constitution 
  in carrying out the mandate assigned to it by statute and under s. 52 of the  
 Constitution Act, 1982 
 . In the instant case, the applicants suggested that in the absence of specific enabling provisions in the  
 Act 
  itself, the Minister's delegates very probably do not have the powers set out in s. 24 of the  
 Charter 
 . However, it has been recognized that the power to apply the  
 Constitution 
  under s. 52 of the  
 Constitution Act, 1982 
  may devolve to a tribunal, either expressly or by implication. In the case at bar, it is clear that the Minister's delegates must apply and interpret at least the  
 Act 
  in order to determine whether the applicants have violated its provisions. Inter alia, since it is alleged that the applicants acted improperly in the management of their trust accounts, the Minister's delegates will surely have to determine how s. 25 of the  
 Act 
  is to be interpreted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  For his part, the Attorney General submitted that the Superintendent is neither a tribunal nor a court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of determining the constitutionality of ss. 14.01 and 14.02 of the  
 Act 
  under s. 24 of the  
 Charter 
  and s. 52 of the  
 Constitution Act, 1982 
  and in accordance with the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada. (

  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 1; 115 W.A.C. 1.) The respondent argued that the question was settled by the decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  (supra, para. [16]) and there was nothing substantially different in the situation now before the court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  In short, we must examine the trilogy of decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Douglas College 
 ,  
 Cuddy Chicks 
  and  
 Tétreault-Gadoury 
  with respect to the jurisdiction of administrative tribunals to determine  
 Charter 
  questions. The issue in the case at bar is not the application of s. 24(1) of the  
 Charter 
 , which allows a court of competent jurisdiction to grant a remedy. Rather, we shall have to consider the application of s. 52 of the  
 Constitution Act, 1982 
 , which provides:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "52(1) The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [24] 
  With respect to the application of this section by an administrative tribunal, the principle set out in  
 Douglas College 
  is that an administrative tribunal which is given the power to interpret any statute also has the power to determine whether the statute is constitutional. The decision in  
 Cuddy Chicks 
  established that a tribunal whose task it is to determine questions of law may also apply the  
 Charter 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Mr. Justice La Forest summarized the situation as follows in  
 Cuddy Chicks 
 , at pp. 14 and 15  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "... An administrative tribunal need not meet the definition of a court of competent jurisdiction in s. 24(1) of the  
 Charter 
  in order to have the necessary authority to subject its enabling statute to  
 Charter 
  scrutiny. In the present case, the relevant inquiry is not whether the tribunal is a 'court' [within the meaning of subs. 24(1) of the  
 Charter 
 ] but whether the legislature intended to confer on the tribunal the power to interpret and apply the  
 Charter 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "... The legislature expressly, and without reservation, conferred authority on the Board to decide points of law. In addition, the  
 Act 
  confers powers on the Board to determine questions of law and fact relating to its own jurisdiction. Section 124, for example, gives it authority to decide if a matter is arbitrable. The issue, then, is whether this authority with respect to questions of law can encompass the question of whether a law violates the  
 Charter 
 . It is clear to me that a  
 Charter 
  issue must constitute a question of law; indeed, the  
 Charter 
  is part of the supreme law of Canada. This comports with the view expressed in  
 Douglas College 
  that the statutory authority of the arbitrator in that case to interpret any 'Act' must include the authority to interpret the  
 Charter 
 . <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [26] 
  In  
 Tétreault-Gadoury 
  (supra, para. [21] at p. 32  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .), the Supreme Court of Canada held that the powers of an administrative tribunal to determine questions of law and to interpret any law could derive not only from an express power but also from an implied power. This statement of the law was reiterated in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), in which the court stated, at p. 20  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Recent Supreme Court of Canada decisions have confirmed that where an administrative tribunal has an express authority to interpret and apply statutes ( 
 Douglas College 
 , supra, para. [21]) or where it has been expressly authorized to determine questions of law ( 
 Cuddy  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , para. [21]) it may apply the  
 Charter 
  to determine the validity of laws it is applying.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  37-38  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) the court also held that such power may be implied even though not expressly granted. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [27] 
  In  
 Laflamme 
  (supra, para. [16]), the provisions of the  
 Act 
  were similar to those with which we are concerned in the case at bar. Mr. Justice Noël was of the opinion that the legislative grant of authority must give the tribunal not only the power to interpret its enabling legislation, but also jurisdiction over the subject matter resulting from reliance on the  
 Charter 
  and the remedy sought. In that case, the court held that those powers must be found in the enabling statute and be among the powers that Parliament intended to confer on it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  While I have reached the same conclusion as Mr. Justice Noël, I shall not follow the same route as my colleague did. In my view, this is the approach that must be taken when the issue is whether the tribunal in question is a court of competent jurisdiction within the meaning of s. 24(1) of the  
 Charter 
 . This analysis is not required when the issue is the power of an administrative tribunal to examine the constitutionality of its enabling statute under s. 52 of the  
 Constitution Act, 1982 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 321, and more recently in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s. 24(1), that is, that a tribunal will be a court of competent jurisdiction only if it has jurisdiction over the parties, the subject matter of the proceedings and the remedy sought. These tests had long since been established, in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 81; 52 C.R.(3d) 1; 29 D.L.R.(4th) 161; 26 C.C.C.(3d) 481, for the purpose of determining whether a tribunal is a court of competent jurisdiction.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  In addition, in  
 Cuddy Chicks 
 , Mr. Justice La Forest himself acknowledged that this analytical framework, that is, that there must be jurisdiction over the whole of the matter before the tribunal, reflects the prerequisites for a tribunal to be a court of competent jurisdiction within the meaning of s. 24(1) of the  
 Charter 
 , but that an administrative tribunal  
 need not meet the definition of a court of competent jurisdiction 
  in order to have the necessary authority to subject its enabling statute to  
 Charter 
  scrutiny. ( 
 Cuddy Chicks 
 , at p. 14 S.C.R.)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  Despite what he said in  
 Cuddy Chicks 
  and his intention of analysing the case from the standpoint of s. 52, Mr. Justice La Forest continued his analysis by applying the three-pronged test, as if the issue was whether it was a court of competent jurisdiction under s. 24(1). This is the same type of analysis as was done by Mr. Justice Noël  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  (supra, para. [16]).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  In the instant case, I do not believe that it is necessary to analyze the question from this standpoint, since, as Mr. Justice La Forest stated, the tribunal need not meet the definition of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the case at bar, no remedy is sought. Rather, the parties are seeking a declaration that certain provisions of the  
 Act 
  are inoperative since they are contrary to the  
 Charter 
 . ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a remedial power, and s. 52(1) a declaratory power, to be exercised in disposing of matters properly before the court. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [33] 
  In my opinion, we must determine whether Parliament gave the tribunal, in its enabling statute, expressly or by implication, a duty to examine questions of law. This is the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  What are the powers of the Superintendent or his delegates? The Superintendent has the power to suspend or cancel the licence of a trustee or place such conditions on the licence as he considers appropriate where it is in the public interest to do so, after affording the trustee an opportunity for a hearing.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  Of course, in order to do that, he must apply his enabling statute. In my opinion, however, that is not sufficient for us to conclude that he has the power to determine questions of law. As Mr. Justice Noël stated  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 , (supra, para. [16]), all administrative tribunals may apply their enabling statute. We must analyse the statutory provision, the object of the provision and the general scheme of the  
 Act 
  in order to determine whether Parliament intended to give the tribunal the power to decide questions of law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  In the case at bar, after examining the statutory provisions, I conclude that the panel, through the Superintendent or his delegates, did not have the power to determine questions of law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  Quite the contrary; Parliament has provided an informal process for hearings, and specified that the Superintendent is not bound by the rules of evidence. Matters must be dealt with as the circumstances and a consideration of fairness permit. There is nothing in these provisions to indicate any intention to give the panel responsibility for determining questions of law. In addition, Parliament did not deem it advisable to grant the panel certain powers of investigation under the  
 Inquiries Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-11, which powers the Court of Appeal took into account in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Racette-Villeneuve 
  (supra, para. [37]), in which I held that the Entitlement Board had jurisdiction to determine  
 Charter 
  questions, several statutory provisions in the enabling legislation implicitly gave the Entitlement Board the power to rule on questions of law. For example, the enabling statute provided that the Board had to provide the applicant with a summary of the law applicable to the applicant's case and the Board's interpretation thereof, to hold hearings in camera if it considered that this would not be contrary to the public interest (such a finding necessarily involves points of law) and to determine the legal duty to maintain. In addition, the  
 Act 
  granted it certain powers under the  
 Inquiries Act 
  (supra, para. [37]).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] 
  I was compelled to conclude from that analysis that the panel could determine questions of law. This is not the case here. I have been unable to find any provision that indicates that Parliament intended to assign any such responsibility to it. The panel therefore did not err in determining that it did not have the power to decide the constitutional questions submitted.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [40] 
  The applicant Sydney Pfeiffer did not apply for a declaration, as he could have under s. 18(3) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  (supra, para. [14]). He therefore did not serve the notice of constitutional question required by s. 57 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 . Accordingly, this court cannot consider the question of whether the statutory provisions violate his rights under s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
  and para. 2(e) of the  
 Bill of Rights 
 . It has been settled since  
 Tétreault-Gadoury 
  (supra, para. [21]), that in a judicial review the court is limited to "overseeing and controlling the legality" [see footnote 1] of administrative decisions and has no "jurisdiction to make a final determination of the constitutional question" [see footnote 2] where the administrative tribunal does not itself have jurisdiction over constitutional questions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [41] 
  The applicant Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer has asked for a declaration that ss. 14.01 and 14.02 of the  
 Act 
  are inoperative and contrary to the  
 Bill of Rights 
 . Accordingly, the corporate applicant served the constitutional notice required by s. 57 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  (supra, para. [14]). The  
 Bill of Rights 
  will be examined only insofar as that application was made by the corporate applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [42] 
  Of course, Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer could not have argued that the provisions of the  
 Act 
  violate its rights under s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
 . The wording of s. 7 provides that "everyone" has the right to protection of life, liberty and security of the person.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Q.A.C. 2; 58 D.L.R.(4th) 577; 25 C.P.R.(3d) 417, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the expression "everyone" excluded corporations and included only human beings. As well, in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.S.R.(2d) 181; 258 A.P.R. 181, the court again held that a corporation could not be deprived of the right to life, liberty or security of the person, and accordingly that it could not rely on s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. Are The Provisions Of The Act 
 
 Inoperative In That They Are Contrary 
 
 To Paragraph 2(e) Of 
 
 The Canadian Bill Of Rights?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [43] 
  Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer contended that the provisions of the  
 Act 
  are inoperative as contrary to paragraph 2(e) of the  
 Canadian Bill of Rights 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [44] 
  Paragraph 2(e) of the  
 Bill of Rights 
  provides:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "2. [Construction of law] Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (e) deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 The first issue here is the scope of the expression "person" which is found in paragraph 2(e).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of Appeal, commenting on para. 2(e), stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In this section the word 'person' is used in contexts which suggest that it is concerned with natural persons but I see no compelling reason why the word should not be interpreted as referring as well to corporations wherever the subject matter of a provision in which it is found can have application to corporations. Paragraph 2(e) is, in my view, such a provision. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [45] 
  It is therefore possible, in the case at bar, for the corporation to rely on s. 2(e). Accordingly, we must consider whether, in the instant case, the  
 Act 
  deprives the corporation of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of its rights and obligations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [46] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal set out the tests that must be met before it can be found that s. 2(e) of the  
 Bill of Rights 
  has been violated, at pp. 877-878  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "...  
 Firstly 
 , it must be shown that a party's 'rights and obligations' fall to be determined by a federal tribunal; and,  
 secondly 
 , it must be established that the party concerned was not afforded a 'fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice'. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [47] 
  The decision in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , gave renewed scope to the  
 Canadian Bill of Rights 
 . Madame Justice Wilson acknowledged that the dichotomy between privileges and rights had played a role in narrowing the scope of the  
 Bill of Rights 
 , and that the analysis that derived from that dichotomy could not apply in relation to the  
 Charter 
 . She therefore turned to the  
 Charter 
  for her analysis of the issue in  
 Singh 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [48] 
  However, Mr. Justice Beetz chose to interpret the  
 Immigration Act 
  having regard to the  
 Bill of Rights 
 . With respect to the first criterion to be met, in relation to the definition of "rights and obligations", he stated, at p. 228  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Be that as it may, it seems clear to me that the ambit of s. 2(e) is broader than the list of rights enumerated in s. 1 which are designated as 'human rights and fundamental freedoms' whereas in s. 2(e), what is protected by the right to a fair hearing is the determination of one's 'rights and obligations', whatever they are and whenever the determination process is one which comes under the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada. It is true that the first part of s. 2 refers to 'the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared', but s. 2(e) does protect a right which is fundamental, namely 'the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice' for the determination of one's rights and obligations, fundamental or not. It is my view that ... the right guaranteed by s. 2(e) is in no way qualified by the 'due process' concept mentioned in s. 1(a). <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [49] 
  Mr. Justice Beetz concluded that the process of determining refugee claims involved the determination of rights and obligations. However, he added:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "... It follows also that this case is distinguishable from cases where a mere privilege was refused or revoked, such as  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ." (at p. 228  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [50] 
  Most importantly, Mr. Justice Beetz concluded that the "rights" referred to in s. 2(e) of the  
 Bill of Rights 
  included rights that went beyond the fundamental rights usually recognized under the concept of "natural justice" or "procedural fairness". However, a case must nonetheless involve the determination of a person's " 
 rights 
 ", and a mere  
 privile 
 ge will not be protected by s. 2(e).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [51] 
  The question is therefore whether the revocation of a licence to carry on one's business meets the definition of the determination of a right.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [52] 
  There is a body of case law that recognizes that the practice of a profession may constitute a right, and that this right may be protected by either s. 7 of the  
 Charter 
  [see footnote 4] or s. 23 of the  
 Quebec Charter 
  ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Que. C.A.), at pp. 310-311). It could be argued that this characterization is appropriate, by analogy, in the context of our analysis of s. 2(e) of the  
 Bill of Rights 
 . I do not believe so. As we saw earlier, Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer alone has brought an application under s. 2(e). A corporation, unlike an individual, cannot claim to be practising a profession. The interests of the corporation in the case at bar are purely economic, and accordingly obtaining a licence can result in nothing more, in my opinion, than a privilege.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [53] 
  A "licence" is defined in the  
 Petit Larousse 
 , 1985 as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [Translation] "... Permission granted by the public authorities to practise certain professions, and to import or export various products; authorization to exploit a patent ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [54] 
   
 Stroud's Judicial Dictionary 
 , (5th Ed., 1986), defines a licence as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "When one finds the word 'licence' used in a statute the presumption is that it is intended to designate a purely personal privilege. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [55] 
  It is quite common for it to be necessary to obtain a licence in order to operate a business. For example, the individual in question in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 385 (F.C.A.), had a commercial fishing licence. The Federal Court of Appeal held that the issuance of a licence was a function of the Minister's discretion, and added, at p. 394 [D.L.R.]:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "... It is clear law that a fishing licence is a privilege granted by the Minister and in the renewal of which the licence holder has no vested right ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [56] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the renewal of broadcasting licences to the company in question. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the broadcasting company had a licence at the time a direction concerning renewal was issued, and held, with respect to the application of para. 2(e) of the  
 Bill of Rights 
 , at p. 429  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The appellant had, however, no vested or other property right to have its licences renewed or to have the authority of the Commission maintained either until the disposition of its application or for the future. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [57] 
  Having regard to these decisions, it would be difficult for me to conclude that the revocation of the applicants' licence meets the definition of a "right". In the circumstances, since this was merely a privilege, Pfeiffer & Pfeiffer does not satisfy the first element of the test developed  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
  and accordingly cannot rely on s. 2(e) of the  
 Bill of Rights 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [58] 
  For these reasons, the applications for judicial review are dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Applications dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

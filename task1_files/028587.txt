I.
Nature of the Matter
[1]
Locke, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of the July 10, 2013 decision (the Decision) of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board finding the Applicants to be neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27.
II.
Facts
[2]
The Applicants in this case are a 46-year-old woman (the Primary Applicant) and her 19-year-old son. Both are citizens of Nigeria. They are Christians and, as a result, they claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of Boko Haram, a militant Islamic group based in Nigeria. More specifically, they fear the son of their previous landlord who is involved with Boko Haram and who previously attacked their family.
[3]
In July 2009, the Applicants moved from Lagos, a state in Southern Nigeria, to Borno State in the North. On January 1, 2010, members of Boko Haram ambushed the compound where the Applicants were living, killing four people, including the Primary Applicant's sister-in-law. Although their landlord was a Muslim, he hid the Applicants and their family when Boko Haram arrived. Later that evening, he arranged for them to escape and told them to leave the North.
[4]
On their way back to Lagos, the Applicants claim they were followed by members of Boko Haram, including their landlord's son. During a stop-over in Benin City, this group chased down the Applicants' family. The Primary Applicant's husband and daughter escaped into a bus, while she and her two sons were run over. One of the sons was killed. Both Applicants were seriously injured and hospitalized.
[5]
Following this incident, the Applicants returned to their home in Ojokoro, Lagos, where they remained until leaving for Canada in November 2011. They fear they will be attacked if they return home because their former landlord's son knows where they live. They did not take refuge in another part of the country because they fear that Boko Haram's influence is spreading.
[6]
The Applicants arrived in Edmonton on November 30, 2011, and travelled to Fort McMurray, where the Primary Applicant's daughter is attending school on a student visa. They made a claim for refugee protection on December 19, 2011.
III.
Decision Under Review
[7]
The RPD dismissed the Applicants' claim after finding that they would be safe if they relocated to the Niger Delta region of Nigeria or a different district within Lagos. This is referred to as an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA). It reached this conclusion after reviewing the documentary evidence and finding that Boko Haram's activities are largely concentrated in Northern and Central Nigeria where hostilities between Christians and Muslims are high. It also found that, although Boko Haram has carried out targeted attacks against Christians, it has likely killed more Muslims because its operations are based in the Muslim-dominated North.
[8]
On the issue of credibility, the RPD found that the Applicants did not provide sufficient documentary evidence to corroborate the incident that occurred in Benin City. Nor did they corroborate their move to Borno State in 2009. Despite these concerns, the RPD accepted the factual basis of the Applicants' narratives for the purposes of the IFA analysis.
[9]
The RPD found that the majority of Nigeria's Christians are concentrated in the South, including around the Niger Delta. Therefore, it would not be unreasonable for the Applicants to relocate to this area because they would not be prevented from practising their religion. With regard to Lagos, the RPD noted that the Primary Applicant's husband currently resides there, and that the Applicants lived there without incident from January 2010, until they left for Canada in November 2011.
[10]
The RPD concluded that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the Applicants to relocate to the Niger Delta because the Primary Applicant has a number of skills that would enable her to find new employment and they would not be prevented from practising their religion.
IV.
Issues
[11]
This matter raises the following issue:
1. Did the RPD reasonably conclude that the Applicants had a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in the Niger Delta region or within Lagos?
V.
Submissions of the Parties
A.
Applicants' Submissions
[12]
The Applicants rely on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], which set out a two-part test to determine whether a refugee claimant has a viable IFA. First, the Board must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility the claimant will face persecution in the part of the country where it finds an IFA to exist. Second, after considering all of the circumstances, including those particular to the applicant, the Board must find that it would not be unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge in that location (at para 10).
[13]
The Applicants submit that the RPD erred in determining they had an IFA for two reasons. First, it only gave reasons for why the Niger Delta is a reasonable IFA, but did not explain why Lagos is a reasonable IFA. Second, the RPD did not consider the Applicants' specific circumstances before concluding that they would not face a risk of persecution in the Niger Delta because the majority of the population in that region is Christian. This conclusion fails to account for the fact that they were already attacked by Boko Haram and the Primary Applicant's other son was killed during that incident.
[14]
The RPD also erred in concluding that because Boko Haram has killed both Muslims and Christians, the Applicants "will not be subjected to violence or attacks that are not faced by the general population as a whole." The Applicants submit that there is no evidence to support the conclusion that Muslims are killed because they are Muslim. Rather, Boko Haram targets only those who are opposed to the creation of an Islamic state, which includes Christians as well as some Muslims. Therefore, the Applicants are not at risk because the general population is subject to attacks, but rather, they are at risk because they belong to a specific group - Christians who have previously been attacked by Boko Haram.
[15]
The RPD failed to consider and analyze all of the documentary evidence, which confirms that Boko Haram's activities are not limited to the Northern parts of Nigeria. The Applicants refer to several passages from the U.S. Department of State's
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011 - Nigeria
(the Country Report) which suggest that Boko Haram's activities are more widespread:
One of the most serious human rights problems during the year were abuses committed by the militant sect known as Boko Haram, which is responsible for killings, bombings, and other attacks throughout the country.
The militant sect known as Boko Haram perpetrated killings and bomb attacks throughout the country. The sect continued to mount regular assaults and bombings in Borno and Bauchi states. The sect claimed responsibility for the January 1 bombing of the Mogadishu Barracks in Abuja, the July 16 suicide bombing of the police headquarters in Abuja, and the August 26 suicide bombing of the UN headquarters in Abuja. By the end of the year, the government and Boko Haram had not engaged in dialogue.
Killings and kidnappings by militant groups in the Niger Delta continued, despite the president Yar'Adua's offer of amnesty in October 2009.
The militant Islamic group is fighting to overthrow the government and create an Islamic state.
Boko Haram have issued a statement calling for continued violence until the country embraces Islam.
[16]
The RPD has an obligation to provide reasons for why it prefers other evidence when "there is important evidence that runs directly contrary to the Board's finding on a central issue" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The RPD's failure to consider the evidence from the Country Report, or to comment on why it did not accept this evidence, has tainted the decision and therefore the decision should be considered a nullity (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 863).
B.
Respondent's Submissions
(1) Standard of Review
[17]
The RPD's conclusion on the existence of an IFA is a finding of fact, which is reviewable on the standard of reasonableness. Therefore, this finding ought to be accorded a substantial degree of deference. The reviewing Court should only intervene if it finds the RPD's decision to be unreasonable. A reasonable decision is one that is based on conclusions that are justifiable, transparent and intelligible (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
(2) Internal Flight Alternative
[18]
On the first branch of the test from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Respondent submits that it was reasonable for the RPD to conclude that the Applicants do not face a serious possibility of persecution in the Niger Delta because the majority of the population there is Christian. The evidence before the Board did not support the Applicants' contention that Boko Haram is active throughout Nigeria. Rather, the relevant country reports indicated that their activities are largely confined to Northern Nigeria, where the majority of the population is Muslim.
[19]
It was also reasonable for the Board to conclude that another part of Lagos offered a viable IFA because the Applicants adduced no evidence of mistreatment while residing there from January 2010, until their departure to Canada in November 2011. Nor did they provide any evidence that the Primary Applicant's husband has experienced mistreatment while remaining in Lagos.
[20]
On the second branch of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test, the Respondent submits the RPD reasonably concluded that it would not be unreasonable for them to relocate to the Niger Delta. The Applicants did not adduce "actual and concrete evidence" of any conditions that would jeopardize their life or safety in the Niger Delta or Lagos. The Primary Applicant also failed to establish that she would not be able to find employment in Niger Delta.
[21]
The Respondent rejects the argument that the RPD failed to consider relevant documentary evidence, which according to the Applicants, confirms the presence of Boko Haram throughout Nigeria. When these passages are viewed in their proper documentary context, it becomes apparent that the RPD did not err in concluding that Boko Haram's activities are confined to Northern Nigeria.
[22]
For example, the first two passages cited by the Applicants are extracted from the Country Report's half-page Executive Summary, which is intended to provide only a general snapshot of human-rights abuse in Nigeria. The remaining body of the report explains that Boko Haram's hostilities are concentrated in North and Central Nigeria. The Country Report does not mention any hostilities occurring in the Southern region.
[23]
Furthermore, the RPD referred to three other reports to substantiate its conclusion that Boko Haram's activities are concentrated in North and Central Nigeria. The general statements do not contradict nor supersede the specific references to states, cities and districts in Northern Nigeria where Boko Haram is active.
VI.
Analysis
A.
Standard of Review
[24]
The determination of a viable internal flight alternative is a fact-driven analysis that should be reviewed on the reasonableness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[25]
Therefore, the RPD's conclusion that the Applicants have a viable IFA will not be disturbed unless it can be shown that this conclusion does not fall within the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 47).
B.
Internal Flight Alternative
[26]
I agree with the Respondent that the RPD came to a reasonable conclusion in finding that it would not be unreasonable for the Applicants to resettle in the Niger Delta or to relocate within Lagos.
[27]
As noted by both parties, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal set out a two-part test for establishing an IFA. To reiterate, in order to find an IFA, the RPD must be satisfied that (1) the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the part of the country where the IFA is alleged to exist and (2) in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, the conditions in that part of the country are such that it would not be unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge there (at para 10).
[28]
Once the possibility of an IFA is raised, the burden shifts to the claimant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that "there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country, including the area which is alleged to afford an IFA" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 9 (FCA) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). This is an objective test. Therefore, "if there is a safe haven for claimants in their own country, where they would be free of persecution, they are expected to avail themselves of it unless they can show that it is objectively unreasonable for them to do so" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 12).
(1) No serious possibility of persecution where IFA is alleged to exist
[29]
According to the Applicants, the RPD failed to provide reasons for why a different neighbourhood or district in Lagos would provide a reasonable IFA. However, a review of the decision shows that the RPD gave a number of reasons to support its finding that the Applicants did not face a serious possibility of persecution if they were to move within Lagos: (1) the Primary Applicant's husband recently returned there after visiting in Canada; (2) the Applicants returned there after the alleged attack in 2010; (3) the Applicants resided there without incident from January 2010, until leaving in November 2011; and (4) the Primary Applicant's husband continues to live there without reported incident.
[30]
The test for establishing a well-founded fear of persecution is forward-looking (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Nevertheless, the RPD is required to assess past incidents of persecution as this evidence "is one of the most effective means of showing that a fear of future persecution is objectively well-founded" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[31]
In this case, the RPD's decision demonstrates that, despite having some credibility concerns, it accepted the past incident described in the Applicants' narrative. Furthermore, the reasons described above show that the RPD considered whether the Applicants experienced any additional persecution while living in Lagos. The record does not reveal any events involving Boko Haram, or their former landlord's son, after the January 2010 incident.
[32]
With regard to the forward-looking aspect of the test, the RPD also satisfied itself that the Applicants were not at risk for future persecution by Boko Haram in either Lagos or the Niger Delta. The RPD reached this conclusion after reviewing the documentary evidence and finding that Boko Haram is not active in Southern Nigeria.
[33]
The Applicants contend that in reaching this conclusion, the RPD failed to consider all of the evidence, or at least provide reasons for why it ignored certain evidence. It is well-established that the RPD is presumed to have considered all of the evidence, absent strong indications to the contrary (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In this case, the Applicants failed to rebut this presumption. I agree with the Respondent that the passages cited by the Applicants are taken out of context or are too generalized to be considered contrary to the other findings made by the RPD. The Country Report clearly explains that Boko Haram's presence is not widespread through Nigeria, but is actually concentrated in Borno and Yobe States in the North.
[34]
Other evidence supports the RPD's finding that Boko Haram's activities are confined to Northern and Central Nigeria. In reviewing the articles and reports submitted to the RPD, I found only one article that refers to an attack planned by Boko Haram in Lagos. However, the Nigerian authorities prevented this bombing before it occurred. The remaining evidence referred to Boko Haram attacks directed towards Christians in the Northern states of Borno, Bauchi, Yobe and Kano, as well as the central provinces of Kaduna and Plateau, and Nigeria's capital city, Abuja.
[35]
The Applicants also allege that the RPD erred on the first prong of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test because it did not consider their specific circumstances as Christians who have already been attacked by Boko Haram. As noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a refugee claimant has the onus to establish every part of the refugee claim, including whether it would be unreasonable to seek refuge in a proposed IFA. In this case, the Applicants failed to adduce any evidence that their position as Christians who have already been attacked by Boko Haram put them at risk for future attacks in the Southern part of Nigeria.
[36]
When the Primary Applicant was asked at the hearing whether she would be safe in another part of the country, she responded that the problem is "all over" and "nowhere is safe." However, she did not provide further detail to explain why she feels unsafe everywhere. Nor did she provide details about why she continues to fear her former landlord's son, other than explaining that he knows where their current family home is located.
[37]
For all of these reasons, the RPD reasonably concluded that the Applicants, as Christians who have already been attacked by Boko Haram, do not face a serious risk of persecution if they relocate within Lagos or to the Niger Delta.
(2) Not objectively unreasonable for claimant to seek refuge in IFA
[38]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Linden JA elaborated on the meaning of an "unreasonable" IFA:
the alternative place of safety must be realistically accessible to the claimant. Any barriers to getting there should be reasonably surmountable. The claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling there or in staying there ...But neither is it enough for refugee claimants to say that they do not like the weather in a safe area, or that they have no friends or relatives there, or that they may not be able to find suitable work there. If it is objectively reasonable in these latter cases to live in these places, without fear of persecution, then IFA exists and the claimant is not a refugee.
(at para 14)
[39]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the Federal Court of Appeal interpreted Linden JA's comments in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> as establishing
a very high threshold for the unreasonable test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.
(at para 15)
[40]
The Respondent submits that the Applicants did not adduce "actual or concrete evidence" of any conditions that would jeopardize their lives and safety in the Niger Delta or Lagos. I agree. As discussed above, there was no evidence before the Board to show that Boko Haram is active in either of these regions, or that they would encounter Boko Haram while travelling to the Niger Delta.
[41]
The second branch of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test requires the RPD to consider "all of the circumstances including circumstances particular to [the Applicants] " (at para 10). In this case, the RPD considered that the Applicants would not be prevented from practising their religion because the majority of the population in the Niger Delta is Christian. The evidence supports this finding. Therefore, it was reasonable for the RPD to conclude that the Applicants would be able to practice their faith if they relocated.
[42]
The RPD also found that because the Primary Applicant is "industrious and resourceful" and worked as a nurse for many years in Nigeria, there is no reason why she would not be able to continue her previous career if she returned to Nigeria. The Applicants did not adduce any evidence to suggest she would not be able to find employment if she returned to Nigeria. Therefore, absent any evidence to the contrary, the RPD reasonably concluded that it would not be unreasonable for the Applicants to relocate within Lagos or to the Niger Delta.
VII.
Conclusions
[43]
For all of the preceding reasons, the RPD's conclusion that the Applicants have a viable IFA is justified, transparent and intelligible, and therefore should not be disturbed (
Dunsumir
at para 47). As a result, this application for judicial review should be dismissed.
[44]
Neither party has proposed a question of general importance for certification.
JUDGMENT
[45]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application is dismissed;
2. No serious question of general importance is certified.

[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire visant la décision en date du 10 juillet 2013 (la décision) par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (CISR) a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger au sens des articles 96 et 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27.
II.
Les faits
[2]
Les demandeurs en l'espèce sont une femme âgée de 46 ans (la demanderesse principale) et son fils âgé de 19 ans, tous deux citoyens du Nigéria. Ils sont chrétiens et disent craindre avec raison d'être persécutés par le groupe de militants islamistes Boko Haram, établi au Nigéria, en raison de leur foi. Plus précisément, ils craignent le fils de leur ancien propriétaire qui est mêlé au groupe Boko Haram et qui a déjà agressé leur famille.
[3]
En juillet 2009, les demandeurs ont déménagé de Lagos, un État du sud du Nigéria, à l'État de Borno, dans le nord. Le 1er janvier 2010, des membres de Boko Haram ont tendu une embuscade dans le périmètre où vivaient les demandeurs et tué quatre personnes, dont la belle-sœur de la demanderesse principale. Bien que musulman, leur propriétaire a caché les demandeurs et leur famille à l'arrivée des membres de Boko Haram. Plus tard dans la soirée, il a organisé leur fuite et leur a dit de quitter la région du nord.
[4]
Les demandeurs affirment qu'ils étaient suivis par des membres de Boko Haram sur le chemin du retour à Lagos, notamment par le fils de leur propriétaire. Lors d'un arrêt à Benin City, les membres du groupe se sont mis à pourchasser la famille des demandeurs. L'époux et la fille de la demanderesse principale ont pris la fuite à bord d'un autobus, tandis que la demanderesse principale et ses deux fils ont été renversés par une voiture. L'un des fils a été tué. Les deux demandeurs ont été gravement blessés et hospitalisés.
[5]
À la suite de l'incident, les demandeurs sont retournés à leur domicile à Ojokoro, à Lagos, où ils sont demeurés jusqu'à leur départ pour le Canada en novembre 2011. Ils craignent d'être agressés s'ils retournent chez eux parce que le fils de leur ancien propriétaire sait où ils habitent. Ils n'ont pas cherché refuge dans une autre région du pays, car ils craignent que l'influence de Boko Haram ne cesse de s'étendre dans le pays.
[6]
Les demandeurs sont arrivés à Edmonton le 30 novembre 2011 et ils se sont rendus à Fort McMurray, où la fille de la demanderesse principale fait des études, munie d'un visa d'étudiant. Ils ont présenté une demande d'asile le 19 décembre 2011.
III.
Décision contrôlée
[7]
La SPR a rejeté la demande des demandeurs après avoir conclu qu'ils seraient en sécurité s'ils déménageaient dans la région du delta du Niger au Nigéria ou dans un autre district de Lagos. Il s'agit d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI). Elle est arrivée à cette conclusion après avoir examiné la preuve documentaire et conclu que les activités de Boko Haram sont principalement concentrées dans le nord et dans le centre du Nigéria où les hostilités entre les chrétiens et les musulmans sont vives. Elle a également conclu que même si Boko Haram a mené des attaques ciblées contre les chrétiens, le groupe a probablement tué plus de musulmans parce qu'il concentre ses activités dans le nord, où vivent principalement des musulmans.
[8]
Sur la question de la crédibilité, la SPR a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas fourni suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour corroborer l'incident survenu à Benin City. Ils n'ont pas non plus produit d'élément de preuve attestant leur déménagement dans l'État de Borno en 2009. Malgré ces réserves, la SPR a reconnu le fondement factuel de l'exposé circonstancié des demandeurs pour les besoins de l'analyse relative à la PRI.
[9]
La SPR a conclu que la majorité de la population chrétienne du Nigéria vit dans le sud, entre autres dans la région du delta du Niger. Par conséquent, il ne serait pas déraisonnable pour les demandeurs de déménager dans cette région, car ils ne seraient pas empêchés de pratiquer leur religion. En ce qui concerne Lagos, la SPR a constaté que l'époux de la demanderesse principale y réside actuellement, et que les demandeurs y ont vécu sans incident de janvier 2010 jusqu'à leur départ pour le Canada en novembre 2011.
[10]
La SPR a conclu qu'il ne serait pas objectivement déraisonnable pour les demandeurs de déménager dans la région du delta du Niger, étant donné que la demanderesse principale possède plusieurs compétences grâce auxquelles elle pourrait se trouver un nouvel emploi, et qu'ils pourraient pratiquer leur religion librement.
IV.
Questions en litige
[11]
La Cour doit trancher la question suivante en l'espèce:
1. La SPR pouvait-elle raisonnablement conclure que les demandeurs avaient une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI) valable dans la région du delta du Niger ou à Lagos?
V.
Observations des parties
A.
Observations des demandeurs
[12]
Les demandeurs se fondent sur la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], dans laquelle est exposé un critère à deux volets permettant de déterminer si un demandeur d'asile dispose d'une PRI valable. Premièrement, la Commission doit pouvoir conclure, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'il n'y a aucune possibilité sérieuse de persécution contre le demandeur dans la partie du pays où il y a, selon elle, une PRI. Deuxièmement, après avoir examiné toutes les circonstances, y compris celles qui sont propres au demandeur, la Commission doit conclure qu'il n'aurait pas été déraisonnable que le demandeur cherche refuge dans ce lieu (au paragraphe 10).
[13]
Les demandeurs affirment que la SPR a commis une erreur en concluant qu'ils avaient une PRI, et ce, pour deux raisons. Premièrement, la SPR a seulement donné les raisons pour lesquelles le delta du Niger constitue une PRI raisonnable, mais n'a pas expliqué pourquoi Lagos est une PRI raisonnable. Deuxièmement, la SPR n'a pas tenu compte des circonstances propres aux demandeurs avant de conclure qu'ils ne seraient pas exposés à un risque de persécution dans le delta du Niger parce que la majorité de la population de la région est chrétienne. Cette conclusion ne tient pas compte du fait qu'ils avaient déjà été agressés par des membres du groupe Boko Haram et que l'autre fils de la demanderesse principale avait été tué lors de l'incident.
[14]
La SPR a également commis une erreur en concluant que puisque le groupe Boko Haram a tué des musulmans et des chrétiens, les demandeurs « ne [seront] pas expos[és] à des actes de violence ou à des attaques auxquels l'ensemble de la population n'est pas elle aussi exposée ». Les demandeurs font valoir que rien n'appuie la conclusion selon laquelle les musulmans sont tués en raison de leur foi musulmane. Le groupe Boko Haram cible plutôt seulement les opposants à la création d'un État islamique, ce qui comprend les chrétiens autant que certains musulmans. Par conséquent, les demandeurs ne sont pas exposés à un risque parce que la population générale est visée par les attaques, mais plutôt parce qu'ils font partie d'un groupe précis, soit les chrétiens qui ont déjà été agressés par des membres de Boko Haram.
[15]
La SPR a omis de prendre en considération et d'analyser l'ensemble de la preuve documentaire, laquelle confirme que les activités de Boko Haram ne sont pas limitées à la région du nord du Nigéria. Les demandeurs renvoient à plusieurs passages du document intitulé
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011 - Nigeria
(le rapport national) du Département d'État des États-Unis qui permettent de penser que les activités de Boko Haram sont plus étendues:
[traduction]
[L]es atteintes les plus graves aux droits de la personne survenues pendant l'année sont les abus commis par la secte militante connue sous le nom de Boko Haram, qui est à l'origine de meurtres, d'attentats à la bombe et d'autres attaques dans l'ensemble du pays.
La secte militante connue sous le nom de Boko Haram a commis des meurtres et des attentats à la bombe dans l'ensemble du pays. La secte a continué à organiser des attaques et des bombardements régulièrement dans les États de Borno et de Bauchi. La secte a revendiqué le bombardement de casernes de Mogadiscio du 1er janvier à Abuja, l'attentat-suicide à la bombe contre le quartier général de la police du 16 juillet à Abuja, et l'attentat-suicide contre le quartier général des Nations Unies du 26 août à Abuja. À la fin de l'année, le gouvernement et Boko Haram n'avaient pas entamé de dialogue.
Les groupes militants ont continué de commettre des meurtres et des enlèvements dans le delta du Niger malgré l'offre d'amnistie du président Yar'Adua en octobre 2009.
Le groupe militant islamiste se bat pour renverser le gouvernement et instaurer un État islamique.
Boko Haram a publié une déclaration dans laquelle il appelait à poursuivre la lutte armée tant que le pays ne serait pas converti à l'Islam.
[16]
La SPR a l'obligation d'expliquer la raison pour laquelle elle préfère une autre preuve « lorsqu'il existe une preuve importante qui va directement à l'encontre de la conclusion de la Commission sur une question fondamentale » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le fait que la SPR a omis de tenir compte d'éléments de preuve tirés du rapport national, ou d'expliquer pourquoi elle n'avait pas accepté cet élément de preuve, a entaché la décision et celle-ci devrait être considérée comme nulle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , à la page 863).
B.
Observations du défendeur
(1) Norme de contrôle
[17]
La conclusion de la SPR sur l'existence d'une PRI est une conclusion de fait qui appelle la norme de la décision raisonnable. Par conséquent, cette conclusion commande un degré élevé de retenue. La cour de révision ne devrait intervenir que si elle conclut que la décision de la SPR était déraisonnable. Une décision raisonnable repose sur des conclusions qui sont justifiables, transparentes et intelligibles (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ).
(2) Possibilité de refuge intérieur
[18]
Au premier volet du critère énoncé dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le défendeur affirme qu'il était raisonnable pour la SPR de conclure que les demandeurs ne sont pas exposés à un risque sérieux de persécution dans le delta du Niger parce que la majorité de la population y est chrétienne. La preuve dont la Commission disposait ne corroborait pas l'allégation des demandeurs selon laquelle Boko Haram est actif dans l'ensemble du Nigéria. D'après les rapports pertinents sur la situation dans le pays, le groupe concentre ses activités dans le nord du Nigéria, où la population est majoritairement musulmane.
[19]
La Commission pouvait aussi raisonnablement conclure qu'une autre région de Lagos pouvait constituer une PRI valable parce que les demandeurs n'ont présenté aucun élément de preuve montrant qu'ils avaient été victimes de mauvais traitements lorsqu'ils y avaient résidé de janvier 2010 jusqu'à leur départ pour le Canada en novembre 2011. Qui plus est, ils n'ont fourni aucun élément de preuve montrant que l'époux de la demanderesse principale avait été victime de mauvais traitements lorsqu'il vivait à Lagos.
[20]
En ce qui concerne le deuxième volet du critère exposé dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le défendeur affirme que la SPR a raisonnablement conclu qu'il ne serait pas raisonnable que les demandeurs déménagent dans la région du delta du Niger. Les demandeurs n'ont pas présenté une « preuve réelle et concrète » de l'existence de conditions qui mettraient en péril leur vie ou leur sécurité dans la région du delta du Niger ou à Lagos. La demanderesse principale n'a pas non plus réussi à établir qu'elle ne pourrait pas trouver un emploi dans la région du delta du Niger.
[21]
Le défendeur rejette l'argument selon lequel la SPR a omis de tenir compte d'éléments de preuve pertinents qui, selon les demandeurs, confirment que le groupe Boko Haram est présent dans l'ensemble du Nigéria. L'examen de ces passages à la lumière de l'ensemble de la documentation montre clairement que la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur en concluant que les activités de Boko Haram sont limitées au nord du Nigéria.
[22]
Par exemple, les deux premiers passages cités par les demandeurs sont tirés du sommaire d'une demi-page du rapport national, qui vise uniquement à donner un aperçu général des violations des droits de la personne au Nigéria. Il est expliqué dans le rapport que les hostilités commises par le groupe Boko Haram sont concentrées dans le nord et le centre du Nigéria. Le rapport national ne fait aucunement mention d'hostilités qui se seraient déroulées dans le sud.
[23]
De plus, la SPR a fait référence à trois autres rapports pour appuyer sa conclusion selon laquelle les activités du groupe Boko Haram sont concentrées dans le nord et le centre du Nigéria. Les énoncés généraux ne contredisent pas et ne remplacent pas les références précises aux États, aux villes et aux districts dans le nord du Nigéria où le groupe Boko Haram est actif.
VI.
Analyse
A.
Norme de contrôle
[24]
Une conclusion relative à l'existence d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur valable résulte d'une analyse fondée sur les faits et doit faire l'objet d'un contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[25]
Par conséquent, la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle les demandeurs ont une PRI valable ne peut être infirmée sauf s'il peut être montré qu'elle n'appartient pas « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47).
B.
Possibilité de refuge intérieur
[26]
Je conviens avec le défendeur que la SPR a tiré une conclusion raisonnable selon laquelle il ne serait pas raisonnable pour les demandeurs de s'installer dans la région du delta du Niger ou de s'installer ailleurs à Lagos.
[27]
Comme les deux parties l'ont souligné, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour d'appel fédérale a établi un critère à deux volets pour établir l'existence d'une PRI. Rappelons que, pour conclure qu'une PRI existe, la SPR doit être convaincue 1) que le demandeur ne risque pas sérieusement d'être persécuté dans la région du pays où, selon elle, il existe une PRI et 2) que les conditions régnant dans cette partie du pays sont telles qu'il ne serait pas déraisonnable, en toutes circonstances, y compris celles qui sont propres au demandeur, que celui-ci y cherche refuge (au paragraphe 10).
[28]
Si la question de la possibilité de refuge intérieur est soulevée, il incombe au demandeur de prouver, selon la prépondérance des possibilités, « qu'il risque sérieusement d'être persécuté dans tout le pays, y compris la partie qui offrait prétendument une possibilité de refuge » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 9 (CAF) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ). Il s'agit d'un critère objectif. Par conséquent, « s'il existe dans leur propre pays un refuge sûr où ils ne seraient pas persécutés, les demandeurs de statut sont tenus de s'en prévaloir à moins qu'ils puissent démontrer qu'il est objectivement déraisonnable de leur part de le faire » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 12).
(1) Aucune possibilité sérieuse de persécution dans la région dans laquelle il est allégué qu'une PRI existe
[29]
Selon les demandeurs, la SPR a omis d'expliquer pourquoi un autre quartier ou district à Lagos constituerait une PRI raisonnable. Cependant, l'examen de la décision révèle que la SPR a fourni un certain nombre de raisons pour appuyer sa conclusion selon laquelle les demandeurs ne seraient pas exposés à un risque sérieux de persécution s'ils s'installaient ailleurs à Lagos: 1) l'époux de la demanderesse principale y est récemment retourné après avoir effectué une visite au Canada; 2) les demandeurs y étaient retournés après l'agression alléguée de 2010; 3) les demandeurs y ont résidé sans incident de janvier 2010 jusqu'à leur départ en novembre 2011; 4) l'époux de la demanderesse principale continue d'y vivre et aucun incident n'a été rapporté.
[30]
Le critère permettant d'établir le fondement d'une crainte de persécution est prospectif (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La SPR est néanmoins tenue d'évaluer les événements de persécution antérieurs, puisque ceux-ci « constituent l'un des meilleurs moyens de démontrer le bien-fondé objectif d'une crainte de persécution future » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[31]
En l'espèce, il ressort de la décision que la SPR a admis l'incident antérieur décrit dans l'exposé circonstancié des demandeurs, malgré certaines réserves. De plus, les raisons exposées précédemment montrent que la SPR a examiné si les demandeurs avaient aussi fait l'objet de persécution lorsqu'ils vivaient à Lagos. Le dossier ne fait état d'aucun incident impliquant le groupe Boko Haram, ou le fils de l'ancien propriétaire des demandeurs, qui serait survenu après l'incident de janvier 2010.
[32]
En ce qui concerne l'aspect prospectif du critère, la SPR était également convaincue que les demandeurs ne risquaient pas d'être persécutés à l'avenir par le groupe Boko Haram, ni à Lagos ni dans la région du delta du Niger. La SPR est venue à cette conclusion après avoir passé en revue la preuve documentaire et conclu que le groupe Boko Haram n'est pas actif dans le sud du Nigéria.
[33]
Les demandeurs font valoir qu'en tirant cette conclusion, la SPR n'a pas tenu compte de tous les éléments de preuve ou, à tout le moins, expliqué pourquoi elle avait laissé certains éléments de côté. Il est bien établi que la SPR est réputée avoir tenu compte de toute la preuve qui lui a été présentée, en l'absence d'éléments indiquant fortement le contraire (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Les demandeurs n'ont pas réussi à réfuter cette présomption en l'espèce. Je suis d'accord avec le défendeur pour affirmer que les passages cités par les demandeurs sont utilisés hors contexte ou sont trop généraux pour pouvoir être considérés comme allant à l'encontre des autres conclusions tirées par la SPR. Il est clairement expliqué dans le rapport national que la présence de Boko Haram n'est pas répandue dans tout le Nigéria, mais qu'elle se concentre en fait dans le nord du pays, soit dans l'État de Borno et dans l'État de Yobe.
[34]
D'autres éléments de preuve corroborent la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle les activités de Boko Haram sont circonscrites dans le nord et le centre du Nigéria. En examinant les articles et les rapports soumis à la SPR, je n'ai trouvé qu'un seul article faisant mention d'une attaque planifiée par le groupe Boko Haram à Lagos. Toutefois, les autorités du Nigéria ont réussi à empêcher que ce bombardement ne se produise. Les autres éléments de preuve faisaient état d'attaques de Boko Haram ciblant directement des chrétiens au nord, dans les États de Borno, de Bauchi, de Yobe et de Kano, ainsi que dans les provinces centrales de Kaduna et de Plateau, et dans la capitale du Nigéria, Abuja.
[35]
Les demandeurs allèguent en outre que la SPR a commis une erreur en ce qui a trait au premier volet du critère énoncé dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , car elle n'a pas tenu compte de leur situation propre qui est celle de chrétiens ayant déjà été agressés par des membres de Boko Haram. Comme il est souligné dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il incombe au demandeur de prouver chaque élément de sa demande d'asile, y compris de déterminer s'il serait déraisonnable de chercher refuge dans une PRI suggérée. En l'espèce, les demandeurs n'ont fourni aucune preuve établissant que leur situation de chrétiens ayant déjà été agressés par le groupe Boko Haram les expose à un risque d'être agressés à l'avenir dans le sud du Nigéria.
[36]
Lorsqu'il a été demandé à la demanderesse principale à l'audience si elle pouvait être en sécurité dans une autre partie du pays, elle a répondu que le problème est [traduction] « partout » et [traduction] « [qu'] aucun endroit n'est sûr ». Toutefois, elle n'a donné aucun autre détail pour expliquer pourquoi elle ne se sent en sécurité nulle part. Elle n'a pas non plus précisé pourquoi elle continue de craindre le fils de son ancien propriétaire, ayant seulement expliqué qu'il sait où le domicile actuel de la famille est situé.
[37]
Pour toutes ces raisons, la SPR a raisonnablement conclu que les demandeurs, en tant que chrétiens ayant déjà été agressés par des membres de Boko Haram, ne seraient pas exposés à un risque sérieux d'être persécutés s'ils se réinstallaient ailleurs à Lagos ou dans la région du delta du Niger.
(2) Il n'est pas objectivement déraisonnable pour la demanderesse de chercher refuge dans la PRI
[38]
Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Linden a précisé le sens de PRI « déraisonnable », au paragraphe 14:
[...] l'autre partie plus sûre du même pays doit être réalistement accessible au demandeur. S'il y a des obstacles qui pourraient se dresser entre lui et cette autre partie de son pays, le demandeur devrait raisonnablement pouvoir les surmonter. On ne peut exiger du demandeur qu'il s'expose à un grand danger physique ou qu'il subisse des épreuves indues pour se rendre dans cette autre partie ou pour y demeurer. [...] Par contre, il ne leur suffit pas de dire qu'ils n'aiment pas le climat dans la partie sûre du pays, qu'ils n'y ont ni amis ni parents ou qu'ils risquent de ne pas y trouver de travail qui leur convient. S'il est objectivement raisonnable dans ces derniers cas de vivre dans une telle partie du pays sans craindre d'être persécuté, alors la possibilité de refuge dans une autre partie du même pays existe et le demandeur de statut n'est pas un réfugié.
[39]
Selon l'interprétation qu'en fait la Cour d'appel fédérale dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 15, les commentaires du juge Linden dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> montrent
qu'il [faut] placer la barre très haut lorsqu'il s'agit de déterminer ce qui est déraisonnable. Il ne faut rien de moins que l'existence de conditions qui mettraient en péril la vie et la sécurité d'un revendicateur tentant de se relocaliser temporairement en lieu sûr. De plus, il faut une preuve réelle et concrète de l'existence de telles conditions.
[40]
Le défendeur affirme que les demandeurs n'ont pas produit une « preuve réelle et concrète » montrant l'existence de conditions qui mettraient en péril leur vie et leur sécurité dans la région du delta du Niger ou à Lagos. J'en conviens. Comme il a déjà été mentionné, rien dans la preuve ne permettait à la Commission de conclure que Boko Haram est actif dans l'une ou l'autre de ces régions, ou que les demandeurs rencontreraient des membres de Boko Haram en se rendant dans la région du delta du Niger.
[41]
Le second volet du critère exposé dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> exige que la SPR tienne compte de l'ensemble des circonstances, dont celles qui sont propres aux demandeurs (au paragraphe 10). En l'espèce, la SPR a estimé que les demandeurs ne seraient pas empêchés de pratiquer leur religion parce que la majorité de la population dans le delta du Niger est chrétienne. La preuve étaye cette conclusion. Par conséquent, il était raisonnable pour la SPR de conclure que les demandeurs pourraient pratiquer leur religion s'ils se réinstallaient ailleurs.
[42]
La SPR a également conclu que, étant donné que la demanderesse principale est « une personne débrouillarde et une travailleuse acharnée » et qu'elle a exercé le métier d'infirmière pendant de nombreuses années au Nigéria, rien ne porte à croire qu'elle ne serait pas en mesure de travailler à ce titre si elle retournait dans ce pays. Les demandeurs n'ont pas soumis d'éléments de preuve permettant de croire qu'elle ne pourrait trouver un emploi si elle retournait au Nigéria. Par conséquent, en l'absence de tout élément de preuve contraire, la SPR a raisonnablement conclu qu'il ne serait pas déraisonnable pour les demandeurs de se réinstaller à Lagos ou dans la région du delta du Niger.
VII.
Conclusion
[43]
Compte tenu de l'ensemble des motifs susmentionnés, la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle les demandeurs disposent d'une PRI valable est justifiée, transparente et intelligible, et ne devrait donc pas être modifiée ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47). Par conséquent, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire devrait être rejetée.
[44]
Aucune des parties n'a proposé une question de portée générale aux fins de certification.

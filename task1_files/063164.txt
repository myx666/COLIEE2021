 Summary: 
 
 The defendant in a copyright action applied under rule 419(1)(a) to strike the plaintiffs' statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 An Associate Senior Prothonotary of the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, in a judgment reported 62 F.T.R. 318, allowed the application and struck the statement of claim. The plaintiffs appealed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, in a decision reported 69 F.T.R. 39, allowed the appeal and set aside the order striking the statement of claim. The defendant appealed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Appeal, in a decision reported 174 N.R. 34, dismissed the appeal. The defendant filed its statement of defence and counterclaimed for copyright infringement. The plaintiffs applied for an order dismissing the defendant's counterclaim on the basis that it was not commenced within three years of the alleged infringement date (Copyright Act, s. 41).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, allowed the application in part and dismissed the defendant's counterclaim insofar as it concerned non-injunctive relief. The court held that the s. 41 limitation period did not apply to injunctive relief.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 This application was heard in Ottawa, Ontario, on November 12, 1996, by Tremblay-Lamer, J., of the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, who delivered the following judgment on December 2, 1996.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>                                                                                                        <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Tremblay-Lamer, J. 
 : The plaintiffs seek an order dismissing the defendant's counterclaim, by way of an application for summary judgment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 I. The Parties And Their 
 
 Respective Claim  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The plaintiff Milliken & Company (hereinafter  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) is an American corporation organized and carrying on business under the laws of the State of Delaware. The plaintiff Milliken Industries of Canada Ltd. (hereinafter "Milliken Canada") was incorporated and carries on business under the laws of Canada. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the plaintiff Milliken. The defendant Interface Flooring Systems (Canada) Inc. (hereinafter "Interface Canada") was incorporated and carries on business under the laws of Ontario. The defendant is a wholly owned subsidiary of Interface Inc., a United States corporation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The plaintiffs (hereinafter also referred to as the "Milliken companies") commenced an action on December 11, 1992, wherein they allege that the defendant Interface Canada infringed their copyright rights in the "Mangrove Design", in supplying and installing carpet tiles of a certain design at the Calgary International Airport. They seek injunctive relief, damages and relief as provided for in s. 38 of the  
 Copyright Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42 (hereinafter the " 
 Act 
 ").  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  The plaintiff Milliken is the owner of the copyright in the published artistic work entitled "Mangrove". The artistic work was created by Claire Iles as author in about September 1988, under the title "Harmonie". In January 1989, Claire Iles sold and assigned her rights in the artistic work to the plaintiff Milliken. The artistic work was published in the United States by the plaintiff Milliken on May 23, 1989 under the name "Mangrove" as a textile design for carpet tiles. Copyright in the artistic work was registered in the Canadian Copyright Office on November 12, 1992.   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  The defendant's counterclaim relates to the supply and installation of carpet tiles at Gulf Canada Square, an office building in downtown Calgary. Interface Canada's claim is for infringement of copyright in the "Interface Design" of which they are the exclusive licensee. The relief sought by Interface Canada is threefold. They seek the issuance of an injunction restricting the plaintiffs from infringing the copyright, damages and s. 38 relief.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  Interface Canada is the exclusive Canadian licensee of the published artistic work known as the "Interface Design". This artistic work was created by employees of Interface Inc., on or around December 1988, based on a conceptual sketch prepared by Hayashi & Associates Interior Design Limited.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II. Background And Interlocutory 
 
 Proceedings Before This Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  There is a conflict between the parties' evidence regarding when the Milliken companies' activities at the Gulf Canada Square occurred. While the plaintiffs argue the activities occurred and ended in July 1989, (affidavit of Jim Davidson, paragraphs 13 to 15) Interface Canada maintains that there were three installations: an upper concourse installation in August 1989, an installation in the 18 elevator cabs some time in early 1990, and an installation in the walk-off areas adjacent to the interior entrances on the ground floor in the spring or summer of 1990 (affidavit of Jeffrey K. Casselman, paragraphs 6 and 7). Notwithstanding the different evidence of the parties, it is conceded that the plaintiffs' activities ended no later than the summer of 1990.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  With respect to the Calgary International Airport project, in February 1991, the defendant tendered and obtained a first contract to supply and install an initial three thousand square yards of carpet tiles. In September 1992, Interface Canada tendered and obtained a contract to supply and install a further two thousand square yards of carpet tiles.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  The Milliken parties initially raised the issue of alleged copyright infringement for the carpet tile supplied by Interface Canada for the Calgary International Airport by a demand letter dated April 13, 1992. On May 27, 1992, Interface Canada responded to this letter and raised the issue of the infringing activities of the Milliken companies with respect to the Gulf Canada Square.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  On October 14, 1992 counsel for Interface Canada made a settlement offer to the Milliken companies which proposed that the issues relating to the Calgary International Airport and Gulf Canada Square projects be resolved on the basis that Interface Canada would agree not to supply the carpet tiles at issue at the Calgary International Airport to any customer other than Transport Canada, provided that the Milliken companies agree they would not supply the carpeting at issue at Gulf Canada Square to any customer other than Gulf Canada Square (affidavit of Jeffrey K. Casselman, paragraph 16, and Exhibit 9).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  The Milliken companies did not answer this proposal. On December 11, 1992, they commenced their action for copyright infringement in relation to the carpet tiles supplied to the Calgary International Airport. In early January 1993, Interface Canada moved to strike the Milliken companies' claim on the ground that there was no valid copyright on the facts pleaded. This involved a question of law regarding the interpretation of the english and french versions of the  
 Act 
 . On April 15, 1993, the motion was granted by the Associate Senior Prothonotary. The statement of claim was struck and the action dismissed. The Milliken companies appealed and in October 1993, Strayer, J., (as he then was) set aside the order of the Associate Senior Prothonotary. Interface Canada subsequently appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal and on September 7, 1994, the appeal was dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  On September 22, 1994, Interface Canada filed its statement of defence and counterclaim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III. The Issue  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The plaintiffs seek an order dismissing the defendant's counterclaim on the basis that it was not commenced before the expiration of the three years immediately following the alleged infringement date. As a result, given the wording of s. 41 of the  
 Act 
 , the defendant's counterclaim  
 is 
  statute barred.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV. The Relevant Statutory Provision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Section 41 of the  
 Act 
  reads as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "41. An action in respect of infringement shall not be commenced after the expiration of three years immediately following the infringement. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 V. The Parties' Submissions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 A. The Plaintiffs  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The plaintiffs submit that the Milliken companies' activities at the Gulf Canada Square occurred and ended in July 1989. Interface Canada asserts that installations occurred in three locations: the upper concourse in August 1989, 18 elevator cabs some time in early 1990, and the walk-off areas adjacent to the interior entrances on the ground floor in the spring or summer of 1990. Interface Canada admitted it had actual knowledge of the installation of the carpet tile shortly after it occurred. Should the court conclude that the limitation period specified in s. 41 commenced from the date on which the defendant actually discovered the installation of the carpet tile, the action by counterclaim filed September 22, 1994, was commenced beyond the limitation period.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  The plaintiffs then turn to the estoppel and waiver doctrines. With respect to the waiver doctrine, they submit that they never waived their right to invoke the s. 41 limitation period. Interface Canada failed to establish that the Milliken companies knowingly acted in a manner whereby they waived reliance upon a known right or defect. Interface Canada admits that there was no agreement by the Milliken companies to waive any limitation period. None of the letters from the Milliken companies' solicitors proposed a settlement with respect to the Gulf Canada Square project. The only letter which contained a proposal with respect to the Gulf Canada Square was the letter from the solicitors for Interface Canada dated August 14, 1992. This letter did not require a response and was of no interest to them.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  With respect to commencing an action against the Milliken companies, Interface Canada admits that by either the latter half of 1989 or at very latest, in respect of the walk-off areas, by the spring or summer of 1990, it could have sued for copyright infringement had it chosen to do so. There was nothing to prevent Interface Canada from commencing an action against the Milliken companies concerning the Gulf Canada Square project prior to receiving a demand letter from the Milliken companies' solicitors in April 1992 relating to the Calgary International Airport project.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  With respect to estoppel, the plaintiffs stressed that they did not, by words or conduct, make a promise which was intended to affect their legal relationship and be acted upon. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the defendant relied on such representation. Furthermore, there is no obligation upon the person relying on a statutory limitation period to advise the other party of its strategy in relation to the claim. In support of this argument, counsel invokes the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  &  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.R.(3d) 704 (C.A.).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 B. The Defendant  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  The limitation period in s. 41 of the  
 Act 
  pertains to the right of a plaintiff to be awarded damages and not to injunctive relief. (see  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.)). As a result, the only issue on this motion is whether the plaintiff can demonstrate that the defendant's claim for non-injunctive relief is statute barred.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  With respect to its claim for non-injunctive relief, the defendant relies on the estoppel doctrine. Because of the settlement negotiations, the plaintiffs are estopped from relying on the s. 41 limitation period. Once they entered into settlement negotiations, the plaintiffs had to advise the defendant within a reasonable time if they intended to cease negotiations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  The defendant further argues that the court should be loath to have an action dismissed based on a limitation defence without adjudication on the merits where the other party has been fully aware of the claim and has not been prejudiced by the delay. In support of this proposition, Interface Canada relies on the case of  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Gen. Div.) at p. 94.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  The defendant finally relies on  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), wherein Addy, J., stated, at p. 73:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "There is no doubt that, at law, a counterclaim is in essence a separate action and, generally speaking, is subject to the same rules regarding limitations as any ordinary action. There are, however, some exceptions such as where the main action is instituted at the very last minute and the defendant who had instituted no counterclaim under a mistaken and justifiable belief that the plaintiff was not intending to sue, is by reason of the last minute action of the plaintiff unable to sue within the statutory limitation period. Courts in such a case will normally not enforce limitations where the defendant acts promptly after receiving a notice of the plaintiff's claim, even where the limitation statute is very strict and does not, as in the case of s. 645(2) of the  
 Canada Shipping Act 
 , expressly give the Court the power to extend the limitation. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 VI. The Law  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 A. The Summary Judgment Test  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 193, I considered all of the case law pertaining to summary judgment motions and I summarized the general principles as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "1. the purpose of the provisions is to allow the court to summarily dispense with cases which ought not proceed to trial because there is no genuine issue to be tried ( 
 Old Fish Market Restaurants v. 1000357 Ontario Inc. et al. 
 );  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "2. there is no determinative test ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  case is so doubtful that it does not deserve consideration by the trier of fact at a future trial;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "3. each case should be interpreted in reference to its own contextual framework ( 
 Blyth 
  and  
 Feoso 
 );   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "4. provincial practice rules (especially rule 20 of the Ontario  
 Rules 
 ) can aid in interpretation ( 
 Feoso 
  and  
 Collie 
 ); 
 
    <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 5. this court may determine questions of fact and law on the motion for summary judgment if this can be done on the material before the court (this is broader than rule 20 of the Ontario  
 Rules 
   
 of Civil Procedure 
 ) ( 
 Patrick 
 );  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "6. on the whole of the evidence, summary judgment cannot be granted if the necessary facts cannot be found or if it would be unjust to do so ( 
 Pallman 
  and  
 Sears 
 );   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "7. in the case of a serious issue with respect to credibility, the case should go to trial because the parties should be cross-examined before the trial judge ( 
 Forde 
  and  
 Sears 
 ). The mere existence of apparent conflict in the evidence does not preclude summary judgment; the court should take a 'hard look' at the merits and decide if there are issues of credibility to be resolved ( 
 Stokes 
 );" (citations omitted)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  On a motion for summary judgment, it is for the moving party to establish that the other party's statement of claim, statement of defence or counterclaim discloses no genuine issue to be tried.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 B. The Section 41 Limitation Period  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 a) Injunctive Relief  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  I am of the opinion that the defendant was right in asserting that the s. 41 limitation period has no application with respect to injunctive relief. In  
 Warner Bros. 
 , supra, Cattanach, J., refers to  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Copyright Act 
  which provided that an action would not lie in respect of an infringement of copyright unless it had occurred within three years which immediately precede the issue of the writ, said at p. 229:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 'Moreover, the section does not, in my opinion, apply to an action for an injunction restraining infringements in the future, in which past infringements are evidence of the threat to infringe in the future ...' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [26] 
  The rationale for that rule lies, in my opinion, with the equitable nature of injunctive relief. In claims for injunction or other equitable relief, statutes limiting the time during which actions may be brought should generally be considered inapplicable (See, by analogy, I.C.F. Spry,  
 The Principles of Equitable Remedies 
 , The Law Book Company Ltd., 4th ed., Australia, 1990, at pp. 241 and 242).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 b) Non-injunctive Relief  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  Notwithstanding this, the s. 41 limitation period still prevents a plaintiff from claiming non-injunctive relief if more than three years have lapsed since the alleged infringement date. Certain common law exceptions may, however, prevent a defendant from relying upon a statutory limitation period. Such is the case with the promissory estoppel and waiver doctrines. For promissory estoppel, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant, by words or conduct, made a promise which was intended to affect their legal relationship and to be acted upon. Further, the plaintiff must establish that he actually relied on such representation. For waiver, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant acted in a manner whereby they waived reliance upon a known right or defect.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VII. Discussion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  On a motion for summary judgment the burden lies with the moving party to establish that there is no genuine issue to be tried. Where, the respondent seeks to rely on the doctrines of promissory estoppel or waiver in defence of the application for summary judgment, it bears the proof thereof.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  The facts necessary for disposition of this application are readily apparent from the material before the court. Apart from the evidence concerning the date when the Milliken companies' activities at Gulf Canada Square occurred, which does not in any event affect the outcome of this motion, I find that there is no conflicting evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  It must first be determined whether or not the defendant's counterclaim disclose a genuine issue for trial. For the above-mentioned reasons, I am of the opinion that the claim for injunctive relief does disclose a genuine issue for trial. I however, come to a different conclusion with respect to the claim for non-injunctive relief. The defendant's claim for non-injunctive relief is, in my view, statute barred pursuant to s. 41 of the  
 Act 
 . While it is conceded that the Milliken companies' activities at Gulf Canada Square ended no later than spring or summer 1990 and the defendant had knowledge of those activities shortly after they occurred, it is clear that three years lapsed between that date and the date of the filing of the counterclaim on September 22, 1994.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that the defendant has established the existence of promissory estoppel or waiver. Nothing in the material before me indicates that the Milliken companies actually waived their right to rely on the s. 41 limitation period. In fact, Interface Canada admits that there was no agreement by the Milliken companies to waive any limitation period.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  The defendant submits that as they were involved in settlement negotiations, the Milliken companies are estopped from relying on the s. 41 limitation period. In this regard, I find it sufficient to simply say that none of the letters from the Milliken companies' solicitors proposed a settlement with respect to the Gulf Canada Square project. The plaintiffs are, in my view, correct in their assertion that there is no obligation upon a person relying on a statutory limitation period to advise the other party of its strategy in relation to the other party's claim. The reasoning of the Ontario Court of Appeal in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  716, Osborne, J.A., stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In my view, the respondent was not required to advise the appellant of its strategy in relation to the appellant's claim. It did not breach a duty it owed to the appellant by remaining silent as to its basic position on the coverage issue, while it continued to investigate the cause of the loss. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [33] 
  The defendant relies on the case of  
 The Ship " <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  cannot apply to the facts of the case at bar. It applies where the main action is instituted at the very last minute in order to prevent the defendant from filing its counterclaim within the appropriate time frame. In this case, it cannot be said that the Milliken companies acted so that a counterclaim on the defendant's part would be statute barred pursuant to s. 41 of the  
 Act 
 . While the plaintiffs' activities at Gulf Canada Square ended no later than summer 1990, the plaintiffs filed their claim regarding the Calgary International Airport on December 11, 1992. The defendant's initial response was a motion to strike the claim (cross-examination of Jeffrey K. Casselman on his affidavit, plaintiff's motion record, vol. II, p. 155). The defendant delayed further action pending the disposition of the appeal on the application to strike. In so doing, the defendant acted unreasonably and knowingly and wilfully jeopardized its rights. The plaintiffs cannot be held responsible for such inaction.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  For these reasons I partially grant the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. The defendant's counterclaim is dismissed as statute barred insofar as it concerns non-injunctive relief, with costs against the defendant, Interface Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application allowed in part.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

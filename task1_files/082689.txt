Solicitors of Record:
William F. Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.
Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Kane, J.
: This is an appeal from the Order of Prothonotary Aalto, made on July 2, 2013 which struck out the applicants' Notice of Application without leave to amend on the basis that the application was bereft of any chance of success. The applicant now seeks to set aside the Order and asks this Court to conduct a
de novo
review. The respondent agrees that the appeal should be considered to have been brought pursuant to Rule 51 of the
Federal Courts Rules
.
[2]
As noted in the decision of the Prothonotary, the issues raised by the applicants, which arise out of the search and seizure of certain documents at 660 Eglinton Avenue East by the Canada Revenue Agency ("CRA"), have been the subject of five previous proceedings, all of which were dismissed.
[3]
The respondent noted that Harold Coombs, together with others, has to date commenced a total of 14 applications and two actions against various entities and agencies of the Federal Government.
[4]
On March 12, 2013, the applicants filed T-441-13 seeking declaratory relief from an illegal search and seizure in violation of sections 8 and 15 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
.
[5]
On October 21, 2013, Harold Coombs and Joan Coombs brought an application in this Court (T-1744-13), seeking relief for, among other things, an alleged breach of sections 8 and 15 of the
Charter
and section 231 of the
Income Tax Act
. In T-1744-13, the applicants are also seeking to have documents seized by the CRA returned. By order of Justice Hughes dated November 27, 2013, the application in T-1744-13 was consolidated with T-441-13. The respondent is moving to strike T-1744-13.
[6]
Although the actions have been consolidated, a separate Order has been issued with respect to T-1744-13 and other related recent applications heard together on February 24, 2013.
[7]
In T-1725-13, filed on October 18, 2013, Harold Coombs and Joan Coombs seek to quash a decision of the CRA Appeals Division, which confirmed the reassessment for taxation years between 2001 and 2007 of Select Travel Inc, a company in which Harold Coombs and Joan Coombs are majority shareholders.
[8]
In T-1834-13, filed on November 7, 2013, Oleg Volochkov, Anne Volochkov, John F Coombs and Harold Coombs seek to quash a decision of the CRA Appeals Division, which confirmed the reassessment for certain taxation years between 1997 and 2008 of these individuals and Sun Air Travel Inc., a company in which Harold Coombs is president, sole director and a shareholder.
[9]
By Direction of Prothonotary Aalto, dated February 13, 2014, the applications in T-1725-13 and T-1834-13 were consolidated and directed to be heard at the same time as T-441-13. The applicants argue that T-1725-13 and T-1834-13 are not simply applications to quash the decisions of the CRA Appeals Division but are applications for a
Charter
remedy. The respondent is also moving to strike these applications.
[10]
All of these applications arise from a common set of facts, the details of which have been described in several other Orders of this Court and the Tax Court of Canada [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[11]
The following background will provide a summary for the purpose of the applicants' present appeal of the decision of Prothonotary Aalto.
Background
[12]
The CRA sent a team to conduct a search at 660 Eglinton Avenue East in Toronto on September 20, 2006 pursuant to a search warrant issued under the
Criminal Code
by the Ontario Court of Justice on September 14, 2006 (the "Search Warrant"). The applicants allege and the respondent has acknowledged and the TCC has previously found that one of the members of the team that executed the Search Warrant, John Legros, was not named on the Search Warrant. John Legros assisted in the search and seizure by physically moving boxes. The applicants allege that Mr Legros seized documents that have been unaccounted for in the inventory of documents provided by the CRA. The CRA has provided a full inventory to the applicants. The applicants allege that documents they assert are now missing from their offices are not accounted for in the CRA's inventory, these documents must have been taken by John Legros and that this constitutes an illegal seizure. The CRA's affiant, Lynn Watson, who is the lead investigator and was responsible for the search of the applicants' premises, has attested that all of the documents seized were transported to the offices of the CRA and all were accounted for in the inventory.
[13]
With respect to the Search Warrant, it is noted that on April 16, 2007, Harold Coombs launched an application (T-742-07) in this Court seeking to quash the Search Warrant and to regain possession of all the documents and property seized at 660 Eglinton Avenue East. On June 18, 2007, Prothonotary Aalto struck T-742-07 on the basis that the Court has no jurisdiction to set aside the Search Warrant or to order the return of any materials seized pursuant to it.
[14]
On or about March 30, 2009, Mr Justice Gans of the Superior Court of Justice issued an Order instructing the CRA to retain the seized documents until such time as "the appeal period for any civil tax court proceedings" expired. On October 10, 2013, the CRA sent a letter to Harold Coombs advising him that it would, in the near future, make an application to the Superior Court of Justice for an Order to return the seized documents. This letter includes an inventory of the seized documents and the name of the person who seized each individual item.
[15]
At the hearing on February 24, 2014 of T- 441-13, T-1744-13, T-1725-13 and T-1834-13, Mr Coombs acknowledged that the CRA had made efforts to have the documents returned to him through the appropriate Court proceedings. However, he indicated that this would only result in the return of documents noted on the CRA inventory and not the documents he alleges are missing and, therefore, he was not interested in having the inventoried documents returned.
[16]
On March 12, 2013, the applicants commenced the application  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -13, now the subject of the current appeal, seeking relief from the "illegal search and seizure" conducted on September 20, 2006 on the grounds that "John Gargos", who was not named on the Search Warrant, had seized documents on that day. The applicants allege that the search violated their section 8 and 15 rights under the
Canadian Charter
and that a remedy should be provided under section 24 of the
Charter
. The applicants also sought a declaration from this Court to have appeals heard on common evidence.
[17]
On June 18, 2013, the respondent moved to strike T-441-13. On July 2, 2013, Prothonotary Aalto struck T-441-13 on the basis that the application is bereft of success and that the application amounts to an abuse of process, being frivolous and vexatious.
The decision - Prothonotary Aalto's Order
[18]
The Prothonotary summarized the relief requested as follows:
This application seeks declaratory relief arising from an alleged illegal search and seizure that was conducted by officials of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) which it is alleged by the Applicants amounted to a denial of fundamental justice at a Tax Court of Canada (TCC) hearing in 2008. Specifically, the relief sought is that the appeals heard in the TCC being Nos. 2005-3602 (IT), 2005-3623 (IT) and 2005-4191 (IT) were a violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Charter).
[19]
The Prothonotary summarized the applicant's argument, which is the same argument and theory advanced at the hearing on February 24, 2014.That argument is that: the search was executed illegally because an unnamed person participated in the search and that documents now missing are not accounted for on the inventory provided by the CRA; as such, the only possible conclusion is that the unaccounted for documents were taken by the unnamed person, "John Gagros". The Prothonotary noted that the applicants had pursued complaints to the CRA.
[20]
The Prothonotary cited the TCC's judgment in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DTC 4004 [
Coombs TCC
]:
[104] During that hearing, the judge indicated that there are court procedures available for the production of documents that would be available for the appellants who had appeals then under the general procedure. It was also mentioned by counsel for the Crown that procedures are in place under the Criminal Code to obtain the documents. The appellants had ample time to deal with this issue prior to the trial and they chose not to.
[21]
The Prothonotary also noted that the TCC's decision was appealed and that the Court of Appeal cited approvingly the above passage, before dismissing the appeal for delay (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 361, [
Coombs FCA
]).
[22]
The Prothonotary considered the applicants' argument that this application is different because subsection 24(1) of the
Charter
is invoked, but concluded that this argument is futile because the propriety of the Search Warrant and its execution have been determined in prior Court proceedings, whereas subsection 24(1) of the
Charter
is a remedial provision in play only if there is a breach of
Charter
rights.
[23]
The Prothonotary remarked that, in effect, the applicants' claim amounts to a collateral attack on the 2008 decision of the TTC, which falls outside the jurisdiction of this Court. The Prothonotary concluded that this application is bereft of any chance of success, is vexatious and frivolous, and amounts to an abuse of process:
Mr. Coombs says that this matter is different because section 24(1) of the Charter is invoked and the other two Applicants were not party to the prior applications. Section 24(1) of the Charter does not help the Applicants. That section deals with remedies for a breach of Charter rights. The issue of the propriety of the search warrants and their execution has been determined in prior Court proceedings. This application is simply a variation on a well-worn theme.
In effect, part of the relief sought in the notice of application is a collateral attack on the decision of the TCC from 2008. That decision was appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal and dismissed. There is no jurisdiction in this Court to review the TCC decision in question.
The issues relating to the search warrants have previously been dealt with and this notice of application amounts to an abuse of process and is a frivolous and vexatious application. The application must be dismissed
. In coming to this conclusion, I have reviewed carefully the Applicants' motion record and the Applicants' written submissions. However, they are not persuasive. There is ample authority as outlined in the written representations of the Respondent as to why this application is bereft of any chance of success and must be dismissed.
[Emphasis added]
The Applicants' Position
[24]
The applicants submit that the Order which struck out their application for judicial review should be set aside because it concerned questions that are vital to the case and was based upon a wrong principle or a misapprehension of the facts (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) [
Aqua-Gem
]).
[25]
The applicants argue that the Prothonotary erred in law and failed to consider that the language of subsection 24(1) of the
Charter
is broad enough to include the remedy of damages for breach of their rights (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Ward
]). As such, the applicants submit that the Prothonotary erred by finding that subsection 24(1) of the
Charter
has no application. The applicant also submits that the TCC does not have jurisdiction to grant the remedy sought in this application and therefore the Federal Court should assume this jurisdiction.
[26]
The applicants further submit that the Prothonotary exceeded his jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 50(1)(f) of the
Federal Courts Rules
by deciding issues that concern section 7 of the
Charter,
involving their life, liberty, and security of the person. The applicants submit that their allegations and evidence clearly establish that their life, liberty, and security were at risk. Although the applicants acknowledge that their liberty may no longer be at risk, because no criminal proceedings have been instituted, they argue that their liberty has been put at risk by the uncertainty in the status of the possible criminal proceedings and the delay in receiving information about who participated in the search.
[27]
The applicants also submit that the Prothonotary erred in law by relying on the Affidavit of Maria Vojnovic, because no evidence should be led on a motion to strike a notice of application (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 226).
[28]
The applicants argue that motions to strike an application for judicial review should be resorted to only in the most exceptional circumstances, since justice is better served by allowing the application judge to deal with all the issues that are raised, given that a judicial review application proceeds in much the same way a motion to strike a notice of application would proceed, i.e. on affidavit evidence and arguments before a judge (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) [
David Bull
];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 236 [
Amnesty].
The applicants argue that no exceptional circumstances exist in the present circumstances to warrant striking out their application at this stage.
The Respondent's Position
[29]
In response to the applicant's argument that the Prothonotary exceeded his jurisdiction by making an order "relating to the liberty of a person", contrary to Rule 50(1)(f) of the
Federal Courts Rules
, the respondent submits that the applicants' motion did not fall within any of the exceptions enumerated in Rule 50(1). Therefore, Prothonotary Aalto acted within his jurisdiction in making the Order striking out the application.
[30]
The respondent further submits that there is no basis to set aside or vary the Prothonotary's Order under Rule 399, which provides a party with an opportunity to move to set aside or vary an Order made
ex parte
. In this case, the respondent notes that the motion was determined in writing, with both parties having filed materials.
[31]
The respondent agreed, despite that the applicants had not referred to the appropriate rule, that Rule 51 should be relied on to appeal the Prothonotary's Order.
[32]
The respondent submits that the Prothonotary's decision was not based on a wrong principle of law or a misapprehension of facts. The respondent submits that the Prothonotary correctly determined that the applicants are, in effect, seeking declaratory relief that they were denied fundamental justice at the TCC, which amounts to a collateral attack on the conclusions of the TCC, which were upheld by the Court of Appeal. Furthermore, the respondent argues that subsection 24(1) of the
Charter
does not apply in this case, as the propriety of the Search Warrant and its execution have been determined in prior Court proceedings.
[33]
The respondent submits that the Prothonotary has jurisdiction to strike an application for judicial review where such an application is clearly "bereft of any possibility of success" (
David Bull
,
supra
at para 15).
[34]
The respondent notes that this Court has already struck five prior applications brought by Harold Coombs for want of jurisdiction.
The Issues
[35]
The issues are: whether the decision of Prothonotary Aalto should be set aside because he applied the wrong legal test in determining whether to strike the applicant's application for judicial review; and, if the decision is set aside, whether, on a
de novo
review, the Court should dismiss the respondent's motion to strike and order that the application be heard on its merits.
The Standard of Review of a Prothonotary's decision
[36]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) and restated at para 19 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , leave to appeal to SCC refused [2004] SCCA No 80, was reiterated:
It is trite law that discretionary orders of Prothonotaries ought not to be disturbed on appeal to a Judge unless:
(a) they are clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion was based upon a wrong principle or a misapprehension of facts; or
(b) in making them, the prothonotary improperly exercised his or her discretion on a question vital to the final issue of the case.
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 462-463 (F.C.A.)).
[37]
The applicants submit that the questions are vital to the final issue of the case and that the order of the Prothonotary was wrong.
The Prothonotary did not err
[38]
I have considered whether the Order of Prothonotary Aalto is clearly wrong, i.e. whether he exercised his discretion based upon a wrong principle of law or upon a misapprehension of facts.
[39]
Prothonotary Aalto fully considered and understood the applicants' arguments and the premise the applicants relied on to argue that their
Charter
rights were breached. He also applied the correct legal test. The Prothonotary did not err; he did not base his decision on a wrong principle of law nor did he misapprehend the facts.
[40]
Although the question at issue would be vital to the final issue in the case, given that once the application is struck, the matter is concluded, the test requires the Prothonotary to have exercised his discretion improperly. This is not the case.
[41]
The Prothonotary correctly determined that the applicants are, in effect, seeking a declaration they were denied fundamental justice at the TCC, which amounts to a collateral attack on the conclusions of the TCC, which were upheld by the Court of Appeal. In fact, even though a
Charter
breach was not directly in issue in the TCC, Justice Woods  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
at paras 101-106, nevertheless considered allegations concerning the propriety of the Search Warrant and its execution:
101 Before concluding these reasons, I wish to make a comment about a procedural issue raised by Mr. Coombs in argument.
102 The procedural issue has to do with a seizure of records in the course of a criminal investigation against a number of individuals, including Harold Coombs, in September of 2006. Mr. Coombs argues that the seizure has caused prejudice to the appellants in reference to these appeals because they have not had the necessary documents to properly prepare their cases.
103 I do not think that the appellants can complain of unfairness in this regard. I would note that this issue was raised in a case management hearing before Justice Bowie on July 30, 2007.
104
During that hearing, the judge indicated that there are court procedures available for the production of documents that would be available for the appellants who had appeals then under the general procedure. It was also mentioned by counsel for the Crown that procedures are in place under the Criminal Code to obtain the documents. The appellants had ample time to deal with this issue prior to the trial and they chose not to.
105 Mr. Coombs argued that these steps would not have been fruitful because it appeared that some of the documents are no longer in the Crown's possession.
Mr. Coombs' theory is that they were likely taken by a CRA official who, according to Mr. Coombs, illegally participated in the search and seizure. First, I note that this is an unproven allegation on which there is not a sufficient evidentiary basis to support it. I reject any notion that an official from the CRA is hiding documents in this case.
106
I am also not satisfied that the seizure was illegal even if someone not named in the warrant was invited to participate by the officer in charge. In this regard, I note the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[Emphasis added.]
[42]
This very same passage was cited by the Court of Appeal in dismissing the appeal due to delays (
Coombs  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
at para 10).
[43]
The Prothonotary was therefore justified in reaching the conclusion that he did, namely, "the issues relating to the search warrants have previously been dealt with and this notice of application amounts to an abuse of process and is a frivolous and vexatious application ..." and that "there is ample authority as outlined in the written representations of the Respondent as to why this application is bereft of any chance of success and must be dismissed."
[44]
Although the applicants contend that in the earlier proceedings they did not seek relief pursuant to section 24 of the
Charter
for breaches of their section 8 and 15 rights (the applicant also referred to a breach of section 7), the circumstances that the applicants rely on in these allegations are the very same circumstances considered by the TCC. The allegations of
Charter
breaches all stem from the allegations regarding the search and seizure of documents. Justice Woods clearly rejected the bald allegations that an official of CRA is hiding documents. In addition, Justice Woods noted that the Supreme Court of Canada had established in
R v Strachan
, [1988] 2 SCR 980, 56 DLR (4th) 673 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] that the participation of a person not named in the search warrant does not invalidate the warrant or its execution. These are the very same allegations and, whether characterized as a
Charter
breach or otherwise, the issues have been previously determined.
[45]
The applicants' argument that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> should be distinguished because in that case, the officer in charge of the search attempted to seek judicial authorization by advising the judge that two other officers would participate, does not change the fact that the Supreme Court of Canada clearly indicated at para 29:
This requirement is met when the officer or officers named in the warrant execute it personally and are responsible for the control and conduct of the search. The use of unnamed assistants in the search does not violate the requirement of s. 10(2) so long as they are closely supervised by the named officer or officers. It is the named officers who must set out the general course of the search and direct the conduct of any assistants. If the named officers are truly in control, participate in the search, and are present throughout, then the use of assistants does not invalidate the search or the warrant.
[46]
The Court did not put any additional caveats on this general proposition.
[47]
The Prothonotary did not err in permitting the respondent to submit the affidavit of Maria Vojnovic. This affidavit merely put the previous decisions and orders of this Court, the TCC and the Federal Court of Appeal, all of which are matters of public record, before the Prothonotary.
[48]
The Prothonotary acted within his jurisdiction as conferred by Rule 50 of the
Federal Courts Rules
. Rule 50 provides that a Prothonotary may make any necessary orders relating to a motion, except, among other circumstances, in a motion relating to the liberty of a person. While the applicants have alleged a breach of section 7 of the
Charter
and an infringement of their life, liberty and security of the person, the Prothonotary's decision was not related to the applicants' liberty, but whether the applicant's matter was bereft of success because it has already been dealt with by the TCC and the Court of Appeal. In this case, the applicants' bare allegations that their liberty is at stake, or was previously at stake, in light of a previous finding of the TCC that the search was not illegal and the allegations were bald, do not oust the Prothonotary of his jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 50.
[49]
Although motions to strike an application for judicial review should not be made except in the most exceptional circumstances, I disagree with the applicants that no such exceptional circumstances exist in the present case. The circumstances are indeed exceptional given the multiplicity of proceedings brought by the applicants all arising from the same set of facts, all with various nuances in an attempt to package the applications as new and different. These circumstances clearly justify the exercise of the Prothonotary's discretion to strike the application. The applicant relied on
Amnesty
in which Justice Mactavish summarized the principles governing motions to strike. Those principles are not in dispute and were applied correctly by the Prothonotary. It is true that different considerations are at play when considering whether to strike out a Notice of Application for Judicial review than a statement of claim.
[50]
In
Amnesty
,
supra
at paras 26-27, Justice Mactavish noted:
[26] As a result, the Federal Court of Appeal determined that applications for judicial review should not be struck out prior to a hearing on the merits of the application, unless the application is "so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success".
[27] The Federal Court of Appeal further teaches that "Such cases must be very exceptional and cannot include cases ... where there is simply a debatable issue as to the adequacy of the allegations in the notice of motion":
David Bull
, at ¶15.
[51]
The Prothonotary reached the conclusion that the merits of the application were "so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success".
[52]
With respect to the applicants' argument that they are entitled to approach this Court for a remedy pursuant to section 24 of the
Charter
, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Ward,
I note that the applicants do not appear to appreciate that a remedy pursuant to section 24 must be based on a breach of a
Charter
right. Although the applicants assert that their applications differ from earlier applications because they now allege breach of
Charter
rights, as noted above, the applicants rely on the very same facts to support the alleged
Charter
breach that were found by the Tax Court of Canada to not constitute an illegal search. The Prothonotary addressed this issue and noted:
Mr. Coombs says that this matter is different because section 24(1) of the Charter is invoked and the other two Applicants were not party to the prior applications. Section 24(1) of the Charter does not help the Applicants. That section deals with remedies for a breach of Charter rights. The issue of the propriety of the search warrants and their execution has been determined in prior Court proceedings. This application is simply a variation on a well-worn theme.
[53]
The applicants have not established that the decision of the Prothonotary should be set aside. Moreover, the applicants have made the same arguments before me as they made before Prothonotary Aalto and, in so doing, had yet another opportunity to raise the same issues, just as if they had a
de novo
review. If I had concluded that the Prothonotary erred, which I have not, and had conducted a
de novo
review, I would arrive at the same conclusion: that the application is an abuse of process and must be dismissed. Despite the applicants' commitment to pursuing every possible option, repackaging or re-characterizing the same application time and time again with the same allegations that have previously been adjudicated upon will not open up new avenues of relief or yield a different result.
[54]
The application is dismissed.

.........................
Harold Coombs, Joan  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  l'appel de l'ordonnance, datée du 2 juillet 2013, par laquelle le protonotaire Aalto a radié l'avis de demande des demandeurs sans permission de la modifier, au motif que la demande n'avait aucune chance d'être accueillie. Les demandeurs cherchent maintenant à faire annuler l'ordonnance et demandent à la Cour de procéder à un examen
de novo
de l'affaire. Le défendeur est d'accord pour dire que l'appel devrait être considéré comme ayant été introduit en vertu de l'article 51 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
.
[2]
Ainsi que le protonotaire l'a fait observer dans sa décision, les questions qui ont été soulevées par les demandeurs et qui font suite à une perquisition au cours de laquelle certains documents ont été saisis au 660, avenue Eglinton Est, par l'Agence du Revenu du Canada (l'ARC) ont déjà fait l'objet de cinq instances différentes qui se sont toutes soldées par un rejet.
[3]
Le défendeur signale qu'avec d'autres personnes, Harold Coombs a jusqu'ici introduit en tout 14 demandes et deux actions contre divers entités et organismes du gouvernement fédéral.
[4]
Le 12 mars 2013, les demandeurs ont, dans le dossier T-441-13, sollicité un jugement visant à faire déclarer illégales, en vertu des articles 8 et 15 de la
Charte canadienne des droits et libertés
, la perquisition et la saisie dont ils avaient fait l'objet.
[5]
Le 21 octobre 2013, Harold Coombs et Joan Coombs ont saisi la Cour d'une demande (T-1744-13) visant à obtenir notamment une réparation pour la violation alléguée des articles 8 et 15 de la
Charte
et de l'article 231 de la
Loi de l'impôt sur le revenu.
Dans le dossier T-1744-13, les demandeurs réclament également la restitution des documents saisis par l'ARC. Aux termes de l'ordonnance prononcée le 27 novembre 2013 par le juge Hughes, la demande T-1744-13 a été réunie à la demande T-441-13. Le défendeur a présenté une requête en vue de faire radier la demande T-1744-13.
[6]
Bien que les actions aient été réunies, une ordonnance distincte a été rendue relativement au dossier T-1744-13 et à d'autres demandes récentes connexes entendus ensemble le 24 février 2013.
[7]
Dans l'instance T-1725-13, introduite le 18 octobre 2013, Harold Coombs et Joan Coombs cherchent à faire annuler la décision par laquelle la Direction générale des appels de l'ARC a confirmé la nouvelle cotisation établie pour les années d'imposition comprise entre 2001 et 2007 relativement à Select Travel Inc, une société dont Harold Coombs et Joan Coombs sont les actionnaires majoritaires.
[8]
Dans l'instance T-1834-13, introduite le 7 novembre 2013, Oleg Volochkov, Anne Volochkov, John F Coombs et Harold Coombs cherchent à faire annuler une décision par laquelle la Direction générale des appels de l'ARC a confirmé la nouvelle cotisation établie pour certaines années d'imposition comprises entre 1997 et 2008 des particuliers en question et de Sun Air Travel Inc., une société dont Harold Coombs est le président, l'unique administrateur et un des actionnaires.
[9]
Aux termes de la directive donnée le 13 février 2014, le protonotaire Aalto a réuni les demandes T-1725-13 et T-1834-13 et a ordonné qu'elles soient entendues en même temps que la demande T-441-13. Les demandeurs affirment que les dossiers T-1725-13 et T-1834-13 ne sont pas simplement des demandes visant à faire annuler les décisions rendues par la Direction générale des appels de l'ARC, mais qu'elles visent à obtenir une réparation au titre de la
Charte
. Le défendeur a également présenté une requête visant à faire radier ces demandes.
[10]
Toutes les demandes en question découlent de la même série de faits, dont les détails ont déjà été exposés dans diverses ordonnances prononcées par la présente cour et par la Cour canadienne de l'impôt (la CCI).
[11]
Le contexte qui suit résume l'objet du présent appel interjeté par les demandeurs à l'encontre de la décision du protonotaire Aalto.
Le contexte
[12]
L'ARC a dépêché une équipe chargée de mener une perquisition au 660, avenue Eglinton Est, à Toronto, le 20 septembre 2006, conformément à un mandat de perquisition décerné en vertu du
Code criminel
par la Cour de justice de l'Ontario le 14 septembre 2006 (le mandat de perquisition). Les demandeurs allèguent, le défendeur a reconnu et la CCI a déjà conclu que le nom d'un des membres de l'équipe qui a exécuté le mandat de perquisition, John Legros, ne figurait pas sur le mandat de perquisition. John Legros a aidé à l'exécution de la perquisition et de la saisie en transportant des boîtes. Les demandeurs allèguent que M. Legros a saisi des documents qui ne figuraient pas dans l'inventaire des documents fournis par l'ARC. L'ARC a remis aux demandeurs un inventaire détaillé. Les demandeurs allèguent que les documents, qui, selon ce qu'ils prétendent, ne se trouvent plus dans leurs bureaux, ne sont pas mentionnés dans l'inventaire de l'ARC, que ces documents doivent avoir été pris par M. John Legros et qu'il s'agit par conséquent d'une saisie illégale. L'auteure de l'affidavit de l'ARC, Lynn Watson, qui était l'enquêtrice principale chargée de la perquisition des locaux des demandeurs, a attesté que tous les documents saisis avaient été transportés dans les bureaux de l'ARC et qu'ils figuraient tous dans l'inventaire.
[13]
En ce qui concerne le mandat de perquisition, il y a lieu de signaler que, le 16 avril 2007, Harold Coombs a introduit une demande (T-742-07) cherchant à faire annuler par la présente cour le mandat de perquisition et de récupérer tous les documents et biens qui avaient été saisis au 660, avenue Eglinton Est. Le 18 juin 2007, le protonotaire Aalto a radié la demande T-742-07, au motif que la Cour n'avait pas compétence pour annuler le mandat de perquisition ou pour ordonner la restitution des pièces et documents saisis aux termes de celui-ci.
[14]
Le ou vers le 30 mars 2009, le juge Gans de la Cour supérieure de justice a prononcé une ordonnance enjoignant à l'ARC de retenir les documents saisis [traduction] « jusqu'à l'expiration de tout délai d'appel relatif à toute instance introduite devant une juridiction fiscale civile ». Le 10 octobre 2013, l'ARC a adressé à Harold Coombs une lettre l'informant qu'elle s'apprêtait à demander à la Cour supérieure de justice une ordonnance de restitution des documents saisis. Cette lettre comprend un inventaire des documents saisis ainsi que le nom de la personne ayant saisi chaque article.
[15]
À l'audience du 24 février 2014, relativement aux dossiers T- 441-13, T-1744-13, T-1725-13 et T-1834-13, M. Coombs a reconnu que l'ARC avait effectivement fait des efforts pour que les documents lui soient restitués en introduisant les instances judiciaires appropriées. Il a toutefois ajouté qu'il ne récupérerait que les documents mentionnés dans l'inventaire de l'ARC, et non ceux qui, selon ce qu'il affirme, sont manquants et que, par conséquent, il n'était pas intéressé à ce que les documents figurant dans l'inventaire lui soient restitués.
[16]
Le 12 mars 2013, les demandeurs ont introduit l'instance T-441-13, qui fait l'objet du présent appel, dans laquelle ils sollicitent l'annulation [traduction] « de la perquisition et de la saisie illégales » menées le 20 septembre 2006, au motif que John Gargos, qui n'était pas nommé dans le mandat de perquisition, avait saisi des documents ce jour-là. Les demandeurs allèguent que la perquisition viole les droits que leur reconnaissent les articles 8 et 15 de la
Charte
canadienne et que le tribunal devrait leur accorder une réparation au titre de l'article 24 de la
Charte.
Les demandeurs demandent aussi à la présente cour qu'elle ordonne que les appels soient entendus sur preuve commune.
[17]
Le 18 juin 2013, le défendeur a présenté une requête en vue de faire radier la demande T-441-13. Le 2 juillet 2013, le protonotaire Aalto a radié la demande T-441-13, au motif que la demande n'avait aucune chance d'être accueillie, qu'elle constituait un abus de procédure et qu'elle était futile et vexatoire.
La décision - l'ordonnance du protonotaire Aalto
[18]
Voici comment le protonotaire résume les réparations sollicitées:
[traduction]
La présente demande cherche à obtenir un jugement déclaratoire à la suite d'une perquisition et d'une saisie prétendues illégales qui ont été menées par des représentants de l'Agence du revenu du Canada (l'ARC) qui, selon ce qu'allèguent les demandeurs, constituaient un déni de justice fondamentale lors de l'audience tenue par la Cour canadienne de l'impôt (la CCI) en 2008. Plus précisément, les demandeurs allèguent que les appels entendus par la CCI dans les dossiers 2005-3602 (IT), 2005-3623 (IT) et 2005-4191 (IT) constituaient une violation de la Charte des droits et libertés (la Charte).
[19]
Le protonotaire a résumé l'argumentation des demandeurs, qui est identique aux arguments et à la thèse formulés à l'audience du 24 février 2014. Cette argumentation est la suivante: la perquisition était illégale, parce qu'une personne qui n'était pas nommée dans le mandat a participé à la perquisition et que des documents qui ont depuis disparu ne figurent pas dans l'inventaire fourni par l'ARC; la seule conclusion possible est donc que des documents qui ne figurent pas dans l'inventaire ont été pris par John Gagros, la personne qui n'était pas nommée. Le protonotaire a signalé que les demandeurs avaient porté plainte à l'ARC.
[20]
Le protonotaire a cité la décision rendue par la CCI dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DTC 4004, au paragraphe 104 (
Coombs CCI
):
[104] Durant cette audience, le juge Bowie a indiqué qu'il existait des procédures judiciaires permettant aux appelants dont les appels étaient alors régis par la procédure générale d'obtenir des documents. L'avocate de la Couronne a aussi mentionné que le Code criminel permettait d'obtenir des documents. Les appelants avaient amplement de temps pour régler cette question avant le procès, et ils ont choisi de ne pas le faire.
[21]
Le protonotaire a également fait observer que la décision de la CCI avait été portée en appel et que la Cour d'appel avait cité et approuvé le passage précité avant de rejeter l'appel pour cause de retard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 361, au paragraphe 10 (
Coombs CAF
)).
[22]
Le protonotaire a examiné l'argument des demandeurs suivant lequel la présente demande était différente, étant donné que le paragraphe 24(1) de la
Charte
y était invoqué. Le protonotaire a toutefois conclu que cet argument était vain, parce que le bien-fondé du mandat de perquisition et de son exécution avait déjà été tranché par la Cour dans des instances antérieures, tandis que le paragraphe 24(1) de la
Charte
est une disposition réparatrice qui n'entre en jeu que s'il y a eu violation de droits garantis par la Charte.
[23]
Le protonotaire a fait remarquer que la prétention des demandeurs équivalait en fait à une attaque indirecte de la décision rendue en 2008 par la CCI, ce qui déborde le cadre de la compétence de la présente cour. Le protonotaire a conclu que la demande en l'espèce n'avait aucune chance d'être accueillie, qu'elle était vexatoire et futile et qu'elle équivalait à un abus de procédure:
[traduction]
M. Coombs affirme que la présente affaire est différente, étant donné que le paragraphe 24(1) de la Charte est invoqué et que les deux autres demandeurs n'étaient pas partie aux demandes antérieures. Le paragraphe 24(1) de la Charte n'est d'aucune utilité pour les demandeurs. Cette disposition porte sur les réparations qui peuvent être accordées en cas de violation de droits garantis par la Charte. La question du bien-fondé des mandats de perquisition et de leur exécution a déjà été tranchée par la Cour dans d'autres instances. La présente demande est simplement une variation sur un thème bien connu.
Une partie de la réparation sollicitée dans l'avis de demande constitue en fait une attaque indirecte de la décision de 2008 de la CCI. Or, cette décision a été portée en appel devant la Cour d'appel fédérale, qui l'a rejetée. La présente cour n'a pas compétence pour examiner la décision en question de la CCI.
Les questions portant sur les mandats de perquisition ont déjà été examinées, et le présent avis de demande constitue un abus de procédure et un recours futile et vexatoire. La demande doit être rejetée.
Pour en arriver à cette conclusion, j'ai examiné attentivement le dossier de requête des demandeurs ainsi que leurs arguments écrits. Ils ne sont cependant pas convaincants. Ainsi que le défendeur l'a souligné dans ses observations écrites, il existe de nombreux précédents qui confirment la raison pour laquelle la présente demande n'a aucune chance d'être accueillie et doit être rejetée.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
La thèse des demandeurs
[24]
Les demandeurs affirment que l'ordonnance par laquelle leur demande de contrôle judiciaire a été radiée devrait être annulée, parce qu'elle concernait des questions qui revêtaient une importance cruciale quant à l'issue de l'affaire et qu'elle était fondée sur un principe erroné ou sur une mauvaise appréciation des faits (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) (
Aqua-Gem
)).
[25]
Les demandeurs affirment que le protonotaire a commis une erreur de droit et qu'il n'a pas tenu compte du fait que le libellé du paragraphe 24(1) est suffisamment large pour englober des dommages-intérêts pour violation de leurs droits (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (
Ward
)). Les demandeurs affirment donc que le protonotaire a commis une erreur en concluant que le paragraphe 24(1) de la
Charte
ne s'appliquait pas. Les demandeurs affirment également que la CCI n'a pas compétence pour accorder la réparation sollicitée dans la présente demande et que, par conséquent, la Cour fédérale devrait se déclarer compétente à cet égard.
[26]
Les demandeurs affirment également que le protonotaire a outrepassé la compétence que lui confère l'alinéa 50(1)
f
) des
Règles des Cours fédérales
en tranchant des questions qui ont trait à l'article 7 de la
Charte
et portent sur leur droit à la vie, à la liberté et à la sécurité de leur personne. Les demandeurs affirment que leurs allégations et les éléments de preuve qu'ils ont présentés démontrent de façon évidente que leur droit à la vie, à la liberté et à la sécurité de leur personne était compromis. Bien que les demandeurs reconnaissent que leur liberté ne soit plus en danger, étant donné qu'aucune procédure criminelle n'a été engagée, ils soutiennent que leur liberté a été compromise en raison de l'incertitude créée par l'éventualité qu'il y ait des poursuites criminelles et du temps qui s'est écoulé avant qu'ils reçoivent des renseignements au sujet des personnes ayant participé à la perquisition.
[27]
Les demandeurs affirment également que le protonotaire a commis une erreur de droit en se fondant sur l'affidavit de Maria Vojnovic, parce qu'aucun élément de preuve ne doit être présenté à l'appui d'une requête en radiation d'un avis de demande (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 226, au paragraphe 16).
[28]
Les demandeurs affirment que l'on ne doit recourir à une requête en radiation d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire que dans des circonstances tout à fait exceptionnelles, étant donné que la justice est mieux servie si l'on permet au juge chargé d'instruire la demande de traiter de toutes les questions qui sont soulevées, et ce, compte tenu du fait que l'instruction d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire se déroule à peu près de la même façon qu'une requête en radiation d'un avis de demande, c'est-à-dire, en ce sens que la preuve se fait au moyen d'affidavit et que l'argumentation est présentée devant un juge (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) (
David Bull
);
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 236 (
Amnisty
)
.
Les demandeurs affirment qu'il n'existe en l'espèce aucune circonstance exceptionnelle qui justifierait de radier leur demande à cette étape-ci.
La thèse du défendeur
[29]
En réponse à l'argument du demandeur suivant lequel le protonotaire a outrepassé sa compétence en rendant une ordonnance « concernant la mise en liberté ou l'incarcération d'une personne » contrairement à l'alinéa 50(1)
f
) des
Règles des Cours fédérales
, le défendeur affirme que la requête des demandeurs ne tombe sous le coup d'aucune des exceptions énumérées au paragraphe 50(1) des Règles. Par conséquent, le protonotaire Aalto a agi dans les limites de sa compétence en rendant l'ordonnance radiant la demande.
[30]
Le défendeur affirme également que rien ne permet d'annuler ou de modifier l'ordonnance du protonotaire au titre de l'article 399 des Règles, qui permet à une partie de présenter une requête en vue de faire annuler ou modifier une ordonnance rendue sur requête
ex parte
. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, le défendeur signale que la requête a été jugée sur dossier et que les deux parties ont déposé des pièces.
[31]
Malgré le fait que les demandeurs n'ont pas cité la bonne disposition des Règles, le défendeur convient que c'est l'article 51 des Règles qui doit être invoqué pour interjeter appel de l'ordonnance du protonotaire.
[32]
Le défendeur affirme que le protonotaire n'a pas fondé sa décision sur un mauvais principe ou une mauvaise appréciation des faits. Le défendeur soutient que le protonotaire a estimé à bon droit que les demandeurs cherchaient en réalité à obtenir un jugement déclarant qu'ils avaient été victimes d'un déni de justice naturelle de la part de la CCI, ce qui revient à attaquer indirectement les conclusions de la CCI qui ont été confirmées par la Cour d'appel. Le défendeur affirme également que le paragraphe 24(1) de la
Charte
ne s'applique pas en l'espèce, étant donné que le bien-fondé du mandat de perquisition et de son exécution a déjà été jugé dans des instances judiciaires antérieures.
[33]
Le défendeur affirme que le protonotaire a compétence pour radier une demande de contrôle judiciaire, dès lors que cette demande n'a de toute évidence « aucune chance d'être accueillie » (
David Bull
, précité, au paragraphe 15).
[34]
Le défendeur signale que la présente cour a déjà radié cinq demandes présentées par Harold Coombs pour défaut de compétence.
Les questions en litige
[35]
Les questions en litige en l'espèce sont celle de savoir si la décision du protonotaire Aalto devrait être annulée, au motif qu'il n'a pas appliqué le bon critère juridique pour décider s'il y avait lieu de radier la demande de contrôle judiciaire des demandeurs, et, si la décision est annulée, celle de savoir si, dans le cadre d'un examen
de novo
, la Cour devrait rejeter la requête en radiation du défendeur et ordonner l'instruction de la demande sur le fond.
La norme de contrôle de la décision du protonotaire
[36]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), et reprise au paragraphe 19 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (autorisation de pourvoi à la CSC refusée, [2004] SCCA no 80):
Il est bien établi en droit qu'un juge siégeant en appel ne doit pas modifier l'ordonnance discrétionnaire d'un protonotaire, sauf si:
a) l'ordonnance est entachée d'une erreur flagrante, en ce sens que le protonotaire a exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire sur le fondement d'un mauvais principe ou d'une mauvaise appréciation des faits;
b) le protonotaire a mal exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire relativement à une question ayant une influence déterminante sur la décision finale quant au fond.
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 18, qui renvoie à l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.), aux pages 462 et 463.)
[37]
Les demandeurs affirment que les questions en litige ont une influence déterminante sur la décision finale quand au fond et que l'ordonnance du protonotaire était erronée.
Le protonotaire n'a pas commis d'erreur
[38]
Je me suis penchée sur la question de savoir si l'ordonnance du protonotaire Aalto était entachée d'une erreur flagrante, c'est-à-dire s'il avait exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire sur le fondement d'un mauvais principe ou d'une mauvaise appréciation des faits.
[39]
Le protonotaire Aalto a bien examiné et saisi les arguments des demandeurs ainsi que la prémisse sur laquelle les demandeurs se fondaient pour affirmer que les droits qui leur sont garantis par la
Charte
avaient été violés. Il a également appliqué le bon critère juridique. Le protonotaire n'a pas commis d'erreur, et il n'a pas fondé sa décision sur un mauvais principe ou sur une mauvaise appréciation des faits.
[40]
Bien que la question en litige ait eu une influence déterminante sur la décision finale quand au fond, compte tenu du fait que, dès lors que la demande est radiée, le dossier est clos, le critère exige que le protonotaire ait mal exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire. Or, ce n'est pas le cas.
[41]
Le protonotaire a estimé à bon droit que les demandeurs cherchaient en fait à obtenir un jugement déclarant qu'ils avaient été victimes d'un déni de justice naturelle de la part de la CCI, ce qui revient à porter une attaque indirecte contre les conclusions de la CCI, lesquelles ont été confirmées par la Cour d'appel. En fait, bien que la violation de la
Charte
n'ait pas été directement en cause devant la CCI, la juge Woods a néanmoins, dans la décision
Coombs CCI
, précitée, aux paragraphes 101 à 106, examiné des allégations concernant le bien-fondé du mandat de perquisition et de son exécution:
[101] Avant de conclure le prononcé des présents motifs, je tiens à faire une observation quant à une question de procédure soulevée par Harold Coombs lors de sa plaidoirie.
[102] La question de procédure porte sur la saisie de documents, en septembre 2006, dans le cadre d'une enquête criminelle visant plusieurs personnes, dont Harold Coombs. Ce dernier soutient que la saisie était préjudiciable aux appelants, à l'égard des présents appels, parce qu'ils n'avaient pas eu accès aux documents nécessaires à la préparation de leurs appels.
[103] À mon avis, les appelants ne peuvent pas se plaindre d'iniquité à cet égard. Je constate que la question a été soulevée lors de l'audience sur la gestion de l'instance présidée par le juge Bowie le 30 juillet 2007.
[104] Durant cette audience, le juge Bowie a indiqué qu'il existait des procédures judiciaires permettant aux appelants dont les appels étaient alors régis par la procédure générale d'obtenir des documents. L'avocate de la Couronne a aussi mentionné que le Code criminel permettait d'obtenir des documents. Les appelants avaient amplement de temps pour régler cette question avant le procès, et ils ont choisi de ne pas le faire.
[105] Harold Coombs a soutenu que ces mesures n'auraient pas été utiles parce qu'il semblerait que certains des documents ne soient plus entre les mains de la Couronne.
Harold Coombs suppose qu'ils ont été pris par un représentant de l'ARC qui aurait participé illégalement à la perquisition et à la saisie. D'abord, je constate qu'il s'agit là d'une allégation qui n'a pas été confirmée par la preuve présentée en l'espèce. Ensuite, je rejette toute allégation voulant qu'un représentant de l'ARC ait caché des documents dans la présente affaire.
[106]
Je ne suis pas convaincue que la perquisition et la saisie auraient été illégales même si quelqu'un dont le nom n'apparaissait pas sur le mandat de perquisition avait été invité à y participer par la personne responsable. À ce sujet, je note l'existence de la décision de la Cour suprême du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 
.
[Non souligné dans l'original]
[42]
La Cour d'appel a cité le même passage pour rejeter l'appel pour cause de retard (
Coombs CAF
, précité, au paragraphe 10).
[43]
Le protonotaire était donc justifié de tirer la conclusion à laquelle il est arrivé, en l'occurrence [traduction] « [l] es questions portant sur les mandats de perquisition ont déjà été examinées, et le présent avis de demande constitue un abus de procédure et un recours futile et vexatoire [...] » et [traduction] « [a] insi que le défendeur l'a souligné dans ces observations écrites, il existe de nombreux précédents qui confirment la raison pour laquelle la présente demande n'a aucune chance d'être accueillie et doit être rejetée ».
[44]
Bien que les demandeurs affirment que, dans les instances antérieures, ils ne réclamaient pas de réparation fondée sur l'article 24 de la
Charte
pour violation des droits que leur garantissent les articles 8 et 15 - les demandeurs ont également mentionné que l'article 7 avait été violé -, les faits sur lesquels ils se fondent pour formuler ces allégations sont exactement les mêmes que ceux que la CCI a examinées. Les allégations de violation de la
Charte
découlent toutes d'allégations concernant la perquisition et la saisie de documents. La juge Woods a clairement écarté les allégations non étayées suivant lesquelles un fonctionnaire de l'ARC cachait des documents. Qui plus est, la juge Woods a fait observer que, dans l'arrêt
R c Strachan
, [1988] 2 RCS 980, 56 DLR (4th) 673 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), la Cour suprême du Canada avait jugé que le fait qu'une personne non désignée dans le mandat de perquisition avait participé à celle-ci n'avait pas pour effet d'invalider le mandat ou son exécution. On a affaire à exactement les mêmes allégations et, peu importe que l'on affirme qu'il y a eu violation de la
Charte
ou non, ces questions ont déjà été tranchées.
[45]
L'argument des demandeurs suivant lequel il convient d'établir une distinction entre la présente espèce et l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au motif que, dans cette dernière, le fonctionnaire chargé de la perquisition avait tenté d'obtenir une autorisation judiciaire en informant le juge que deux autres agents y participeraient, ne change rien au fait que la Cour suprême du Canada a bien expliqué, au paragraphe 31 de sa décision:
L'exigence est respectée lorsque l'agent ou les agents nommés dans le mandat l'exécutent en personne et sont responsables du contrôle de la perquisition et de la manière dont elle est exécutée. Le recours à des assistants non nommés pour effectuer la perquisition ne viole pas l'exigence que pose le par. 10(2) dans la mesure où ils sont étroitement surveillés par l'agent ou les agents nommés. Ce sont les agents nommés qui doivent établir l'orientation générale de la perquisition et diriger tous les assistants. Si les agents nommés contrôlent vraiment la situation, s'ils participent à la perquisition et sont présents en tout temps, alors le recours à des assistants n'a pas pour effet d'invalider la perquisition ou le mandat.
[46]
La Cour suprême n'a pas apporté d'autres nuances à cette proposition générale.
[47]
Le protonotaire n'a pas commis d'erreur en permettant du défendeur de soumettre l'affidavit de Maria Vojnovic. Cet affidavit a eu simplement pour effet de porter à l'attention du protonotaire les diverses décisions et ordonnances déjà prononcées par la présente cour, la CCI et la Cour d'appel fédérale, qui sont toutes des documents publics.
[48]
Le protonotaire a respecté les limites de la compétence que lui confère l'article 50 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
. L'article 50 prévoit que le protonotaire peut rendre les ordonnances nécessaires en réponse à toute requête sauf, notamment, si la requête concerne la mise en liberté ou l'incarcération d'une personne. Bien que les demandeurs affirment que l'article 7 de la
Charte
a été violé et que l'on a porté atteinte à leur droit à la liberté, à la liberté et à la sécurité de leur personne, la décision du protonotaire ne se rapportait pas à la mise en liberté ou à l'incarcération des demandeurs, mais bien sur la question de savoir si la requête des demandeurs n'avait aucune chance d'être accueillie, étant donné qu'elle avait déjà été jugée par la CCI et la Cour d'appel. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, les allégations non étayées des demandeurs suivant lesquelles leur liberté est en jeu ou a déjà été en jeu, n'a pas pour effet de priver le protonotaire de la compétence que lui confère l'article 50 des Règles, compte tenu de la conclusion antérieure de la CCI suivant laquelle la perquisition n'était pas illégale et suivant laquelle les allégations n'étaient pas étayées.
[49]
Bien que les requêtes en radiation d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire ne devraient être présentées que dans les circonstances les plus exceptionnelles, je ne suis pas d'accord avec les demandeurs pour dire qu'il n'existe pas de telles circonstances exceptionnelles en l'espèce. Les circonstances sont effectivement exceptionnelles, compte tenu de la multiplication des instances introduites par les demandeurs sur le fondement des mêmes faits, à quelque nuance près dans chaque cas, en vue de présenter chaque demande ou requête sous un jour nouveau ou différent. Les circonstances en question justifient nettement l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire du protonotaire de radier la demande. Les demandeurs invoquent la décision
Amnesty
, dans laquelle la juge Mactavish a résumé les principes régissant les requêtes en radiation. Ces principes ne sont pas contestés et le protonotaire les a bien appliqués. Il est vrai que d'autres facteurs sont en jeu lorsqu'on se prononce sur l'opportunité de radier un avis de demande de contrôle judiciaire plutôt qu'une déclaration.
[50] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Amnesty
, précitée, la juge Mactavish écrit ce qui suit, aux paragraphes 26 et 27:
[26] C'est la raison pour laquelle la Cour d'appel fédérale a statué qu'il n'y a pas lieu de radier une demande de contrôle judiciaire avant la tenue de l'audience sur le fond, à moins que la demande soit « manifestement irrégulière au point de n'avoir aucune chance d'être accueillie ».
[27] La Cour d'appel fédérale indique de plus que « [c] es cas doivent demeurer très exceptionnels et ne peuvent inclure des situations [...], où la seule question en litige porte simplement sur la pertinence des allégations de l'avis de requête »:
David Bull
, au paragraphe 15
[51]
Le protonotaire a conclu que la demande était, sur le fond, « manifestement irrégulière au point de n'avoir aucune chance d'être accueillie ».
[52]
En ce qui concerne l'argument des demandeurs suivant lequel ils ont le droit de réclamer à la présente cour une réparation au titre de l'article 24 de la
Charte
, conformément à l'arrêt
Ward
de la Cour suprême du Canada, je tiens à signaler que les demandeurs ne semblent pas comprendre que les réparations prévues à l'article 24 doivent être fondées sur une violation d'un droit garanti par la
Charte
. Bien que les demandeurs affirment que leur demande diffère de leur demande antérieure, parce qu'ils invoquent maintenant une violation de leurs droits garantis par la
Charte
, je rappelle que les demandeurs se fondent, à l'appui de leur moyen tiré de la violation alléguée de la
Charte
, sur exactement les mêmes faits que ceux sur lesquels la Cour canadienne de l'impôt s'est fondée pour conclure qu'il n'y avait pas lieu de conclure à l'existence d'une perquisition illégale. Le protonotaire a abordé la question et a déclaré ce qui suit:
[traduction]
M. Coombs affirme que la présente affaire est différente, étant donné que le paragraphe 24(1) de la Charte est invoqué et que les deux autres demandeurs n'étaient pas partie aux demandes antérieures. Le paragraphe 24(1) de la Charte n'est d'aucune utilité pour les demandeurs. Cette disposition porte sur les réparations qui peuvent être accordées en cas de violation des droits garantis par la Charte. La question du bien-fondé des mandats de perquisition et de leur exécution a déjà été tranchée par la Cour dans d'autres instances. La présente demande est simplement une variation sur un thème bien connu.
[53]
Les demandeurs n'ont pas démontré que la décision du protonotaire devait être annulée. De plus, les demandeurs nous ont soumis exactement les mêmes arguments que ceux qu'ils avaient invoqués devant le protonotaire Aalto et, en ce faisant, ont profité d'une occasion de plus de soulever les mêmes questions, comme si la Cour examinait l'affaire de novo. Si j'avais conclu que le protonotaire avait commis une erreur - ce qui n'est pas le cas - et si j'avais procédé à un examen de novo, j'en arriverais à la même conclusion: la présente demande constitue un abus de procédure et elle doit être rejetée. Bien que les demandeurs s'acharnent à explorer toutes les avenues possibles, à présenter ou à qualifier de diverses façons la même demande encore et encore, en formulant des allégations qui ont déjà été jugées, cette façon de procéder ne leur ouvre aucune nouvelle voie de recours et ne leur permet pas d'obtenir un résultat différent.
[54]
La demande est rejetée.
ORDONNANCE
[55]
LA COUR ORDONNE que
la demande soit rejetée.

Bédard, J.
[Translation]: Before me is a motion under section 51 of the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106 (the Rules), to appeal an order rendered on December 21, 2012, by Richard Morneau, Prothonotary, who ordered to strike, without leave to amend, the declaration filed by the applicant and the dismissal of his action.
I -
Background
[2]
The applicant is a former detainee who served a two-year sentence of incarceration. On October 17, 2012, he brought against the respondent an action in damages for $5,000,000. The statement of claim referred to various decisions made against the applicant when he was incarcerated and for which he is claiming various damages. The allegations in the statement of claim may be summarized as follows:
a. The applicant argued that he was given a medium security classification although he should have been given a minimum security classification; he requested a remedy of $48,600;
b. The applicant alleged that he was denied parole when it should have been granted; he requested a remedy of $24,300;
c. The applicant alleged that the NPB (we presume that the applicant is referring to the Parole Board of Canada) [Translation] "is not a true administrative tribunal as it should be"; he requested a remedy of $100,000;
d. The applicant alleged that the NPB imposed a residency condition on him; he requested a remedy of $124,300;
e. The applicant stated that an unpleasant occurrence took place during which his liberty was jeopardized on uncorroborated hearsay and that during the habeas corpus proceeding, documents were hidden from him despite a disclosure order. The applicant added that an out-of-court agreement was made, but that the respondent did not respect it; he requested a remedy of $2,060,000 for obstructing justice and going through the holidays detained without valid reasons;
f. The applicant argued that the Federal Court found in his favour but that the respondent disobeyed the judgment; he requested a remedy of $1,000,000;
g. The applicant alleged that, in reprisal for his success, Yves Michaud, the respondent's officer, intimidated him and had him arbitrarily imprisoned; he requested a remedy of $1,015,000 and an order requiring the respondent to [Translation] "assist the applicant to obtain a criminal conviction against Mr. Michaud";
h. The applicant alleged that, during his incarceration, the [Translation] "OCI, despite its role of "policing" the CSC, was nonchalant and went so far as to throw oil on the fire"; he requested a remedy of $100,000 and the dissolution of the agency;
i. The applicant alleged that during his incarceration, he never had access to a [Translation] "true system of efficient and expeditious complaints and grievances without fear of reprisal, as the Act requires"; he requested a remedy of $500,000 and the abolition of the current grievance system;
j. The applicant alleged that during his entire incarceration, he was a victim of discrimination on the basis of his age, sex and race; he requested a remedy of $300,000.
[3]
The respondent filed a motion to strike the statement of claim and to dismiss the action by the applicant under section 221 of the Rules, stating that the claim failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action, that it was not relevant, that it was scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and that it constituted an abuse of process.
[4]
The respondent filed his motion under section 369 of the Rules, asking the Court to deal with the motion on the basis of written submissions.
[5]
In his reply to the motion to strike, the applicant requested that the motion be heard as part of a hearing [Translation] "given the seriousness of the remedy sought". However, Mr. Morneau a found that he could dispose of the motion on the basis of the parties' written representations and that it was not necessary to schedule a hearing.
II.
Order by Mr. Morneau
[6]
The substance of the reasons of the order by Mr. Morneau is found in the following excerpt:
[Translation]
CONSIDERING
that a review of the previously noted files and a review of the applicant's statement of claim leads this Court clearly to the same analysis findings as the respondent and specifically to the following findings that the respondent argues at paragraphs 1 to 3 of his written representations, and even if the applicant is representing himself, since it is not his first time before this Court:
i. The applicant's statement of claim is only a construct of assertions and allegations completely devoid of meaning and material facts to support an action in civil liability against the respondent.
ii. The disjointed nature of the allegations in this case and their lack of detail impose on the respondent an insurmountable burden and require that the Court play the largest guessing game as to the nature of the allegations against the respondent, the nature of the alleged damages and the causal link between the two.
iii. In short, the statement of claim is totally flawed and even with the most magnanimous review possible, the applicant's action does not raise any reasonable cause of action in compensation for damages. This action should be dismissed for all the reasons set out in section 221(1)(
a
)(
b
)(
c
)(
f
) of the
Federal Courts Rules
without leave to amend.
CONSIDERING
that the statements of the Quebec Court of Appeal that the respondent quotes at paragraph 16 of its reply submitted on December 18, 2012, unfortunately applies to the applicant (see also the recent statements by this Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et seq.);
CONSIDERING
, accordingly, that it is clear and evident that the applicant's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action, is outrageous, frivolous, vexatious and constitutes an abuse of process within the meaning of paragraphs 221(1)(
a
),(
b
)(
c
) and (
f
) of the Rules and that it deserves to be stricken without leave to amend;
[7]
It should be noted that in his reply to the motion to strike, the applicant argued that his statement of claim should not be stricken. In paragraph 29 of his written submissions, he further raised as an alternative, the following question: [Translation] "If the statement of claim was proven to be flawed, would there be a less drastic remedy than the dismissal of the motion?" However, the applicant did not say how he could correct the deficiencies in his statement of claim nor did he submit an amended draft statement of claim.
III.
Issue
[8]
This motion raises a single genuine issue: Does the order issued by Mr. Morneau contain an error that warrants the intervention of this Court?
IV.
Standard of review
[9]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal explained that the applicable standard of review for discretionary orders of prothonotaries was the following:
17 This Court, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA), set out the standard of review to be applied to discretionary orders of prothonotaries in the following terms:
...
Where such discretionary orders are clearly wrong in that the prothonotary has fallen into error of law (a concept in which I include a discretion based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts),
or where they raise questions vital to the final issue of the case, a judge ought to exercise his own discretion de novo
.
(MacGuigan J., at pages 462 and 463)
[Emphasis added]
...
19 ... The test would now read:
Discretionary orders of prothonotaries ought not be disturbed on appeal to a judge unless:
a) the questions raised in the motion are vital to the final issue of the case, or
b) the orders are clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion by the prothonotary was based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts.
[10]
Before applying these tests, the issue arises as to whether Mr. Morneau's order was discretionary.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 336, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that a decision that allows or dismisses a motion to strike is a discretionary decision. Although in this matter the motion to strike had been decided by a judge, the same principle applies when the motion was decided by a prothonotary (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 64).
[11]
Since Mr. Morneau's discretionary order terminated the action brought by the applicant, it is clear that the questions in the order are "vital to the final issue of the case" and that, accordingly, I must exercise my own discretion and review the motion
de novo
.
V.
Submissions of the parties
A. Applicant's arguments
[12]
In support of his appeal, the applicant raises the following arguments:
a. He criticizes Mr. Morneau for not holding a hearing and for not giving him a fair and equitable opportunity to be heard;
b. He argues that if the statement of claim lacked details, the prothonotary should have issued an order under section 181(2) and not dismissed the action;
c. He argues that he should have [Translation] "at least an opportunity to correct his statement of claim, if the court had found it flawed to the highest degree". The applicant further attached an amended draft statement of claim as an appendix to his motion in appeal;
d. The prothonotary should have taken into consideration that the action is brought under the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
according to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (
City
)
v Ward
, 2010 SCC 27, [2010] 2 SCR 28, and not a traditional action and that, accordingly, the criteria of civil liability such as fault and causation do not apply. The applicant adds that the harm is the infringement of rights protected by the Charter and that his only obligation is to prove [Translation] "that there was a violation of
Charter
rights".
B.
Respondent's submissions
[13]
The respondent argued essentially that the applicant's appeal is without merit because, although the respondent may argue that his action was brought under the Charter, he must support his action with facts. Moreover, the applicant did not submit any facts to support his action.
VI.
Analysis
[14]
The applicant made several criticisms of Mr. Morneau, in part for not calling a hearing to allow him to make his arguments orally.
[15]
This criticism is without merit. Subsection 369(4) of the Rules provides that, when a party to motion requests a hearing, the Court may dispose of the motion in writing or fix a date for a hearing of the motion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4th) 274, the Court of Appeal addressed the Court's discretion to determine whether it is justified to fix a hearing when a respondent to a motion under Rule 369 asks for a hearing:
12
I do not agree. Rule 369 imposes no express limits on the exercise of the Court's discretion to dispose of a motion under Rule 369 in writing or after an oral hearing. Neither the text of the Rule nor the jurisprudence supports the position that motions to dismiss an appeal may not be determined on the basis of written submissions. Rather, the Court exercises its discretion by asking whether, in all the circumstances of the given case, it can fairly dispose of the motion without the delay and additional expense of an oral hearing.
13
The questions in dispute on this motion are purely legal and, in my opinion, not unduly complex. None of the factors listed by Prothonotary Hargrave in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 10, as warranting an oral hearing is present here.
[16]
In this case, I find that it was entirely appropriate of Mr. Morneau to dispose of the motion to strike based on the parties' written submissions. In any event, the applicant had the opportunity to present his arguments orally during the hearing of his motion to appeal the order of Mr. Morneau.
[17]
As to the substantive issue, I recently had to consider the criteria for disposing of a motion to strike a pleading and action in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (available on CanLII) and I take the liberty of quoting the following passage where I restated the main applicable principles:
8
Rule 221(1) of the Rules provides that the Court may strike a pleading if it "discloses no reasonable cause of action". The stringent test for striking out a Statement of Claim on that basis is whether, taking the facts as pleaded, it is "plain and obvious" that the action discloses no reasonable cause of action. This test was reiterated by the Supreme Court in
R v Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.,
2011 SCC 42 at para 17, [2011] 3 SCR 45, where Justice McLachlin stressed that "[w]here a reasonable prospect of success exists, the matter should be allowed to proceed to trial".
9
The Court also insisted, at paragraph 22, that the claimant must clearly plead the facts supporting the claim:
... It is incumbent on the claimant to clearly plead the facts upon which it relies in making its claim. A claimant is not entitled to rely on the possibility that new facts may turn up as the case progresses. The claimant may not be in a position to prove the facts pleaded at the time of the motion. It may only hope to be able to prove them. But plead them it must. The facts pleaded are the firm basis upon which the possibility of success of the claim must be evaluated. If they are not pleaded, the exercise cannot be properly conducted.
10
It is also well established that the Court must read the pleading generously with a view to accommodating drafting deficiencies (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on QL) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ),
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII)). This, however, does not exempt the claimant from pleading the material facts supporting the claim. Bare assertions and conclusions are not sufficient.
11
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 15, Justice Snider, summarized as follows this requisite:
The jurisprudence also establishes that a statement of claim does not disclose a cause of action where it contains bare assertions, but no facts on which to base those assertions (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)). Moreover, a conclusion of law pleaded without the requisite factual underpinning to support the legal conclusions asserted is defective, and may be struck out as an abuse of Court (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 1321).
[18]
In my view, even in with a generous reading of the statement of claim, the applicant's action has no chance of success and I endorse the comments made by Mr. Morneau in his order. I would add that the statement of claim is composed of a series of allegations and conclusions that are in no way supported by facts. In addition, it contains allegations that are vague, terse and imprecise. Moreover, some claims against the Correctional Service of Canada, the Parole Board of Canada and other undetermined persons. Whether the action brought is based on the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
or on offences committed by representatives of the respondent, the applicant has the obligation, in his statement of claim, to argue the relevant facts in support of his allegations, which he did not do. This requirement is clearly set out in section 174 of the Rules, which requires that a pleading contain a concise statement of the material facts.
[19]
Besides that the statement of claim does not meet the requirements of section 174, I am also of the view that it contains too few facts to allow the Court to administer the matter and allow the respondent to defend himself (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 445;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII)).
[20]
In sum, I consider that the statement of claim does not contain any facts that, if proven, would help find that the fundamental rights of the applicant were violated or that offences were committed and would justify the remedies sought.
[21]
Should the applicant be authorized to amend his statement of claim to correct the deficiencies?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 374, the Federal Court of Appeal considered the circumstances justifying that a party be authorized to amend a faulty pleading to prevent its outright rejection:
8
Motions to strike are governed by Rule 221 of the Federal Courts Rules which provides that a pleading may be struck out with or without leave to amend. For such a motion to succeed it must be plain and obvious or beyond reasonable doubt that the action cannot succeed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.C.A.), cited by the Supreme Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) cited by the Supreme Court in Hunt Carey Canada Inc. at paragraphs 23 and 24.
...
14
After determining that a pleading will be struck, Rule 221 requires consideration of whether a pleading is struck with or without leave to amend.
15
It is not plain and obvious that if amended Mr. Simon's claim that the Canada Revenue Agency erred in its treatment of monies he was otherwise entitled to would not disclose a reasonable cause of action. Therefore, the Federal Court erred in striking the statement of claim without leave to amend.
[Emphasis added]
[See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 23.]
[22]
In this case, I find that Prothonotary Morneau was right to strike the applicant's statement of claim and action without leave to amend his statement of claim since it contains deficiencies too numerous and significant, including a number of allegations and conclusions, to be corrected by an amendment. Further, and as previously noted, the applicant failed to produce an amended draft statement of claim in support of his response to the motion to dismiss the action or indicate how he could amend his statement of claim to correct the deficiencies.
[23]
However, the applicant submitted, in an appendix to his motion to appeal, an amended statement of claim. Thus, I must determine whether I should consider this amended draft statement of claim submitted as part of this appeal.
[24]
It is well established that the evidence submitted to the prothonotary is admissible in an appeal
de novo
of a prothonotary's decision. The authoritative judgment in this matter is
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 424 (
James River Corp
), where Justice Reed wrote at paragraphs 31 to 33:
As I understand counsel's explanation of the Associate Senior Prothonotary's decision, it is that the order requested was refused because there was no proper evidence before the Associate Senior Prothonotary demonstrating that the United States proceeding existed and was parallel to the present proceeding, nor was there evidence demonstrating that the documentation that was sought was relevant to the present proceeding. It was not argued that this decision by the Associate Senior Prothonotary was in error. Counsel for the plaintiff sought to file with the Court an affidavit to supply the missing evidence. He took the position that an appeal of a prothonotary's decision to a judge is a proceeding de novo and, therefore, I was entitled to accept this evidence and render the decision the Associate Senior Prothonotary would have made had he had that evidence before him.
I do not interpret the role of a judge on an appeal of a prothonotary's order in that way. Whatever may be the difference, if any, between the Chief Justice's description on page 454 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  contemplates that the judge will exercise his or her discretion de novo, on the material that was before the prothonotary, and not engage in a hearing de novo based on new materials.
Counsel for the defendant notes that an appeal from an order of a prothonotary is required by the
Federal Court Rules
to be commenced by an "application" (Rule 336(5)), and that an application to the Court is to be made by a motion (Rule 319(1)). A motion is commenced by a notice of motion, not a notice of appeal, and is to be supported by an affidavit setting out "all the facts on which the motion is based that do not appear from the record" (Rule 319(2)). Despite this seeming ambiguity in the
Federal Court Rules
, I understand the procedure established thereby to be, as noted above, an appeal based on the material that was before the prothonotary. This is consistent with the decisions in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII) (available in English only), Justice Gauthier cited
James River Corp
, above, and explained in which circumstances new evidence may be considered:
I must next deal with the defendant's objection to the filing of new evidence. As mentioned earlier, the plaintiffs filed new evidence15 which according to them proves that the misconduct of the defendants is ongoing, torturous, conspirational and criminal and speaks to matters that are pertinent to the jurisdiction of the Court. According to Mr. Carten's representations at the hearing, most of this information came into his possession or deals with events that took place after the date set up by Prothonotary Lafrenière for the filing of his evidence.
...
Generally, an appeal of a Prothonotary's Order is to be decided based on what was before that decision maker; no new evidence is admitted
;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.).
Exceptionally, new evidence may be admissible in circumstances where: it could not have been made available earlier; it will serve the interests of justice; it will assist the Court; and it will not seriously prejudice the other side
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 12;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
As mentioned, I reviewed the new evidence to assess whether it could have any impact whatsoever on the merits of this appeal. I have concluded that it does not. I am thus persuaded that it is not in the interests of justice and would not assist the Court to admit any of this evidence at this stage. This is not one of the exceptional cases referred to above.
[Emphasis added.]
[See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 174;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 1]
[26]
Although in this case the applicant does not seek to introduce new evidence but rather proposes to amend his original statement of claim, I find that the principles established on the introduction of additional evidence are applicable. The judge who hears an appeal from a prothonotary's decision of a right to exercise his discretion in light of the actual file before the prothonotary. The appeal must not be used as an opportunity for a party to improve his case and I do not find, in this case, the elements that would justify making an exception to the rule.
[27]
First, the applicant has not alleged that he was prevented from submitting his amended statement of claim within the response that he filed against the motion to strike. Second, I do not believe that it is in the interest of justice to consider this amended statement of claim since, in any case, it does not adequately correct the numerous deficiencies in the original statement of claim submitted by the applicant. The amended statement of claim is essentially affected by the same defects as the original statement of claim. The applicant provided some additional information with respect to his placement in a medium security institution, the original refusal of his request for an outing during the holidays, the refusal of his parole application, his residency condition and non-disclosure of documents relating to his suspension, among other things. However, the amended statement of claim is just as disjointed as the first-it is still impossible to determine for whom certain claims are intended and the statement of claim as a whole lacks factual details to support the allegations and conclusions they contain.
[28]
For all of these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[29]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
the motion to appeal from the order of Prothonotary Morneau dated December 21, 2012, is dismissed with costs to the respondent.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  appel, en vertu de la règle 51 des
Règles des cours fédérales
, DORS/98-106 (les Règles), d'une ordonnance rendue le 21 décembre 2012 par Me Richard Morneau, Protonotaire, au terme de laquelle il a ordonné la radiation, sans possibilité d'amendement, de la déclaration déposée par le demandeur ainsi que le rejet de l'action intentée par ce dernier.
I.
Contexte
[2]
Le demandeur est un ex-détenu qui a purgé une peine d'incarcération de deux ans. Le 17 octobre 2012, il a intenté contre la défenderesse une action en dommages-intérêts pour un montant de 5 000 000 $. La déclaration fait état de diverses décisions prises à l'endroit du demandeur, alors qu'il était incarcéré, et pour lesquelles il réclame divers dommages. Les allégués de la déclaration peuvent se résumer comme suit:
a. Le demandeur soutient qu'on lui a attribué une cote de sécurité moyenne alors qu'on aurait dû lui attribuer une cote de sécurité minimale; il demande une réparation de 48 600 $;
b. Le demandeur allègue qu'une libération conditionnelle lui a été refusée alors qu'elle aurait dû lui être accordée; il demande une réparation de 24 300 $;
c. Le demandeur allègue que la CNLC (nous présumons que le demandeur renvoie à la Commission des libérations conditionnelles du Canada) « n'est pas un véritable tribunal administratif comme il se devrait »; il demande une réparation de 100 000 $;
d. Le demandeur allègue que la CNLC lui a imposé une condition d'assignation à résidence; il demande une réparation de 124 300 $;
e. Le demandeur déclare qu'un événement fâcheux est survenu au cours duquel sa liberté a été compromise sur la base de ouï-dire non corroboré et que durant la procédure d'habeas corpus, des documents lui ont été cachés malgré une ordonnance de divulgation. Le demandeur ajoute qu'une entente hors cour est survenue, mais que la défenderesse ne l'a pas respectée; il demande une réparation de 2 060 000 $ pour entrave à la justice et pour avoir passé les fêtes détenu sans motifs valables;
f. Le demandeur soutient que la Cour fédérale lui a donné gain de cause mais que la défenderesse a désobéi au jugement; il demande une réparation de 1 000 000 $;
g. Le demandeur allègue qu'en représailles pour avoir eu gain de cause, Yves Michaud, agent de la défenderesse, l'a intimidé et l'a fait emprisonner arbitrairement; il demande une réparation de 1 015 000 $ ainsi qu'une ordonnance enjoignant à la défenderesse d' « assister le demandeur à obtenir une condamnation criminelle contre M. Michaud »;
h. Le demandeur allègue que, durant son incarcération, le « BEC, malgré son rôle de "policier" auprès du SCC, resta non-chalent [
sic
], et alla même jusqu'à jeter de l'huile sur le feu »; il demande une réparation de 100 000$ et l'abolition de l'organisme;
i. Le demandeur allègue que durant son incarcération, il n'a jamais eu accès à un « véritable système de plaintes et griefs efficace et expéditif sans craintes de représailles, comme l'exige la Loi »; il demande une réparation de 500 000 $ et l'abolition du système de grief actuel;
j. Le demandeur allègue que durant toute son incarcération, il a été victime de discrimination sur la base de son âge, de son sexe et de sa race; il demande une réparation de 300 000 $.
[3]
La défenderesse a déposé une requête en radiation de la déclaration et en rejet de l'action intentée par le demandeur en vertu de la règle 221 des Règles, invoquant que la déclaration ne révélait aucune cause d'action, qu'elle n'était pas pertinente, qu'elle était scandaleuse, frivole et vexatoire et qu'elle constituait un abus de procédure.
[4]
La défenderesse a déposé sa requête en vertu de la règle 369 des Règles, demandant à la Cour de traiter la requête sur la base de prétentions écrites.
[5]
Dans son dossier de réponse à la requête en radiation, le demandeur a demandé que la requête soit entendue dans le cadre d'une audition « compte tenu de la gravité du remède recherché ». Me Morneau a toutefois jugé qu'il pouvait trancher la requête sur la base des représentations écrites des parties et qu'il n'était pas nécessaire de fixer une audition.
II.
L'ordonnance de Me Morneau
[6]
L'essentiel des motifs de l'ordonnance rendue par Me Morneau se retrouve dans l'extrait suivant:
VU
qu'une lecture des dossiers mentionnés précédemment ainsi qu'une lecture de la déclaration d'action du demandeur amène cette Cour clairement aux mêmes conclusions d'analyse que la défenderesse et plus spécialement aux conclusions suivantes que fait valoir la défenderesse aux paragraphes 1 à 3 de ses représentations écrites, et ce, même si le demandeur se représente seul puisque ce dernier n'en n'est pas à ses premières démarches devant cette Cour:
i. La déclaration du demandeur n'est qu'un montage d'assertions et d'allégations complètement vide de sens et de faits matériels pour supporter un recours en responsabilité civile contre la défenderesse.
ii. Le caractère décousu des allégations en cause, et de leur pauvreté en détails, imposent à la défenderesse un fardeau insurmontable, et requiert de la Cour le plus grand exercice de devinette quant à la nature des fautes reprochées à la défenderesse, quant à la nature des dommages allégués, et quant au lien de causalité entre les deux.
iii. Bref, la déclaration est totalement viciée et même avec une lecture la plus magnanime possible, l'action du demandeur ne relève aucune cause raisonnable d'action en réparation d'un dommage. Cette action devrait être rejetée pour les motifs énoncés à la Règle 221 (1)a)b)c)f) des
Règles des cours fédérales
sans possibilité d'amendements.
VU
que les propos de la Cour d'appel du Québec que cite la défenderesse au paragraphe 16 de sa réplique déposée le 18 décembre 2012 s'applique malheureusement au demandeur (voir également les propos tenus récemment par notre Cour dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et ss);
VU
, en conséquence, qu'il est clair et évident que la déclaration d'action du demandeur ne révèle aucune cause d'action valable, est scandaleuse, frivole, vexatoire et constitue un abus de procédure au sens des alinéas 221(1)
a
),
b
)
c
) et
f
) des règles et qu'elle mérite d'être radiée sans possibilité d'amendement;
[7]
Il est à noter que dans son dossier de réponse à la requête en radiation, le demandeur a soutenu que sa déclaration ne devrait pas être radiée. Au paragraphe 29 de ses prétentions écrites, il a par ailleurs soulevé, à titre subsidiaire, la question suivante: « Si la déclaration s'avérait viciée, y aurait-il un remède moins draconien que le rejet de l'action? ». Le demandeur n'a toutefois pas indiqué de quelle façon il pourrait corriger les lacunes de sa déclaration ni produit de projet de déclaration amendée.
III.
Question en litige
[8]
La présente requête soulève une seule véritable question: l'ordonnance rendue par Me Morneau est-elle entachée d'une erreur qui justifie l'intervention de la Cour?
IV.
La norme de contrôle
[9]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour d'appel fédérale a précisé que la norme de contrôle applicable à l'égard des ordonnances discrétionnaires des protonotaires était la suivante:
17
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), la Cour énonce dans les termes suivants la norme de contrôle applicable aux ordonnances discrétionnaires des protonotaires:
[...]
Si l'ordonnance discrétionnaire est manifestement erronée parce que le protonotaire a commis une erreur de droit (concept qui, à mon avis, embrasse aussi la décision discrétionnaire fondée sur un mauvais principe ou sur une mauvaise appréciation des faits)
ou si elle porte sur des questions ayant une influence déterminante sur l'issue du principal, le juge saisi du recours doit exercer son propre pouvoir discrétionnaire en reprenant l'affaire depuis le début
.
[juge MacGuigan, aux pages 462 et 463] [Je souligne.]
[...]
19
[...] J'énoncerais le critère comme suit:
Le juge saisi de l'appel contre l'ordonnance discrétionnaire d'un protonotaire ne doit pas intervenir sauf dans les deux cas suivants:
a) l'ordonnance porte sur des questions ayant une influence déterminante sur l'issue du principal,
b) l'ordonnance est entachée d'erreur flagrante, en ce sens que le protonotaire a exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire en vertu d'un mauvais principe ou d'une mauvaise appréciation des faits.
[10]
Avant d'appliquer ces critères, il convient de déterminer si l'ordonnance rendue par Me Morneau en était une qui relevait de son pouvoir discrétionnaire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 336, la Cour d'appel fédérale a énoncé qu'une décision qui accueille ou rejette une requête en radiation est une décision de nature discrétionnaire. Bien que dans cette affaire la requête en radiation avait été tranchée par un juge, le même principe s'applique lorsque la requête a été tranchée par un protonotaire (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 64).
[11]
Comme l'ordonnance discrétionnaire de Me Morneau a mis un terme final à l'action intentée par le demandeur, il est clair que son ordonnance portait sur une question « ayant une influence déterminante sur l'issue du principal » et que dès lors, je dois exercer mon propre pouvoir discrétionnaire et trancher la requête
de novo
.
V.
Prétentions des parties
A.
Prétentions du demandeur
[12]
Au soutien de son appel, le demandeur invoque les arguments suivants:
a. Il reproche à Me Morneau de ne pas avoir tenu une audience et de ne pas lui avoir accordé une occasion juste et équitable de se faire entendre;
b. Il soutient que si la déclaration manquait de précision, le protonotaire aurait dû rendre une ordonnance en vertu de la règle 181(2) et non rejeter l'action;
c. Il soutient qu'il devrait avoir « minimalement une opportunité de corriger sa déclaration, si la cour devait la juger défficiente [
sic
] au plus haut point ». Le demandeur a d'ailleurs joint un projet de déclaration amendée en annexe de sa requête en appel;
d. Le protonotaire aurait dû prendre en considération que l'action intentée est une action fondée sur la
Charte canadienne des droits et libertés
selon l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , et non une action classique, et que, dès lors, les critères de la responsabilité civile tels que la faute et la causalité ne s'appliquent pas. Le demandeur ajoute que le préjudice est l'atteinte aux droits protégés par la Charte et que sa seule obligation est de prouver « qu'il y a eu violation de droits garantis par la
Charte
. »
B.
Prétentions du défendeur
[13]
Le défendeur soutient essentiellement que l'appel du demandeur est sans fondement puisque, bien que le défendeur soutienne avoir intenté une action fondée sur la Charte, il doit justifier son action par des faits. Or, le demandeur n'a présenté aucun fait pour justifier son action.
VI.
Analyse
[14]
Le demandeur formule plusieurs reproches à l'endroit de Me Morneau, notamment de ne pas avoir convoqué une audition pour lui permettre de faire valoir ses arguments oralement.
[15]
Ce reproche est sans fondement. L'alinéa (4) de la règle 369 des Règles prévoit que, lorsque la partie intimée à une requête demande une audition, la Cour peut statuer sur la requête par écrit ou fixer une date pour l'audition de la requête.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4th) 274, la Cour d'appel a traité de la discrétion dont dispose la Cour pour déterminer s'il est justifié de fixer une audience lorsque la partie intimée à une requête déposée en vertu de la règle 369 demande une audition:
12
Je ne suis pas de cet avis. L'article 369 des Règles n'impose aucune restriction explicite au pouvoir discrétionnaire de la Cour de statuer sur une requête après une audience ou sur la base de prétentions écrites. Ni le libellé de cette disposition ni la jurisprudence n'empêchent que les requêtes visant à faire rejeter un appel soient tranchées sur la base de prétentions écrites. En fait, la Cour exerce son pouvoir discrétionnaire en se demandant si, dans les circonstances d'une affaire donnée, elle peut disposer de la requête de manière équitable sans le coût additionnel d'une audience et le retard qu'elle entraîne.
13
Les questions en litige en l'espèce sont purement juridiques et, à mon avis, ne sont pas excessivement complexes. Aucun des facteurs qui, selon le protonotaire Hargrave dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 10, justifient la tenue d'une audience n'existe en l'espèce.
[16]
En l'espèce, j'estime qu'il était tout à fait approprié de la part de Me Morneau de trancher la requête en radiation sur la base de représentations écrites des parties. À tout événement, le demandeur a eu l'occasion de présenter ses arguments oralement lors de l'audition de sa requête en appel de l'ordonnance de Me Morneau.
[17]
Quant à la question de fond, j'ai eu récemment à me pencher sur les critères applicables aux fins de trancher une requête en radiation de procédure et d'action dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (disponible sur CanLII), et je me permets de citer le passage suivant où j'ai repris les principaux principes applicables:
8
Le paragraphe 221(1) des Règles prévoit que la Cour peut radier un acte de procédure s'il "ne révèle aucune cause d'action [...] valable". Le critère rigoureux à remplir en l'occurrence consiste à déterminer si, compte tenu des faits plaidés, il est "évident et manifeste" que l'action ne révèle aucune cause d'action valable. Ce critère a été entériné par la Cour suprême dans l'arrêt
R c Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltée
, 2011 CSC 42, par 17, [2011] 3 RCS 45, où la juge McLachlin insiste sur le fait que "la demande doit n'avoir aucune possibilité raisonnable d'être accueillie. Sinon, il faut lui laisser suivre son cours".
9
Au paragraphe 22, la Cour souligne également que le demandeur doit clairement plaider les faits sur lesquels il appuie sa demande:
[...] Il incombe au demandeur de plaider clairement les faits sur lesquels il fonde sa demande. Un demandeur ne peut compter sur la possibilité que de nouveaux faits apparaissent au fur et à mesure que l'instruction progresse. Il peut arriver que le demandeur ne soit pas en mesure de prouver les faits plaidés au moment de la requête. Il peut seulement espérer qu'il sera en mesure de les prouver. Il doit cependant les plaider. Les faits allégués sont le fondement solide en fonction duquel doit être évaluée la possibilité que la demande soit accueillie. S'ils ne sont pas allégués, l'exercice ne peut pas être exécuté adéquatement.
10
Il est également bien établi que la Cour doit interpréter l'acte de procédure de manière généreuse, en restant conciliante à l'égard des lacunes de rédaction (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ],
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII)). Cependant, cela ne dispense pas le demandeur de plaider les faits importants sur lesquels la demande est fondée. Il ne suffit pas d'avancer de simples affirmations ou conclusions.
11
Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 15, la juge Snider résumait ainsi cette exigence:
[TRADUCTION] La jurisprudence établit aussi qu'une déclaration contenant de simples affirmations, mais ne faisant état d'aucun fait susceptible de les étayer, ne révèle aucune cause d'action (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)). De plus, la conclusion de droit qui n'est pas appuyée par les faits requis est viciée et peut être radiée au motif qu'elle constitue un abus de procédure (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] A.C.F. no 1321).
[18]
À mon avis, même en faisant une lecture généreuse de la déclaration, l'action intentée par le demandeur n'a aucune chance de succès et j'endosse les propos émis par Me Morneau dans son ordonnance. J'ajouterais que la déclaration est composée d'une série d'allégations et de conclusions qui ne sont aucunement supportées par des faits. De plus, elle contient des allégations qui sont vagues, laconiques et imprécises. Au surplus, certaines réclamations visent le Service correctionnel du Canada, d'autre la Commission des libérations conditionnelles du Canada, et d'autres, des personnes non déterminées. Que le recours intenté soit fondé sur la
Charte canadienne des droits et libertés
ou sur des délits commis par des représentants de la défenderesse, le demandeur a l'obligation, dans sa déclaration, de plaider les faits pertinents au soutien de ses allégations, ce qu'il n'a pas fait. Cette exigence est clairement établie à la règle 174 des Règles qui exige qu'un acte de procédure contienne un exposé concis des faits substantiels.
[19]
Outre que la déclaration ne respecte pas les exigences de la règle 174, je suis également d'avis qu'elle contient trop peu de faits pour permettre à la Cour de gérer l'affaire et pour permettre à la défenderesse d'assurer sa défense (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 445;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 14 (disponible sur CanLII)).
[20]
En somme, je considère que la déclaration ne contient pas de faits qui, s'ils étaient prouvés, permettraient de conclure que les droits fondamentaux du demandeur ont été violés ou que des délits ont été commis et qui justifieraient les mesures de réparations recherchées.
[21]
Le demandeur devrait-il par ailleurs être autorisé à amender sa déclaration pour y corriger les déficiences?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 374, la Cour d'appel fédérale s'est penchée sur les circonstances justifiant qu'une partie soit autorisée à amender une procédure jugée défaillante pour éviter son rejet pur et simple:
8
Les requêtes en radiation sont régies par l'article 221 des Règles des Cours fédérales, lequel prévoit qu'un acte de procédure peut être radié avec ou sans autorisation de le modifier. Pour qu'une telle requête soit accueillie, il doit être évident et manifeste ou hors de tout doute raisonnable que l'action n'a aucune chance d'être accueillie.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A. C.-B.), cité par la Cour suprême dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), cité par la Cour suprême
dans Hunt Carey Canada Inc
., aux paragraphes 23 et 24.
[...]
14
Après avoir ordonné la radiation d'un acte de procédure, le tribunal doit déterminer si ledit acte sera radié avec ou sans autorisation de le modifier conformément à l'article 221.
15
Il n'est pas évident et manifeste que si elle est modifiée, la déclaration de M. Simon selon laquelle l'Agence du revenu du Canada a commis une erreur dans sa façon de traiter l'argent auquel il avait autrement droit ne révélerait pas une cause d'action valable. Par conséquent, la Cour fédérale a commis une erreur en ordonnant la radiation de la déclaration sans autorisation de la modifier. [Je souligne]
[Voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 23.]
[22]
En l'espèce, j'estime que le protonotaire Morneau a eu raison de radier la déclaration et l'action du demandeur sans lui donner la possibilité d'amender sa déclaration puisque celle-ci, qui comprend un nombre important d'allégations et de conclusions, comporte des lacunes trop nombreuses et importantes pour être corrigées par un amendement. De plus, et tel que mentionné précédemment, le demandeur n'a pas produit un projet de déclaration amendée au soutien de sa réponse à la requête en rejet d'action ni indiqué en quoi il pouvait modifier sa déclaration pour y corriger les lacunes.
[23]
Le demandeur a toutefois déposé, en annexe à sa requête en appel, une déclaration amendée. Je dois donc déterminer si je dois tenir compte de ce projet de déclaration amendée déposé dans le cadre du présent appel.
[24]
Il est de jurisprudence constante que seule la preuve qui a été présentée au protonotaire est admissible dans le cadre d'un appel
de novo
d'une décision d'un protonotaire. Le jugement de principe en la matière est
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 424 [
James River Corp
], où le juge Reed écrit aux paragraphes 31 à 33:
Si je comprends bien l'explication de l'avocat, le protonotaire adjoint a refusé de prononcer l'ordonnance demandée parce qu'aucun élément de preuve approprié ne lui a été présenté afin d'établir que la poursuite américaine existe réellement et que celle-ci est parallèle à la présente affaire. De même, aucune preuve montrant que la documentation souhaitée était pertinente quant à la présente instance n'a été soumise. Cette décision du protonotaire adjoint n'est pas contestée. L'avocat de la demanderesse a tenté de déposer auprès de la Cour un affidavit visant à fournir la preuve manquante. Il affirme que l'appel de la décision d'un protonotaire devant un juge constitue une nouvelle instance et que, par conséquent, j'étais en droit d'accepter cette preuve par affidavit et de rendre la décision que le protonotaire adjoint aurait rendue si la preuve en question lui avait été soumise.
À mon avis, ce n'est pas là le rôle du juge siégeant en appel de l'ordonnance d'un protonotaire. En effet, quelle que soit la différence, s'il en est, entre l'interprétation du juge en chef à la page 454 de l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  remettre. Il en ressort clairement que
le juge doit exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire en reprenant l'affaire depuis le début en fonction des éléments de preuve présentés au protonotaire, et non tenir une nouvelle audience fondée sur de nouveaux éléments de preuve.
L'avocat de la défenderesse signale que l'appel d'une ordonnance rendue par le protonotaire doit, suivant les Règles de la Cour fédérale, être introduit par une "demande" (règle 336(5)), et que toute demande à la Cour est faite par voie de requête (règle 319(1)). La requête débute par un avis de requête, non un avis d'appel, et doit être appuyée par un affidavit certifiant "tous les faits sur lesquels se fonde la requête sauf ceux qui ressortent du dossier" (règle 319(2)). Malgré cette apparente ambiguïté dans les Règles de la Cour fédérale, le processus qui y est établi consiste selon moi, comme je l'ai mentionné plus haut, en un appel fondé sur la preuve déposée devant le protonotaire, ce qui est compatible avec les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Dans certaines situations, de nouvelles preuves peuvent évidemment être prises en considération - voir la règle 1102 des Règles de la Cour fédérale et la jurisprudence portant sur celle-ci - mais ce n'est pas le cas en l'espèce.
[Je souligne.]
[25]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII) (disponible en anglais seulement), le juge Gauthier a cité l'affaire
James River Corp
, précitée, et précisé dans quelles circonstances une nouvelle preuve peut être prise en considération:
I must next deal with the defendant's objection to the filing of new evidence. As mentioned earlier, the plaintiffs filed new evidence15 which according to them proves that the misconduct of the defendants is ongoing, torturous, conspirational and criminal and speaks to matters that are pertinent to the jurisdiction of the Court. According to Mr. Carten's representations at the hearing, most of this information came into his possession or deals with events that took place after the date set up by Prothonotary Lafrenière for the filing of his evidence.
[...]
Generally, an appeal of a Prothonotary's Order is to be decided based on what was before that decision maker; no new evidence is admitted
;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.).
Exceptionally, new evidence may be admissible in circumstances where: it could not have been made available earlier; it will serve the interests of justice; it will assist the Court; and it will not seriously prejudice the other side
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 12;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
As mentioned, I reviewed the new evidence to assess whether it could have any impact whatsoever on the merits of this appeal. I have concluded that it does not. I am thus persuaded that it is not in the interests of justice and would not assist the Court to admit any of this evidence at this stage. This is not one of the exceptional cases referred to above. [Je souligne]

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 174;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 1]
[26]
Bien qu'en l'espèce le demandeur ne cherche pas à introduire de nouvelle preuve mais propose plutôt d'amender sa déclaration initiale, j'estime que les principes dégagés à l'égard de l'introduction d'une preuve additionnelle peuvent trouver application. Le juge saisi d'un appel d'une décision d'un protonotaire doit exercer sa discrétion à la lumière du dossier tel qu'il était constitué devant le protonotaire. L'appel ne doit pas servir d'occasion pour une partie de bonifier son dossier et je ne retrouve pas, en l'espèce, les éléments qui justifieraient de faire exception à la règle.
[27]
Premièrement, le demandeur n'a pas allégué avoir été dans l'impossibilité de présenter sa déclaration amendée dans le cadre de la réponse qu'il a déposée à l'encontre de la requête en radiation. Deuxièmement, je ne crois pas qu'il soit dans l'intérêt de la justice de considérer cette déclaration amendée puisque, de toute façon, elle ne corrige pas de façon adéquate les nombreuses lacunes de la déclaration initiale déposée par le demandeur. La déclaration amendée est essentiellement entachée des mêmes vices que la déclaration initiale. Le demandeur y fournit quelques informations supplémentaires concernant notamment son placement dans un établissement à sécurité moyenne, le refus initial de sa demande de sortie durant les fêtes, le refus de sa demande de libération conditionnelle, son assignation à résidence et la non-divulgation de documents relatifs à sa suspension. Cependant, la déclaration amendée est tout aussi décousue que la première, il est toujours impossible de déterminer à qui s'adressent certaines des réclamations, et la déclaration dans son ensemble manque de détails factuels pour soutenir les allégations et les conclusions qu'elle contient.
[28]
Pour tous ces motifs, l'appel est rejeté.

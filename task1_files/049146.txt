I.
Nature of the Matter and Background
[1]
Boswell, J.
: Pursuant to section 25(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the
Act
], the Applicants requested exemptions on humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] grounds from certain requirements for permanent residence, but their requests were refused. They now apply for judicial review under section 72(1) of the
Act
, asking the Court to set aside the negative decision and return the matter to another officer for re-determination.
[2]
The Applicants are a married couple in their sixties who arrived in Canada from Syria on March 24, 2010. After their visitor visas expired on July 12, 2010, they sought refugee protection on September 22, 2010. However, the Immigration and Refugee Board [the IRB] rejected their applications in late May, 2012, and this Court denied the Applicants leave to seek judicial review of that decision on October 23, 2012 (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for exemptions from certain requirements of the
Act
on H&C grounds. In particular, the Applicants wanted to apply for permanent residence from inside Canada and to obtain an exemption from the medical inadmissibility of Mr. Maroukel, who has several medical conditions that could potentially place a demand on health and social services. In their H&C application, the Applicants claimed a number of H&C grounds, including the civil unrest in Syria, an inability to obtain required medication in Syria, and their desire to remain with their 34 year old daughter, Fadia Maroukel, who is a Canadian citizen and who has children of her own.
II.
Decision under Review
[4]
On May 7, 2013, a senior immigration officer [the Officer] rejected the H&C application.
[5]
After summarizing the evidence submitted in their favour, the Officer determined that the Applicants' relationships in Canada were mostly with their own family and other people they knew from Syria. They were also unemployed and receiving social assistance, despite their daughter's sponsorship of them and her intention to provide support. The Officer therefore did not consider the Applicants to be very well-established or have any strong connection to Canada.
[6]
The Applicants had claimed that they would be discriminated against in Syria for being Assyrian Christians who have been introduced to the Jehovah's Witness faith while in Canada. The Officer acknowledged that Christians were likely to experience some discrimination in Syria, and also that Jehovah's Witnesses have been banned, but decided that these factors were not determinative.
[7]
With respect to the medical exemption, the Officer said that the Applicants had not proven that the medical treatments and medicine that Mr. Maroukel requires would be completely unavailable or too costly in Syria. However, the Officer acknowledged that it would have been difficult to find enough evidence to prove that because of the civil unrest in Syria, and so accepted that Mr. Maroukel would have difficulty obtaining the required treatments and medicine if the Applicants returned to Syria.
[8]
In assessing the Applicants' hardship, the Officer followed the test set out in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), 10 Imm LR (3d) 206 (TD), and acknowledged the other hardships submitted by the Applicants' counsel, notably the lack of family support in Syria (from which all the Applicants' other children had fled), the Applicants' advancing age and their poor employment prospects, and the civil conflict in Syria. The Officer concluded that the situation in Syria "is not comfortable for anyone who lives there and in many cases, it is dangerous".
[9]
The Applicants' daughter had also stated in her letter of support that she would be distressed if her parents returned to Syria, but the Officer stated that, while he was sympathetic to the daughter's difficulties, the consideration of the hardship is that faced by the Applicants.
[10]
The Officer thus decided that the Applicants' circumstances were not so exceptional that a positive exercise of his discretion under section 25(1) of the
Act
was warranted. The factors supporting the Applicants' claim did not overcome the facts that they had not "demonstrated deep connections to Canada; their refugee claim was refused and there are potential inadmissibilities arising from medical and lack of financial support".
III.
The Parties' Submissions
A.
The Applicants' Arguments
[11]
The Applicants argue that the Officer's decision was not reasonable since it ignored various aspects of the Applicants' circumstances. First, they say that the Officer's finding of a lack of financial support by the Applicants' daughter was contrary to the evidence since she had, in fact, offered to support and sponsor her parents.
[12]
With respect to the issue of the Applicants' establishment in Canada, the Applicants contend that the Officer did not give sufficient weight to the situation in Syria and the Canada Border Services Agency's [CBSA] policy to defer the removal of Syrian nationals (which has been in effect since March 15, 2012). The Applicants submit, based on the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 11 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], and on certain provisions in the chapter IP5 of the
Inland Processing Manual (Immigration Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds)
[the
Manual
], that had the Officer properly considered the situation in Syria, he or she would have found that the Applicants had a "prolonged inability" to return there. According to the Applicants, the Officer's failure to consider this material factor made the decision unreasonable.
[13]
With respect to the potential discrimination faced by the Applicants as Assyrian Christians, the Applicants state that the Officer did not complete his analysis in this regard because he did not make any finding as to how the Applicants would be perceived if they returned to Syria. According to the Applicants, there was sufficient evidence before the Officer that they would be discriminated against in Syria, so their minority religious beliefs should have been "part of a constellation of facts" considered (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4th) 539 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). The Applicants state that the Officer gave insufficient weight to the Applicants' religion and incorrectly looked only to their burgeoning leanings towards the Jehovah's Witnesses faith.
[14]
Lastly, the Applicants submit that there was evidence before the Officer that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for Mr. Maroukel to obtain necessary medication if he were returned to Syria. The Applicants argue that finding was not transparent, especially as the Officer nevertheless concluded that Mr. Maroukel would have issues finding the necessary medicine.
B.
The Respondent's Arguments
[15]
Citing the Federal Court of Appeal decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras 83-84, the Respondent argues that a wide range of reasonable and acceptable outcomes was open to the Officer in this case. This being so, the central issue is whether the Officer's decision falls within that range, and the Respondent argues that it does.
[16]
The Respondent also cites the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , noting that the Applicants had the burden of adducing proof of the claims upon which their H&C application was based, and argues that their written submissions to the Officer were "too sparse".
[17]
On the issue of the Applicants' establishment, the Respondent argues that the Officer reasonably found that the Applicants had only minimal establishment since the Applicants' contacts here in Canada were only a small group of family members and some Syrian friends.
[18]
With respect to the medical treatments and medicine, the Respondent argues that the evidence only revealed that the prescription medication required by Mr. Maroukel would not be covered in Syria, which does not mean that it would not be available. Moreover, the Respondent agrees with the Officer that it is the hardship that would be faced by the Applicants, and not their daughter, that must be assessed.
[19]
With respect to the country conditions in Syria, the Respondent argues that the Officer's determination that the Applicants would not face discrimination is a reasonable decision and falls within the range of reasonable outcomes. Moreover, in view of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII), the Respondent says that the Applicants did not link such country conditions on an individualized basis to them and show how they faced any personalized hardship.
[20]
As for any prolonged inability to leave Canada, the Respondent argues that there was no evidence that the Applicants could not leave this country.
IV.
Analysis
A.
Standard of Review
[21]
The appropriate standard of review for an H&C decision is that of reasonableness since it involves questions of mixed fact and law: see, e.g., <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras 32, 37;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[22]
In reviewing the Officer's decision on the reasonableness standard, the Court should not interfere if the Officer's decision is transparent, intelligible, justifiable, and falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and the law. A reviewing Court cannot reweigh the evidence that was before the Officer, nor can it substitute its own view of a preferable outcome:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . As a corollary, this means that the Court also does not have "carte blanche to reformulate a tribunal's decision in a way that casts aside an unreasonable chain of analysis in favour of the court's own rationale for the result" (
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
B.
Was the Officer's Decision Reasonable?
[23]
The Officer's decision was made under section 25 of the
Act
, the relevant portions of which appeared as follows when the application was submitted on June 19, 2012:
25.
(1) The Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.
...
(1.3) In examining the request of a foreign national in Canada, the Minister may not consider the factors that are taken into account in the determination of whether a person is a Convention refugee under section 96 or a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) but must consider elements related to the hardships that affect the foreign national.
25.
(1) Le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada qui est interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant hors du Canada, étudier le cas de cet étranger; il peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des considérations d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger le justifient, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché.
...
(1.3) Le ministre, dans l'étude de la demande faite au titre du paragraphe (1) d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada, ne tient compte d'aucun des facteurs servant à établir la qualité de réfugié - au sens de la Convention - aux termes de l'article 96 ou de personne à protéger au titre du paragraphe 97(1); il tient compte, toutefois, des difficultés auxquelles l'étranger fait face.
[24]
Prior to assessing the Officer's decision in this case, it is useful to look to the guidance offered by the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where the Federal Court of Appeal (per: Stratas J.A.) stated as follows:
[66] What then is the role of subsection 25(1.3)? In my view, it is not meant to change the overall standard of subsection 25(1) which, as we have seen, is to redress situations where the applicant will personally and directly suffer unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship.
...
[69] Subsection 25(1.3) provides, in effect, that a humanitarian and compassionate relief application must not duplicate the processes under sections 96 and 97 of the Act, i.e., assess the risk factors for the purposes of sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
[70] But this is not to say that the facts that were adduced in proceedings under sections 96 and 97 of the Act are irrelevant to a humanitarian and compassionate relief application. Far from it.
[71] While the facts may not have given the applicant relief under sections 96 or 97, they may nevertheless form part of a constellation of facts that give rise to humanitarian and compassionate grounds warranting relief under subsection 25(1).
...
[73] ... the evidence adduced in previous proceedings under sections 96 and 97 along with whatever other evidence that applicant might wish to adduce is admissible in subsection 25(1) proceedings. Officers, however, must assess that evidence through the lens of the subsection 25(1) test - is the applicant personally and directly suffering unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship?
...
[76] It follows that I agree with Justice Hughes' comments in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
I conclude that the Guidelines got it right in construing how the amended provisions of section 25 of IRPA are to be interpreted. We are to abandon the old lingo and jurisprudence respecting personalized and generalized risk and focus upon the hardship to the individual. Included within the broader exercise in considering such hardship is consideration of "adverse country conditions that have a direct negative impact on the applicant."
[25]
In view of the foregoing, one must ask whether the Officer in this case properly and reasonably assessed the evidence before him "through the lens of the subsection 25(1) test". In other words, was it reasonable for the Officer to decide that the Applicants would not personally and directly suffer unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship?
[26]
The Officer's decision was rendered on May 7, 2013. The Applicants point to a notice issued by Citizenship and Immigration Canada on April 17, 2013, which states that, "[s] ince March 15, 2012, the Canada Border Services Agency has had in place an administrative deferral of removals for Syrian nationals in Canada due to the civil unrest in Syria". While this notice is not part of the certified record and is not referred to in the Officer's decision, the Applicants submit that the Officer is deemed to have knowledge of such notices, and the very fact there is such a deferral of removals goes to establish the Applicants' "prolonged inability" to return to Syria.
[27]
In this regard, the Applicants rely upon the decision of my colleague Mr. Justice John O'Keefe in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paras 28-30, where he quoted from pertinent sections of the
Manual
in use at the time and concluded that:
[29] These previous factors make it obvious that a "prolonged inability to leave Canada" is a relevant factor in determining establishment of an applicant.
[30] The immigration officer in this case found that the applicant's stay in Canada has not been due to a situation beyond his control. The only evidence is contrary to this finding. The applicant could not get a passport. He also cooperated with the authorities. I am of the view that the immigration officer misapprehended the evidence. Since this evidence was relevant to the establishment of the applicant in Canada which in turn could effect [
sic
] the outcome of his H & C application, the officer made a reviewable error.
[28]
The
Manual
referred to in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> has been updated since 2006, but the current
Manual
, dated April 1, 2011, has provisions comparable to those considered in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
5.14. Establishment in Canada
...
Positive H&C consideration may be warranted when the period of inability to leave Canada due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control is of considerable duration and where there is evidence of a significant degree of establishment in Canada such that it would cause the applicant unusual or disproportionate hardship to apply from outside Canada.
The following table may assist to clarify what is meant by circumstances beyond the applicant's control:
Circumstances beyond the applicant's control
Circumstances not beyond the applicant's control
Example:
If general country conditions are considered unsafe due to war, civil unrest, environmental disaster, etc., the Minister of Public Safety may impose a temporary suspension of removals (TSR) on that country (
R230
).
Example:
An applicant, in Canada for a number of years, is unwilling to sign a passport application or provide particulars for a passport application.
Example:
An applicant was awaiting a decision on an immigration application and spent several years in Canada with status (e.g. Live-in-caregiver program).
Example:
An applicant wilfully loses or destroys their travel document(s).
In such cases the ability to leave Canada can be considered to be due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control.
Example:
Applicant goes "underground" and remains in Canada illegally.
-
In such cases, inability to leave Canada is not considered beyond the control of the applicant and could reasonably be viewed as a strong negative factor. See Legault decision at
http://decisions.fca.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca125/2002fca125.html
.
Temporary suspension of removals (TSRs) and establishment
Situations may arise where the suspension of removals continues for a number of years and there is no other viable destination option for the applicant. When a TSR continues for a number of years and foreign nationals affected by it have become established in Canada as a result of their prolonged stay, this could reasonably be considered circumstances beyond the applicant's control.
In cases where the foreign national's H&C application is assessed after the lifting of a TSR but the applicant's prolonged stay in Canada during the time of the TSR led to their establishment, the applicant's extended presence in Canada can still be considered to be a result of circumstances beyond the applicant's control.
For a list of the countries under a TSR, refer to
http://cicintranet.ci.gc.ca/cbsa-asfc/ebdgel/reference/man-pol-proc/inlandenf-execint/pol-pub/temp_susp_rem_e.asp#6
.
11.4 Prolonged stay or inability to leave has led to establishment
See also
Section 5.14,
Establishment in Canada
.
There is no hard and fast rule relating to the period of time in Canada but it is expected that a significant degree of establishment takes several years to achieve.
Officers should consider the following factors:
• The length of time the applicant has been in Canada.
• Were the circumstances that led the applicant to remain in Canada beyond their control?
• Is there a significant degree of establishment in Canada? (see also
Section 11.5,
Assessing applicant's degree of establishment.
)
• Is, or was, the applicant the subject of a temporary suspension of removal (TSR)?
• To what degree has the applicant co-operated with the Government of Canada, particularly with regard to travel documents?
• Did the applicant wilfully lose or destroy travel documents?
[29]
The Officer concluded that the situation in Syria "is not comfortable for anyone who lives there and in many cases, it is dangerous". According to the Applicants, the country conditions in Syria are such that they face a prolonged inability to return there and this was a material factor which was not adequately assessed by the Officer, which makes the decision unreasonable.
[30]
I agree with the Applicants that the Officer unreasonably ignored the country conditions in Syria at the time. One can easily take judicial notice of the fact that the civil unrest in Syria continues to this day and was occurring when the Officer rejected the H&C application. It is not for this Court to determine whether such unrest has worsened or whether conditions in Syria have improved since that time.
[31]
The fact of the matter is that the Applicants, since such unrest began in late 2011, have faced and for the foreseeable future will face a prolonged inability to return to Syria because of the adverse country conditions there, which are clearly circumstances beyond their control.
[32]
In my view, it also was unreasonable for the Officer, on the one hand, to conclude that country conditions in Syria are "dangerous" and then, on the other, to ignore the direct negative impact such conditions would have upon the Applicants since it "is not comfortable for anyone who lives there."
[33]
The Respondent argues that the Applicants did not link such country conditions on an individualized basis to them and show how they faced any personalized hardship. In my view, that lingo is not helpful insofar as it invokes tests under paragraph 97(1)(b) of the
Act
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 76). It is true that applicants must be personally and directly affected by any hardship they rely upon, and so "must show a link between the evidence of hardship and their individual situations" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 48). To similar effect, Mr Justice John O'Keefe said the following in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (4th) 234:
[Subsection 25(1.3) of the
Act
] ... restricts consideration only to the "elements related to the hardships that
affect
the foreign national" (emphasis added). That means that not every hardship that a person in the country of origin could conceivably suffer needs to be dealt with. Rather, the applicants must show either that it will probably affect them or, at the very least, that living in conditions where it could happen to them is itself an unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
[34]
This sort of hardship does not necessarily need to be established through personal evidence though, since there can be "circumstances where the conditions in the country of origin are such that they support a reasoned inference as to the challenges a particular applicant would face on return" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Donald Rennie held that it was unreasonable for an officer to decide that the applicant had not proven that he would be affected by the country conditions in Niger, in light of that officer's findings that it was the poorest country on earth, 8% of its population was enslaved, 200,000 people had been displaced by war, and a longstanding drought was endangering the agricultural industry upon which 80% of the population depended for their livelihood ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 10).
[35]
Similarly, the Officer in this case found that the adverse country conditions directly affect everyone in Syria, and that is enough. The focus should be upon the hardship to the individual and, once established, that hardship need not be greater than that faced by anyone else in that country. This applies especially where the expected hardship is such that the CBSA's present policy is not to remove any Syrian national back to that country.
[36]
As the Officer's decision is not reasonable for the foregoing reasons, I see no need to address the other issues raised by the parties.
[37]
Accordingly, this matter should be sent back for re-determination by a different officer, having these reasons in mind.
[38]
Neither party raised any question of general importance which requires certification.
JUDGMENT
[39]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. the application for judicial review is granted;
2. there shall be no award of costs; and
3. no serious question of general importance is certified.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  contexte
[1]
Le juge Boswell
[Traduction]: Les demandeurs ont sollicité, en vertu du paragraphe 25(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la Loi], la levée pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire de certaines exigences relatives à la résidence permanente, mais leurs demandes ont été refusées. Ils sollicitent à présent le contrôle judiciaire de cette décision en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la Loi, et demandent à la Cour d'infirmer la décision défavorable et de renvoyer l'affaire à un autre agent pour qu'il la réexamine.
[2]
Les demandeurs, un couple marié dans la soixantaine, sont arrivés au Canada en provenance de Syrie le 24 mai 2010. Leurs visas de visiteurs ont expiré le 12 juillet 2010, et ils ont présenté des demandes d'asile le 22 septembre suivant. Cependant, la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [la CISR] les a rejetées à la fin mai 2012, et la Cour leur a refusé l'autorisation de présenter une demande de contrôle judiciaire le 23 octobre de la même année (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandé à être dispensés de certaines exigences de la Loi pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. Ils souhaitaient notamment présenter une demande de résidence permanente à partir du Canada et obtenir la levée de l'interdiction de territoire pour motifs sanitaires visant M. Maroukel, lequel est atteint de plusieurs maladies risquant d'entraîner un fardeau excessif pour les services sociaux et de santé. Dans leur demande, les demandeurs faisaient valoir un certain nombre de motifs d'ordre humanitaire, dont les troubles civils en Syrie, leur incapacité à obtenir les médicaments nécessaires dans ce pays, et leur désir de rester aux côtés de leur fille de 34 ans, Fadia Maroukel, une citoyenne canadienne elle-même mère de famille.
II.
Décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[4]
Le 7 mai 2013, un agent d'immigration supérieur [l'agent] a rejeté la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire.
[5]
Après avoir résumé les éléments de preuve présentés en leur faveur, l'agent a déterminé que les liens des demandeurs avec le Canada concernaient surtout les membres de leur propre famille et d'autres connaissances originaires de Syrie. De plus, ils étaient au chômage et recevaient des prestations d'aide sociale, malgré le parrainage de leur fille et son intention de leur apporter du soutien. L'agent a donc estimé que les demandeurs n'étaient pas bien établis et qu'ils n'avaient pas de liens solides avec le Canada.
[6]
Les demandeurs soutenaient qu'ils seraient victimes de discrimination en Syrie en tant que chrétiens assyriens ayant découvert la foi des Témoins de Jéhovah durant leur séjour au Canada. L'agent a reconnu que les chrétiens étaient susceptibles d'être victimes de discrimination en Syrie, et que les Témoins de Jéhovah avaient été bannis, mais a jugé que ces facteurs n'étaient pas déterminants.
[7]
En ce qui concerne la levée de l'interdiction de territoire pour motifs sanitaires, l'agent a déclaré que les demandeurs n'avaient pas prouvé qu'il était impossible ou trop coûteux en Syrie de recevoir et de se procurer les traitements médicaux et les médicaments dont M. Maroukel avait besoin. Il a toutefois reconnu qu'il aurait été difficile de le démontrer par des éléments de preuve suffisants compte tenu des troubles civils en Syrie, et il a donc tenu pour prouver que M. Maroukel aurait de la difficulté à obtenir les traitements et les médicaments requis si les demandeurs retournaient en Syrie.
[8]
Quant à l'évaluation des difficultés auxquelles se heurteraient les demandeurs, l'agent a appliqué le critère énoncé dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), 10 Imm LR (3d) 206 (1re inst.), et reconnu l'existence des autres difficultés auxquelles les demandeurs disaient être exposés advenant un retour en Syrie, à savoir l'absence de soutien familial dans ce pays (que tous leurs autres enfants ont fui), leur âge avancé, leurs perspectives d'emploi médiocres, et le conflit civil dans le pays. L'agent a conclu que la situation en Syrie [traduction] « n'est facile pour aucun de ses habitants et, dans bien des cas, elle est dangereuse ».
[9]
La fille des demandeurs a également indiqué dans sa lettre de soutien que le retour de ses parents en Syrie la bouleverserait; tout en compatissant avec ses difficultés, l'agent a rappelé que les difficultés qu'il devait prendre en compte étaient celles auxquelles les demandeurs eux-mêmes se heurteraient.
[10]
L'agent a donc conclu que la situation des demandeurs n'était pas exceptionnelle au point de justifier qu'il exerce en leur faveur son pouvoir discrétionnaire fondé sur le paragraphe 25(1) de la Loi. Les facteurs favorables à leur demande ne l'emportaient pas sur le fait que les demandeurs n'avaient pas [traduction] « établi de liens profonds avec le Canada; que leur demande d'asile a été refusée, et que leur situation médicale, et le soutien financier insuffisant dont ils bénéfici[aient], risque[aient] d'entraîner leur interdiction de territoire ».
III.
Les observations des parties
A.
Les arguments des demandeurs
[11]
Les demandeurs font valoir que la décision de l'agent n'est pas raisonnable parce qu'il a négligé divers aspects de leur situation. Ils affirment tout d'abord que la conclusion de l'agent concernant l'absence de soutien financier de leur fille contredisait la preuve, puisque cette dernière avait, de fait, proposé de les parrainer et de subvenir à leurs besoins.
[12]
S'agissant de leur établissement au Canada, les demandeurs soutiennent que l'agent n'a pas accordé suffisamment de poids à la situation en Syrie et à la politique de l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada [ASFC] de reporter le renvoi des ressortissants syriens (politique en vigueur depuis le 15 mars 2012). Les demandeurs invoquent la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 11 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], ainsi que certaines dispositions du chapitre IP5 du
Guide sur le traitement des demandes présentées au Canada (Demande présentée par des immigrants au Canada pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire)
[le Guide], et font valoir que si l'agent avait convenablement évalué la situation en Syrie, il aurait conclu que les demandeurs étaient dans l' « incapacité prolongée » d'y retourner. Ils estiment que la décision est déraisonnable en ce qu'elle ne prend pas en compte ce facteur important.
[13]
Quant à la discrimination à laquelle ils s'exposent en tant que chrétiens assyriens, les demandeurs affirment que l'agent n'a pas achevé son analyse sur ce point puisqu'il n'est arrivé à aucune conclusion sur la manière dont ils seraient perçus advenant leur retour en Syrie. D'après les demandeurs, les éléments de preuve dont l'agent disposait étaient suffisants pour établir qu'ils seraient victimes de discrimination dans ce pays, de sorte que leur croyance religieuse minoritaire aurait dû « faire partie d'un éventail de faits » à prendre en compte (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 71, 372 DLR (4th) 539 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Les demandeurs estiment que l'agent n'a pas accordé suffisamment de poids à leur religion, n'examinant à tort que leur intérêt grandissant pour la foi des Témoins de Jéhovah.
[14]
Enfin, les demandeurs font valoir que l'agent disposait d'éléments de preuve établissant qu'il serait difficile, sinon impossible, à M. Maroukel d'obtenir les médicaments nécessaires s'il devait retourner en Syrie. Ils soutiennent que sa conclusion manquait de transparence, d'autant que l'agent a déterminé par ailleurs que M. Maroukel aurait de la difficulté à trouver les médicaments dont il avait besoin.
B.
Les arguments du défendeur
[15]
Le défendeur cite la décision rendue par la Cour d'appel fédérale dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 83 et 84, et soutient qu'en l'espèce un large éventail d'issues raisonnables et acceptables s'ouvrait à l'agent. La question centrale est donc de savoir si sa décision appartient à cet éventail; le défendeur soutient qu'il faut répondre par l'affirmative.
[16]
Le défendeur cite également l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , notant qu'il incombait aux demandeurs de prouver les allégations sur lesquelles reposait leur demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, et faisant valoir que les observations écrites qu'ils ont soumises à l'agent étaient [traduction] « trop peu étoffées ».
[17]
S'agissant de l'établissement des demandeurs, le défendeur soutient que l'agent a raisonnablement conclu que celui-ci n'était que minimal puisque leurs relations au Canada se limitaient à un petit groupe de parents et quelques amis syriens.
[18]
Pour ce qui est des traitements médicaux et des médicaments, le défendeur affirme que la preuve révélait uniquement que les médicaments sur ordonnance que M. Maroukel devait prendre n'étaient pas couverts en Syrie, ce qui ne signifie pas qu'ils n'étaient pas disponibles. Qui plus est, le défendeur convient avec l'agent que ce sont les difficultés auxquelles s'exposent les demandeurs, et non leur fille, qui doivent être évaluées.
[19]
En ce qui concerne la situation en Syrie, le défendeur fait valoir que la décision de l'agent selon laquelle les demandeurs ne seraient pas victimes de discrimination est raisonnable et appartient aux issues raisonnables. De plus, s'appuyant sur la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 37 (disponible sur CanLII), il affirme que les demandeurs n'ont établi un lien entre la situation qui règne dans le pays et leur situation propre, ni montré en quoi ils se heurteraient à des difficultés.
[20]
Quant à l'incapacité prolongée de quitter le Canada, le défendeur soutient que rien n'indiquait que les demandeurs ne pouvaient pas quitter le pays.
IV.
Analyse
A.
Norme de contrôle
[21]
La norme de contrôle qu'il convient d'appliquer aux décisions fondées sur des motifs humanitaires est celle de la décision raisonnable puisque de telles décisions font intervenir des questions de fait et de droit: voir, p. ex., <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 32 et 37;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[22]
Au moment de contrôler la décision de l'agent suivant la norme de la décision raisonnable, la Cour doit se garder d'intervenir si cette décision est transparente, intelligible et justifiable, et si elle appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Les tribunaux de révision ne peuvent pas réévaluer la preuve dont disposait l'agent, ni substituer à sa décision l'issue qui leur paraît préférable:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Corollairement, cela signifie que la Cour ne dispose pas non plus d'un « pouvoir absolu de reformuler la décision en substituant à l'analyse qu'elle juge déraisonnable sa propre justification du résultat » (
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
B.
La décision de l'agent était-elle raisonnable?
[23]
La décision de l'agent était fondée sur l'article 25 de la Loi, dont les dispositions pertinentes étaient les suivantes au moment où la demande a été soumise le 19 juin 2012:
25.
(1) Le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada qui est interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant hors du Canada, étudier le cas de cet étranger; il peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des considérations d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger le justifient, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché.
[...]
(1.3) Le ministre, dans l'étude de la demande faite au titre du paragraphe (1) d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada, ne tient compte d'aucun des facteurs servant à établir la qualité de réfugié - au sens de la Convention - aux termes de l'article 96 ou de personne à protéger au titre du paragraphe 97(1); il tient compte, toutefois, des difficultés auxquelles l'étranger fait face.
25.
(1) The Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.
...
(1.3) In examining the request of a foreign national in Canada, the Minister may not consider the factors that are taken into account in the determination of whether a person is a Convention refugee under section 96 or a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) but must consider elements related to the hardships that affect the foreign national.
[24]
Avant d'évaluer la décision de l'agent en l'espèce, il est utile de se reporter aux directives formulées dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , où la Cour d'appel fédérale (sous la plume du juge Stratas) déclarait:
[66] Quel est alors l'objet du paragraphe 25(1.3)? Cet objet n'est pas selon moi de modifier le critère général consacré par le paragraphe 25(1) qui, comme on l'a vu, vise à remédier aux situations où le demandeur subirait, personnellement et directement, des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives.
[...]
[69] Le paragraphe 25(1.3) prévoit en fait que le processus de demande de dispense pour considérations humanitaires ne doit pas faire double emploi avec les processus fondés sur les articles 96 et 97 de la Loi, qui concernent l'évaluation des facteurs de risque aux fins de ces articles.
[70] Il ne s'ensuit toutefois pas que les faits exposés dans une procédure relevant des articles 96 et 97 de la Loi sont sans intérêt dans le cadre d'une demande de dispense pour considérations d'ordre humanitaire. Loin de là d'ailleurs.
[71] Quoique les faits aient pu ne pas donner ouverture, pour le demandeur, à la protection offerte par les articles 96 et 97, ils peuvent néanmoins faire partie d'un éventail de faits équivalant à des considérations d'ordre humanitaire qui justifient la dispense aux termes du paragraphe 25(1).
[...]
[73] [...] [L]es éléments de preuve produits dans le cadre d'une procédure antérieure fondée sur les articles 96 et 97, ainsi que toute
[sic
] autre élément que le demandeur pourra vouloir présenter, est admissible dans une procédure au titre du paragraphe 25(1). Les agents doivent toutefois apprécier ces éléments à travers le prisme du critère du paragraphe 25(1) et ainsi rechercher si le demandeur fait face personnellement et directement à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives.
[...]
[76] Je souscris par conséquent aux observations suivantes formulées par le juge Hughes à l'occasion de l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Je conclus que les auteurs des lignes directrices ont vu juste quant à l'interprétation qu'il convient de faire des dispositions modifiées de l'article 25 de la LIPR. Nous devons abandonner le vieux jargon et l'ancienne jurisprudence relatifs aux risques personnalisés et généralisés et nous concentrer sur les difficultés qu'éprouverait l'intéressé. Cet exercice plus général d'examen des difficultés en question comprend la prise en compte « des conditions défavorables dans le pays qui ont une incidence néfaste directe sur le demandeur ».
[25]
Compte tenu de ce qui précède, il convient de se demander si l'agent en l'espèce a dûment et raisonnablement évalué la preuve dont il disposait « à travers le prisme du critère du paragraphe 25(1) ». En d'autres termes, était-il raisonnable de sa part de conclure que les demandeurs ne se heurteraient pas personnellement ni directement à des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives?
[26]
La décision de l'agent a été rendue le 7 mai 2013. Les demandeurs se réfèrent à un avis délivré par Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada le 17 avril précédent, qui indique qu' « [e] n raison de l'agitation civile en Syrie, l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (ASFC) a imposé, le 15 mars 2012, un sursis administratif aux renvois visant les ressortissants syriens au Canada, sursis qui est toujours en vigueur ». Bien que cet avis ne fasse pas partie du dossier certifié et qu'il ne soit pas mentionné dans la décision de l'agent, les demandeurs soutiennent que ce dernier est réputé avoir connaissance de tels avis, et que le fait même que les renvois soient reportés établit leur « incapacité prolongée » de retourner en Syrie.
[27]
À cet égard, les demandeurs invoquent la décision rendue par mon collègue, le juge John O'Keefe, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 28 à 30, où il reproduit des paragraphes pertinents du Guide alors en vigueur et conclut que:
[29] Il est évident au vu des facteurs énumérés plus haut que l' « incapacité prolongée de quitter le Canada » est pertinente pour l'évaluation du degré d'établissement d'un demandeur.
[30] L'agente d'immigration dans la présente affaire a jugé que le séjour du demandeur au Canada n'était pas attribuable à des circonstances qui échappaient à son contrôle. Le seul élément de preuve contredit cette conclusion. Le demandeur ne pouvait pas obtenir de passeport. Il a aussi collaboré avec les autorités. Je suis d'avis que l'agente d'immigration a mal apprécié la preuve. Comme cette preuve était pertinente quant à l'établissement du demandeur au Canada et que cet établissement pouvait influer sur sa demande CH, l'agente a commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle judiciaire.
[28]
Le Guide cité dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> a été mis à jour depuis 2006, mais le Guide actuel, daté du 1er avril 2011, contient des dispositions comparables à celles qui sont examinées dans cette décision:
5.14. Établissement au Canada
[...]
Il peut être justifié d'approuver la demande CH si l'incapacité du demandeur à quitter le Canada en raison de circonstances indépendantes de sa volonté se prolonge pendant une longue période et que les éléments de preuve corroborent un degré appréciable d'établissement au Canada, au point où le demandeur ferait face à des difficultés inhabituelles ou démesurées s'il devait faire sa demande à l'extérieur du Canada.
Le tableau suivant peut aider à préciser en quoi consistent des circonstances indépendantes de la volonté du demandeur:
Circonstances indépendantes de la volonté du demandeur
Circonstances non indépendantes de la volonté du demandeur
Exemple:
Si la situation générale dans le pays est jugée dangereuse en raison d'une guerre, de troubles civils, d'une catastrophe environnementale, etc., le ministre de la Sécurité publique peut imposer une suspension temporaire des renvois (STR) vers ce pays (R230).
Exemple:
Un demandeur, au Canada depuis un certain nombre d'années, n'est pas disposé à signer une demande de passeport ou à fournir des renseignements pour une demande de passeport.
Exemple:
Un demandeur, en attente d'une décision sur une demande d'immigration, demeure plusieurs années au Canada avec un statut (p. ex. programme des aides familiaux résidants).
Exemple:
Le demandeur perd ou détruit volontairement ses titres de voyage.
-
Exemple:
Le demandeur entre dans la clandestinité et demeure illégalement au Canada.
Dans de tels cas, on peut considérer que l'incapacité à quitter le Canada découle de circonstances indépendantes de la volonté du demandeur.
Dans de tels cas, l'incapacité de quitter le Canada ne découle pas de circonstances indépendantes de la volonté du demandeur et pourrait constituer un facteur très défavorable. Voir l'arrêt Legault au http://decisions.fcacaf.gc.ca/fr/2002/2002caf125/2002caf125.html.
Suspension temporaire des renvois (STR) et établissement
Il peut arriver que la suspension des renvois soit maintenue pendant plusieurs années et qu'il n'y ait aucune autre destination viable pour le demandeur. Si la STR dure plusieurs années et que l'étranger visé s'est établi au Canada en raison de son séjour prolongé, on pourrait considérer qu'il s'agit de circonstances indépendantes de la volonté du demandeur.
Dans le cas où la demande CH de l'étranger est examinée après la levée de la STR, mais que le séjour prolongé du demandeur au Canada pendant cette période a mené à son établissement, la présence continue au Canada peut quand même être le résultat de circonstances indépendantes de la volonté du demandeur.
Une liste des pays visés par une STR est affichée à http://atlas/eb-dgel/reference/manpol-proc/inlandenf-execint/pol-pub/temp_susp_rem_f.asp
.
11.4 Séjour prolongé ou incapacité de partir ayant mené à l'établissement
Voir aussi la section 5.14,
Établissement au Canada
.
Il n'y a pas de règle absolue sur le temps passé au Canada, mais il est présumé qu'il faut plusieurs années pour bien s'établir.
L'agent doit tenir compte des facteurs suivants:
• Le temps que le demandeur a passé au Canada.
• Les circonstances qui ont amené le demandeur à rester au Canada étaient-elles indépendantes de sa volonté?
• Existe-t-il un degré important d'établissement au Canada (voir la section 11.5,
Évaluation du degré d'établissement du demandeur
).
• Le demandeur est-il ou était-il visé par une suspension temporaire des renvois (STR)?
• Dans quelle mesure le demandeur a-t-il coopéré avec le gouvernement du Canada, surtout en ce qui concerne les titres de voyage?
• Le demandeur a-t-il volontairement perdu ou détruit ses titres de voyage?
[29]
L'agent a conclu que la situation en Syrie [traduction] « n'est facile pour aucun de ses habitants et, dans bien des cas, elle est dangereuse ». Pour les demandeurs, la situation qui règne dans ce pays est telle qu'ils sont dans l'incapacité prolongée d'y retourner; il s'agissait d'un facteur pertinent que l'agent n'a pas évalué adéquatement, ce qui rend sa décision déraisonnable.
[30]
Je conviens avec les demandeurs que l'agent a déraisonnablement ignoré la situation qui régnait alors en Syrie. Nous pouvons aisément admettre d'office que l'agitation civile continue aujourd'hui et qu'elle avait cours lorsque l'agent a refusé la demande fondée sur des motifs humanitaires. Il n'appartient pas à la Cour de déterminer si cette agitation s'est aggravée ou si les conditions se sont améliorées depuis.
[31]
Le fait est que depuis le début des troubles à la fin de 2011, les demandeurs étaient et seront dans un avenir prévisible dans l'incapacité prolongée de retourner en Syrie en raison des conditions défavorables dans ce pays, qui sont certainement des circonstances échappant à leur contrôle.
[32]
À mon avis, il était également déraisonnable de la part de l'agent de conclure, d'une part, que la situation en Syrie est [traduction] « dangereuse » et, d'autre part, d'ignorer l'incidence néfaste directe que cette situation aurait sur les demandeurs, puisqu'elle [traduction] « n'est facile pour aucun de ses habitants ».
[33]
Le défendeur soutient que les demandeurs n'ont pas établi un lien entre la situation au pays et la situation qui leur est propre, ni montré dans quelle mesure ils se heurteraient à des difficultés personnelles. À mon avis, ce jargon est vide de sens dans la mesure où il renvoie à des critères qui concernent l'alinéa 97(1)
b
) de la Loi (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 76). Il est vrai que les demandeurs doivent être personnellement et directement touchés par les difficultés qu'ils invoquent, et qu'ils « [doivent] établir un lien entre la preuve des difficultés qu'ils font valoir et leur situation particulière » ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 48). Dans le même ordre d'idées, le juge John O'Keefe déclarait dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (4th) 234:
[Le paragraphe 25(1.3) de la Loi] [...] oblige le ministre à ne tenir compte que « des difficultés auxquelles l'étranger
fait face
» (non souligné dans l'original). Il s'ensuit qu'il n'est pas nécessaire d'examiner chacune des difficultés auxquelles pourrait vraisemblablement faire face l'intéressé dans son pays d'origine. Le demandeur doit plutôt démontrer soit qu'il fera probablement face aux difficultés en question ou, à tout le moins, que le fait de vivre dans un contexte où ce genre de difficultés est susceptible de se produire constitue en soi des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives.
[34]
Cependant, il n'est pas nécessaire que ce type de difficultés soient établies par des éléments de preuve les concernant personnellement, puisqu'il peut y avoir « des circonstances où les conditions dans le pays d'origine sont telles qu'elles confortent l'inférence raisonnable relativement aux difficultés auxquelles un demandeur en particulier serait exposé à son retour » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible dans CanLII) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Donald Rennie a jugé qu'il était déraisonnable de la part de l'agent de conclure que le demandeur n'avait pas prouvé qu'il serait affecté par les conditions régnant au Niger, dans la mesure où il avait conclu que c'était le pays le plus pauvre du monde, que 8 % de sa population est tenue dans l'esclavage, que 200 000 personnes avaient été déplacées par la guerre, et qu'une longue sécheresse menaçait l'industrie agricole dont dépend 80 % de la population pour tirer sa subsistance ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 10).
[35]
De même, l'agent a conclu en l'espèce que les conditions défavorables dans le pays touchaient directement tous les habitants de la Syrie, et cela suffit. L'accent doit être mis sur les difficultés auxquelles la personne visée se heurte et une fois établies, ces difficultés ne doivent pas être plus importantes que celles qui concernent tous les autres habitants de ce pays. C'est particulièrement le cas lorsque les difficultés prévisibles sont telles que l'actuelle politique de l'ASFC est de ne pas renvoyer les ressortissants syriens dans ce pays.
[36]
Comme la décision de l'agent n'est pas raisonnable pour les motifs qui précèdent, je ne vois pas la nécessité de traiter des autres questions soulevées par les parties.
[37]
Par conséquent, l'affaire devra être renvoyée pour réexamen par un autre agent, qui tiendra compte des présents motifs.
[38]
Aucune partie n'a soulevé de question de portée générale méritant certification.
JUGEMENT
[39]
LA COUR STATUE que:
1. la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie;
2. aucuns dépens ne sont adjugés;
3. aucune question de portée générale n'est certifiée.

 Admission - Refugees - Grounds - Well-founded fear of persecution - Maldonado, a citizen of El Salvador, claimed a well-founded fear of persecution - The Con­vention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board found Maldonado credible, but determined that there was not a well-founded fear of persecution because of changes in El Salvador since Maldonado left, ie. a peace accord was negotiated and a ceasefire went into effect in February 1992 - The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, held that the finding based on changed country conditions could not stand - The imple­mentation of the accord fell short of dem­onstrating fundamental and significant change of proven durability or significant, effective and durable change.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 [1] Gibson, J. 
 : This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division (the CRDD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board wherein the CRDD determined the applicant not to be Convention refugee within the meaning of the  
 Immigration Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2. The decision is dated the 13th day of May, 1992.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  The applicant is a citizen of El Salvador. She claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution if she is returned to El Salvador by reason of her political opinion and her membership in a particular social group. Her evidence indicates that, in late 1989, she did not support the government of El Salvador but rather supported the aims of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). She had received some training in nursing. In the months of November and December, 1989, on three occasions, she provided nursing assistance to wounded members of the FMLN at the request of their comrades. After the third occasion, she did not return home. Persons unknown to her grandmother with whom she had lived visited her home and enquired as to her whereabouts. She referred the military since she considered they might have found out about the humanitarian aid she had provided. She came to fear the FMLN on the basis that they might have concluded that she had collaborated with the military since breaking off contact with them. Sometime after Christmas, she received a death threat. She obtained a passport and fled the country. She arrived in Canada on the 7th day of May 1990 and claimed Convention refugee status that day.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  The applicant's hearing before the CRDD commenced on the 9th day of January, 1992. On the 1st day of February, 1992, a peace accord was implemented in El Salvador. The applicant's hearing concluded on the 6th day of March, 1992.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  In its decision, the CRDD made no adverse finding regarding the applicant's credibility. Nor did the CRDD make any finding with regard to the applicant's Convention refugee status in the absence of changed country circumstances. Its succinct conclusion and analysis in this regard is in the following terms:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The panel has carefully considered all of the evidence and concludes that there is nothing more than a mere possibility that the claimant would be persecuted if she were to return to El Salvador. We make this decision based on the changes which have taken place in El Salvador since the claimant left in 1990.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "A ceasefire went into effect on February 1, 1992. The ceasefire is the culmination of a peace accord negotiated between the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and the government of El Salvador with the United Nations acting as mediator.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Counsel has submitted that the ceasefire has not been in place long enough to point to a fundamental and lasting change in the conditions in El Salvador.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Undoubtedly there will be isolated incidents of violence by groups who have vested interests in seeing that peace does not last. There are indications that right wing death squads will attempt to derail the peace process.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "However, the documentary evidence points to a concrete plan of action which has already resulted in an amnesty for members of the FMLN. In fact, top rebel leaders are returning to El Salvador and preparing to engage in the mainstream political process. The signing of the agreement is seen as irreversible and likely to be respected according to activists on both sides of the conflict.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the army will have no interest in the claimant if she were to return to El Salvador. We also conclude that it is sheer speculation as opposed to reasonable inference on the claimant's part that the guerrillas would be a threat to her safety.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Consequently, the Refugee Division determines Gilma Yanira Maldonado not to be a Convention refugee. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Nadon, J., adopted as the proper test of changing country conditions or circumstances the one proposed by James Hathaway in  
 The Law of Refugee Status 
 , Butterworths, Toronto, 1991, at pp. 200-203. He summarizes the test as one "... pursuant to which fundamental and significant changes of proven durability must be shown...". In another context, he describes the change required as "... significant, effective and durable." Nadon, J., cites two decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal as support for his adoption of the Hathaway test. Those cases are  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) and  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). In each of those cases, Marceau, J.A., spoke of the test to be applied as that of "meaningful and effective change" rather than that of fundamental and significant change of proven durability, or significant, effective and durable change. Whatever terminology is used, I am in agreement with Nadon, J. that the Federal Court of Appeal cases cited support the specific adoption of the Hathaway test. The specific addition of the concept of durability is, I am satisfied only making explicit a concept which is inherent in the expression "meaningful and effective change".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  After reviewing two recent decisions of this court that appear to reject the Hathaway test, Nadon, J., stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "I cannot agree with my colleagues on this point. I am of the view that Hathaway's test is not opposed to the reasoning of Pratte, J.A. in  
 Mileva 
 . In that part of his judgment in  
 Mileva 
 , quoted by McKeown in  
 Boateng 
 , Pratte, J.A. states that what the court must determine is whether the change in country circumstances is such that the applicant, 'at the time his claim is being decided, has good grounds to fear persecution in the future'. Surely it could not be objectively determined that an applicant's grounds to fear persecution in the future no longer exist unless the change in circumstances, as evaluated at the time of the Board hearing, is significant, effective and durable. It follows that, at the very least, in most situations, some reasonable period of time must go by in order to permit the trier of facts to assess the changing conditions and their consequences, if any. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [7] 
  Nadon, J., goes further to reject the view expressed by Reed, J., in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) that the degree of proof is necessarily higher in a cessation case then in the case such as that before me where the application is for Convention refugee status. In this respect I am also in agreement with Nadon, J.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  In the case before me, the CRDD, in the portion of its decision quoted above refers to a "... concrete plan of action" disclosed by the documentary evidence which has already resulted in some change. The CRDD also acknowledges the likelihood of "... isolated incidents of violence ..." and the indications of the documentary evidence "... that right wing death squads will attempt to derail the peace process." While the evidence cited by the CRDD may disclose a concrete plan, I conclude that, only some five weeks after the implementation of the accord, it falls far short of demonstrating fundamental and significant, effective and durable change.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  I therefore conclude that the finding against the applicant on the basis of changed country circumstances cannot stand. Since the CRDD made no determination as to the validity of the applicant's claim in the absence of changed country circumstances that would warrant rejecting this application, I have set aside the decision and referred the applicant's claim back to the CRDD for rehearing and redetermination taking into account these reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Kane, J.
: The applicant, Ms Manpreet Kaur Gharialia, is a citizen of India who seeks permanent resident status in Canada pursuant to the Federal Skilled Workers [FSW] program in the category of General Practitioners and Family Physicians (NOC 3112).
[2]
The applicant now seeks judicial review pursuant to section 72 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the
Act
], of the decision of a Visa Officer [the Officer] at the High Commission of Canada in New Delhi, India made on June 13, 2012, which determined that she did not meet the requirements for permanent resident status in Canada as a Federal Skilled Worker pursuant to subsections 87.3 (2) and (3) of the
Act.
[3]
The Officer assessed the application, including the criteria for age, education, official languages, experience, arranged employment and adaptability and attributed a total of 72 points. Although the minimum number of points required is 67 and the applicant exceeded this minimum threshold, the Officer applied subsection 76(3) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 [the
Regulations
] to conduct a substituted evaluation of the likelihood of the ability of the applicant to become economically established in Canada. Following the substituted evaluation, the Officer concluded that he was not satisfied that the applicant had that ability. The Officer noted that the letters regarding the job offers for the applicant and her husband were not supported by an Arranged Employment Offer. The Officer also noted that the settlement funds available would be insufficient to support the applicant and her family over the long term in the likelihood that she would not be able to become economically established.
[4]
The CAIPS notes, which document the Officer's concerns and the responses of the applicant to two procedural fairness letters, confirm that the substituted evaluation was reviewed by a second officer who concurred, which is a requirement of subsection 76(3).
[5]
The first procedural fairness letter sent to the applicant sought to clarify whether the applicant was relying on NOC 3112, general practitioners and family physicians, or NOC 3123, other professional occupations in health diagnosing and treating. It was clarified that the applicant was relying on the NOC for general practitioners and her application was assessed accordingly. The second procedural fairness letter noted the Officer's concerns that the applicant's qualifications and experience were in Ayurvedic medicine, and that she would not be able to practise this type of medicine in Canada. The Officer's notes indicate that because Ayurvedic doctors are not licensed to practise in Canada he was not satisfied that she would be able to become economically established. In response, the applicant submitted additional information noting that there was no requirement for the applicant to work as a doctor in Canada, and provided various references to Ayurvedic courses and existing practitioners in Canada. The response also included two job offer letters, one for the applicant at a clinic where she could work as a consultant and the other for the applicant's spouse at a community newspaper.
[6]
The CAIPS notes indicate that the Officer considered the additional documents and the response to the procedural fairness letter. The Officer noted that none of the documents provided regarding Ayurvedic medicine establish that the institutions are regulated by provincial authorities or that the applicant's current qualifications would meet the requirements to practise in any kind of medical field in Canada. With respect to the two job offer letters, the Officer noted that they were not supported by Approved Employment Opinions [AEO] and remarked: "I do not find them credible". After reviewing the other material, the Officer concluded that none of it assuaged his concerns about the applicant's ability to become economically established in Canada.
The Issues
[7]
The applicant submits that there was a breach of procedural fairness because the Officer found the job offer letters to not be credible yet did not provide an opportunity for the applicant to respond to this finding. The applicant also submits that the Officer's decision was not reasonable because: the Officer unreasonably conducted a substituted evaluation; the Officer unreasonably discounted the job offers because they were not supported by an AEO; the Officer unreasonably relied on the lack of licensing of Ayurvedic medicine, which is not a NOC requirement, in his assessment; and, the Officer unreasonably concluded that the applicant could not establish herself economically in Canada despite the settlement funds available along with the proposed income from the job offers. The applicant also submits that there is no requirement under the FSW program that an applicant work in the field for which they are eligible upon arrival in Canada. Therefore, the Officer erred in relying on the fact that the applicant would not be able to practise as a physician in Canada as this was an irrelevant consideration.
[8]
The respondent submits that it was reasonable for the Officer to consider whether the applicant would be able to use her skills as an Ayurvedic doctor in Canada in the context of assessing her ability to become economically established. The respondent also submits that it was within the Officer's discretion to conduct a substituted evaluation, that he had a valid reason for doing so, and that the evaluation was consistent with the requirements of the
Act
. Given that the applicant's skills and experience were those of a physician, it was logical for the Officer to assess whether the applicant could work in the medical field.
[9]
The respondent submits that although the Officer used the phrase "[n]one of the documents provided
prove beyond doubt
that these institutions are regulated by provincial authorities nor that the applicant's current qualifications would meet the requirements for practice in any kind of medical field in Canada" [my emphasis], the Officer was not importing a higher criminal standard of proof in his assessment of the capacity of the applicant to work in Canada.
[10]
The respondent also submits that the Officer's notes which indicate, "The offers of employment from Voice Group and Ojus Healthcare to the applicant's spouse and the applicant are not supported by AEOs. Therefore, I do not find them to be credible", is not a finding that the documents are not authentic. Rather, the Officer was simply not satisfied that the offers responded to his concern about economic establishment. The respondent submits that the mere use of the term 'credible' should not trigger a procedural fairness issue.
Standard of review
[11]
The Officer's decision with respect to the applicant's eligibility for permanent resident status pursuant to the FSW class requires the Officer to assess the application and exercise his discretion and is, therefore, reviewable on a reasonableness standard:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[12]
Both the applicant and respondent referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 606 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] which also dealt with a refusal of a FSW applicant. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Tremblay-Lamer noted the appropriate standard of review at para 7:
[7] Determining whether or not an applicant has demonstrated his or her ability to become economically established as per the requirements of the
IRPA
and the
Regulations
is a very fact-driven exercise. This is an area in which immigration officers have significant experience, if not expertise. As such, the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  described the reasonableness standard as being "concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
[13]
If an issue of procedural fairness arises, it is reviewable on a correctness standard:
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 434 at para 43.
Procedural Fairness
a) Did the Officer breach the duty of procedural fairness by not raising his concerns that the letters of employment were not supported by an AEO and providing an opportunity for the applicant to respond?
[14]
As submitted by the applicant, there is no requirement that the job letters be supported by an AEO.
[15]
The applicant notes that the job letters were on letterhead, contact information for the employer and web addresses for the businesses were provided, and the letters were signed. The applicant submits that the Officer's finding that the letters were not "credible" was unreasonable and, moreover, this finding should have triggered a further opportunity for the applicant to respond.
[16]
In the recent decision,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] FCJ No 284, Justice Bédard considered the issue of procedural fairness to an applicant seeking permanent resident status as a FSW. Justice Bédard extensively reviewed the applicable case law and provided a summary of the relevant principles: the onus falls on the applicant to establish that they meet the requirements of the
Regulations
by providing sufficient evidence in support of their application; the duty of procedural fairness owed by visa officers is at the low-end of the spectrum; there is no obligation on a visa officer to notify the applicant of the deficiencies in the application or the supporting documents; and, there is no obligation on the visa officer to provide the applicant with an opportunity to address any concerns of the officer when the supporting documents are incomplete, unclear or insufficient to satisfy the officer that the applicant meets the requirements.
[17]
Justice Bédard also noted that, as determined in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FC), an officer may have a duty to provide the applicant with an opportunity to respond to the officer's concerns when such concerns arise from the credibility, veracity, or authenticity of the documents rather than from the sufficiency of the evidence.
[18]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 714, Justice O'Keefe considered the circumstances that give rise to a duty of procedural fairness and noted:
21 The case law specifies that a visa officer is not under a duty to inform an applicant about any concerns regarding the application which arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
22 However, a visa officer is obligated to inform an applicant of any concerns
related to the veracity of documents
and will be required to make further inquires (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 24).
23 The onus is always on the principal applicant to satisfy the visa officer of all parts of his application. The officer is under no obligation to ask for additional information where the principal applicant's material is insufficient (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCTD) (QL) at paragraph 6).
[19]
The applicant also relies on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] FCJ No 1779 to argue that the Officer's concerns about the employment letters give rise to a breach of procedural fairness.
[20]
However, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice O'Keefe found that the officer's concerns were clearly related to the credibility of the letters, i.e. their authenticity, because the letters were allegedly copied directly from the NOC description and were not properly certified. As noted at paras 18-19:
[18] The visa officer was concerned that two of the letters provided by the applicant quoted directly from the duties listed in NOC 3214 (clinical perfusionist). As a result, the visa officer decided that the documents were not credible, nor was the applicant's training and work experience. While it is true that the visa officer did raise some concerns about the applicant's training and experience at the interview, he did not give the applicant an opportunity to respond to his specific concerns about the veracity of the letters, nor did he make further inquiries to determine whether or not the letters were valid. The cross-examination of the visa officer established that he was not certain that the certification stamp on the letters applied only to the translation. The issue of the certification on the letters should have been verified.
[19] I am of the opinion that the visa officer made reviewable errors in failing to make further inquiries and in failing to apprise the applicant of his belief before deciding that the documents were not credible. This is consistent with the jurisprudence in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), 2001 FCT 904, where Lemieux J. stated at paragraph 5:
Moreover, the visa officer rejected documentary evidence proving she had worked as a cook in a restaurant in Vietnam because it was not on letterhead and was handwritten. I find that a rejection of documentary proof on this basis, without more verification to be unreasonable.
[21]
In the present case, although the Officer noted that he did not find the job offer letters credible, I agree with the respondent that the Officer was using that term loosely and that it was not a finding that the letters were not authentic. The Officer considered whether the job letters satisfied him regarding the applicant's ability to become economically established and concluded that they did not.
[22]
Although the Officer referred to the absence of an AEO, the job offer letters had not been provided with the initial application for the purpose of the points assessment. The job letters were provided in response to a procedural fairness letter after the Officer had assessed the application and attributed 72 points, yet still had concerns about the applicant's ability to become economically established in Canada. When the CAIPS notes are considered as a whole, the reference to the absence of an AEO appears to be related to the Officer's overall assessment of whether these job letters respond to his concern about the applicant's ability to become economically established.
[23]
The Officer had provided two earlier procedural fairness letters, the second of which alerted the applicant of his concerns with her ability to become economically established. The onus was on the applicant to provide sufficient supporting documentation to address these concerns. The letters, along with the other information about Ayurvedic practitioners and courses in Canada, did not, in the words of the Officer, assuage his concerns. In other words, the letters and other information were insufficient to satisfy the Officer.
[24]
There was no breach of procedural fairness.
b) Was it reasonable for the Officer to conduct a substituted evaluation and was that substituted evaluation reasonable?
[25]
The applicant raises several grounds to argue that there was no justification for the Officer to conduct a substituted evaluation or for the Officer's determination following the substituted evaluation.
[26]
The Officer's authority to consider a substituted evaluation pursuant to subsection 76(3) is an exceptional discretion.
[27]
Subsection 76(3) of the
Regulations
provides:
Whether or not the skilled worker has been awarded the minimum number of required points referred to in subsection (2), an officer may substitute for the criteria set out in paragraph (1)(
a
) their evaluation of the likelihood of the ability of the skilled worker to become economically established in Canada if the number of points awarded is not a sufficient indicator of whether the skilled worker may become economically established in Canada.
[28]
The wording of the provision is clear that an officer may substitute an assessment of points for other criteria where the points are insufficient to determine whether the applicant can integrate economically in Canada.
[29]
The jurisprudence supports the clear wording of the subsection and highlights that an officer's decision to undertake a substituted evaluation is entitled to deference.
[30]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 549, Justice de Montigny noted:
16 The discretion under subsection 76(3) of the IRPR is clearly exceptional and applies only in cases where the points awarded are not a sufficient indicator of whether the skilled worker will become economically established. The fact that the applicant or even this court would have weighed the factors differently is not a sufficient ground for judicial review.
[31]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 46 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], Justice Lagacé made similar comments:
14 The discretion under subsection 76(3) of the Regulations is clearly exceptional to cases where the points awarded are not a sufficient indicator of whether the skilled worker will become economically established. This decision is entitled to deference and the fact that that the applicant or the Court would have weighed the factors differently is not a ground for judicial review ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paras. 34-39;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2005 FC 1167, paras. 4-5, 8).
[32]
The applicant and respondent both relied on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 1834 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], but for different propositions. In that case, Justice Mandamin canvassed the application of subsection 76(3), noting that:
[17] Section 76(3) engages a two stage process for arriving at a substituted evaluation: first, the visa officer must decide if the s. 76(1) assessment is not a sufficient indicator of whether the skilled worker applicant may become economically established in Canada; second, the visa officer must evaluate the likelihood of the skilled worker becoming economically established in Canada by conducting an adequate substitute assessment on proper grounds.
...
[31] It seems to me that when visa officers substitute their evaluation on the ability of a skilled worker to become economically established in Canada under s. 76(3), that substituted evaluation must be comparable to the s. 76(1) evaluation they are displacing. I say this because s. 76(1) is structured as directed to a systematic objective assessment process designed to achieve consistency in the processing of skilled worker applications. The process for substituted evaluations should not displace the underlying intent to achieve a consistent process for assessing skilled worker applications.
[32] The opening words of s. 76(3), "
Whether or not
the skilled worker has been awarded the minimum number of required points ..." clearly indicates that the substituted evaluation may result in a negative substituted evaluation as well as in a positive substitute evaluation. Substituted evaluations are a procedure that introduces an element of flexibility into the skilled worker application process. It allows for acceptance of applicants who may not succeed under the initial assessment where there is good reason and for screening out applicants who pass the initial assessment but ought not be accepted for valid reasons.
[33] The substituted evaluation is a decision made by a visa officer in keeping with the officer's knowledge and expertise and is a decision under which deference is due. The officer must make a substituted evaluation decision which is consistent with IRPA, the Regulations and the thrust of the skilled worker provisions.
[33]
Justice Mandamin also noted at para 35 that the current
Regulations
do not require the applicant to work in the designated NOC occupation, just as the applicant submitted in the present case:
[35] The revisions to the
Regulations
changed the approach in skilled worker applications from an occupation-specific approach to a broader approach which gave more emphasis to adaptability by skilled worker applicants to become economically established in Canada.
[34]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant had applied under the NOC governing teachers. Justice Mandamin found that although the officer had referred to Ms Roohi's teaching opportunities, he was satisfied that the officer assessed the application on the broader standard of the likelihood of becoming economically established in Canada and reasonably concluded that the applicant would not.
[35]
Similarly in the present case, the Officer referred to the applicant's ability to practise as a physician in Canada but his assessment of economic establishment was broader. It was logical for the Officer to consider the applicant's ability to use her skills and experience as a physician as these were the skills she could be expected to rely on for employment.
[36]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1110, Justice Phelan considered whether the officer's decision to conduct a substituted evaluation was reasonable and whether the decision as a whole, based on the substituted evaluation, was reasonable. The applicant had argued that the availability of settlement funds made the reliance on a substituted evaluation unreasonable. Justice Phelan noted:
[13] This argument must be dismissed on two grounds. Firstly, the Visa Officer was aware of those funds and secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the matter of settlement funds was irrelevant to the Visa Officer's decision.
[14] The settlement funds were irrelevant for two reasons. Firstly, the decision did not turn on the Applicant's ability to establish himself financially based on funds available but on whether the medical qualifications to practice would be accepted. Secondly, settlement funds are no longer relevant to a consideration of whether to exercise a discretion to make a substitute evaluation.
[15] As held by Justice Zinn in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  section 76 of the Regulations was amended to provide that when an officer makes a substitute evaluation of a likelihood to become economically established, the officer does so in lieu of the usual criteria of points earned and available settlement funds. Therefore, the Applicant's settlement funds are irrelevant if the exercise of discretion to substitute is sustainable.
[37]
Although there is no requirement for an applicant to work in the NOC field for which they may be eligible to come to Canada, these were the skills that the applicant would likely rely on to make a living. The Officer was, therefore, justified in his belief that because the applicant would not be able to practise in Canada, the points did not adequately reflect the applicant's ability to become economically established. The Officer had a valid reason to turn to a substituted evaluation and he reasonably exercised his discretion to do so.
[38]
The Officer's consideration of the fact that Ayurvedic medicine was not regulated in Canada was relevant to the ability of the applicant to use her skills and experience as a physician to make a living.
[39]
The Officer's note that none of the documents provided "
prove beyond doubt
that these institutions are regulated by provincial authorities nor that the applicant's current qualifications would meet the requirements for practice in any kind of medical field in Canada" [my emphasis], may again have been a poor choice of words. When the reasons are read as a whole however, there is nothing to suggest that the Officer was demanding a higher standard of proof; the Officer assessed all of the information and weighed the considerations.
[40]
With respect to the applicant's submission that the Officer unreasonably discounted or ignored the settlement funds, I do not agree. The Officer had taken the settlement funds into account in his assessment of the application pursuant to subsection 76(1). In the substituted evaluation pursuant to subsection 76(3), the Officer again noted the settlement funds but found that these funds would be insufficient to offer long-term support for her family, which included the applicant's spouse and two dependent children of university age, if economic establishment did not occur. As noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the fact that there are settlement funds is not determinative of the issue of economic establishment.
[41]
An officer is not limited in his consideration of factors pursuant to subsection 76(3), although, as noted by Justice Mandamin in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it should bear some link to the criteria in order to aim for consistency. It must be "consistent with IRPA, the Regulations and the thrust of the skilled worker provisions".
[42]
In the present case, the Officer's substituted evaluation of the applicant's ability to become economically established was both linked to the criteria and broader than the criteria set out in subsection 76(1). The Officer again considered the applicant's educational qualifications, experience as an Ayurvedic doctor, the lack of regulation of Ayurvedic doctors in Canada, prospects of employment in Canada, dependents and the settlement funds.
[43]
In this case, based on the substituted evaluation, the Officer reasonably concluded that the applicant would not be economically established in Canada. As noted by Justice Tremblay-Lamer  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
immigration officers have significant experience in conducting these fact-driven assessments and their decisions warrant deference. In the present case, the Officer's decision is reasonable.
Proposed Certified Question
[44]
The applicants proposed the following question for certification in the event that this Court were to determine that the applicant's intention and ability to practise as a doctor is relevant and significant to the assessment of subsection 76(3) of the
Regulations
:
In assessing an application for permanent residence within the Federal Skilled Worker class, pursuant to sections 75 through 81 and 83 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) and the Ministerial Instructions issued under section 87(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), is it required that the applicant intend or be able to practice in the profession for which he or she has been found eligible for processing under section 75 of the IRPR?
[45]
The respondent agrees with the applicant that there is no requirement that an applicant for a FSW visa be employed in the NOC category which they applied or are eligible. The respondent notes that the officer considered the applicant's ability to work as a physician, in addition to other factors, in determining whether she would be able to become economically established. The proposed question will not be determinative of the appeal because the assessment of economic establishment is fact-specific.
[46]
As I indicated above, and as noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , there is no requirement for the applicant to work in the field in which they are eligible under a NOC. The intention of the provisions is to permit applicants, once eligible, to work in a range of occupations to respond to changes in the labour market.
[47]
In this case, the Officer assessed the applicant's ability to become economically established taking into account several factors, including her ability to practice medicine given her current occupation, education, skills and experience. The Officer's decision is not based on a finding that the applicant must work in the particular NOC field.
[48]
The proposed question need not be certified.
JUDGMENT
[49]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed;
2. No question is certified
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demanderesse, Mme Manpreet Kaur Gharialia, est une citoyenne de l'Inde qui sollicite le statut de résidente permanente au Canada dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) [PTQF], dans la profession des omnipraticiens/omnipraticiennes et médecins en médecine familiale (CNP 3112).
[2]
La demanderesse sollicite maintenant le contrôle judiciaire, en vertu du paragraphe 72 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la Loi], de la décision du 13 juin 2012 par laquelle un agent des visas [l'agent] du Haut-commissariat du Canada à New Delhi, en Inde, a déterminé qu'elle ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences d'admissibilité au statut de résidente permanente dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral), selon ce qui est mentionné aux paragraphes 87.3(2) et (3) de la Loi.
[3]
Au terme de son évaluation des critères établis pour l'âge, les études, la compétence dans les langues officielles, l'expérience, l'exercice d'un emploi réservé et la capacité d'adaptation, l'agent a attribué un score de 72 points à la demande. Bien que le score obtenu soit supérieur au minimum de 67 points, l'agent a appliqué le paragraphe 76(3) du
Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-227 [le Règlement], pour substituer aux critères son appréciation de l'aptitude de la demanderesse à réussir son établissement économique au Canada. Suivant son appréciation de substitution, l'agent a conclu qu'il n'était pas convaincu que la demanderesse avait cette aptitude. L'agent a noté que les lettres d'offre d'emploi de la demanderesse et de son mari n'étaient étayées d'aucun avis d'emploi réservé. L'agent a également noté que les fonds d'établissement ne seraient pas suffisants pour soutenir la demanderesse et sa famille à long terme dans l'éventualité où la demanderesse n'arrivait pas à réussir son établissement économique.
[4]
Les notes du STIDI, qui font état des préoccupations de l'agent et des réponses de la demanderesse à deux lettres d'équité procédurale, confirment que l'appréciation de substitution a été revue par un autre agent qui y a souscrit, comme le prévoit le paragraphe 76(4).
[5]
La première lettre d'équité procédurale envoyée à la demanderesse visait à déterminer si elle se fondait sur le code 3112 de la CNP, omnipraticiens/omnipraticiennes et médecins en médecine familiale, ou le code 3123 de la CNP, autres professionnels/professionnelles en diagnostic et en traitement de la santé. Il a été précisé que la demanderesse se fondait sur le code relatif aux omnipraticiens et sa demande a été examinée à ce titre. Dans la seconde lettre d'équité procédurale, on apprend que l'agent est préoccupé par le fait que la demanderesse a des compétences et une expérience en médecine ayurvédique, et qu'il doute qu'elle ne puisse exercer ce genre de médecine au Canada. Dans ses notes, l'agent mentionne que, parce que les docteurs en médecine ayurvédique ne se voient pas décerner un permis de pratique au Canada, il n'est pas convaincu que la demanderesse serait apte à réussir son établissement économique. En réponse à cette lettre, la demanderesse a fourni des renseignements supplémentaires selon lesquels rien ne l'obligeait à travailler comme médecin au Canada, en plus de diverses références à des cours et à des personnes qui exercent la profession au Canada. La demanderesse a également joint à sa réponse deux lettres d'offre d'emploi, la première venant d'une clinique où elle pourrait travailler en tant qu'experte-conseil, et l'autre d'un journal communautaire à l'intention de son mari.
[6]
Selon les notes inscrites dans le STIDI, l'agent a pris en considération les documents supplémentaires et la réponse à la lettre d'équité procédurale. L'agent a noté qu'aucun des documents concernant la médecine ayurvédique n'établit que les établissements en question sont réglementés par des autorités provinciales ou que les compétences de la demanderesse lui permettraient de pratiquer dans un domaine médical, quel qu'il soit, au Canada. Eu égard aux deux lettres d'offre d'emploi, l'agent fait remarquer que celles-ci ne sont pas étayées d'avis relatifs à un emploi réservé (AER) et ajoute [traduction] « elles ne sont pas crédibles selon moi ». Après examen des autres documents, l'agent a conclu qu'aucun d'entre eux n'atténuait ses doutes quant à l'aptitude de la demanderesse à réussir son établissement économique au Canada.
Questions en litige
[7]
La demanderesse fait valoir qu'il y a eu manquement à l'équité procédurale, étant donné que l'agent a conclu que les lettres d'offre d'emploi n'étaient pas crédibles, sans toutefois donner à la demanderesse l'occasion de fournir une réponse à cette conclusion. La demanderesse affirme en outre que la décision de l'agent n'était pas raisonnable parce que: l'agent a déraisonnablement fait une nouvelle appréciation; l'agent a déraisonnablement écarté les offres d'emploi parce qu'elles n'étaient pas étayées d'un AER; dans son évaluation, l'agent s'est déraisonnablement fondé sur le fait que la médecine ayurvédique ne fait pas l'objet d'une autorisation de pratique, laquelle n'est pas une exigence eu égard à la CNP; l'agent a déraisonnablement conclu que la demanderesse ne pourrait s'établir économiquement au Canada, en dépit des fonds d'établissement dont elle dispose et de la rémunération proposée dans les offres d'emplois. La demanderesse fait aussi valoir que le programme des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) n'exige pas que le demandeur travaille dans le domaine pour lequel il a été jugé admissible à son arrivée au Canada. Par conséquent, l'agent a commis une erreur en se fondant sur le fait, non pertinent, que la demanderesse ne pourrait pratiquer la médecine au Canada.
[8]
Le défendeur affirme qu'il était raisonnable de la part de l'agent de se demander si les compétences de la demanderesse en médecine ayurvédique lui seraient utiles au Canada afin de déterminer son aptitude à s'établir économiquement au Canada. Le défendeur fait également valoir que l'agent avait la compétence de faire une appréciation de substitution, qu'il avait une bonne raison de le faire, et que l'appréciation était conforme aux exigences de la Loi. Étant donné que les compétences et l'expérience de la demanderesse étaient liées à la médecine, il était logique de la part de l'agent de se demander si la demanderesse pourrait travailler dans ce domaine.
[9]
Le défendeur fait valoir que même si l'agent a affirmé que [traduction] « [a]ucun des documents présentés ne
prouve hors de tout doute
que ces établissements sont réglementés par des autorités provinciales ou que les compétences de la demanderesse lui permettraient de pratiquer dans un domaine médical, quel qu'il soit, au Canada » [non souligné dans l'original], il n'a pas introduit de norme de preuve supérieure associée au droit pénal dans son évaluation de l'aptitude de la demanderesse à travailler au Canada.
[10]
Le défendeur affirme en outre que la note de l'agent selon laquelle [traduction] « [l]es offres d'emploi faites par Voice Group et Ojus Healthcare à l'époux de la demanderesse et à la demanderesse ne sont pas étayées d'AER. Par conséquent, elles ne sont pas crédibles selon moi » ne signifie pas que les documents ne sont pas authentiques, mais plutôt que l'agent n'est tout simplement pas convaincu que les offres dissipent ses doutes quant à l'établissement économique. Le défendeur fait valoir que le simple fait d'employer le terme « crédible » ne suffit pas à soulever une question d'équité procédurale.
Norme de contrôle
[11]
Pour rendre une décision eu égard à l'admissibilité de la demanderesse au statut de résidente permanent dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral), l'agent doit examiner la demande et exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire, de sorte que la décision est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la raisonnabilité:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].

Tant la demanderesse que le défendeur ont fait référence à
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 606 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], qui traite également du refus d'une demande dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral). Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 7, la juge Tremblay-Lamer a mentionné la norme de contrôle appropriée:
[7] Répondre à la question de savoir si un demandeur a démontré qu'il pouvait réussir son établissement économique, conformément aux exigences de la LIPR et du Règlement, est un exercice essentiellement factuel. Il s'agit d'un domaine dans lequel les agents d'immigration ont une grande expérience, voire une expertise. Par conséquent, la norme de contrôle appropriée est la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47, affirmait, au sujet de la norme de la raisonnabilité, qu'elle « tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».
[13]
Si une question d'équité procédurale est soulevée, celle-ci est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision correcte:
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 434, par. 43.
Équité procédurale
a) L'agent a-t-il manqué à son devoir d'équité procédurale en ne mentionnant pas qu'il était préoccupé par le fait que les lettres d'emploi n'étaient pas étayées d'un AER et en ne donnant pas à la demanderesse l'occasion de fournir une réponse?
[14]
Comme l'a mentionné la demanderesse, les lettres d'emploi ne doivent pas nécessairement être étayées d'un AER.
[15]
La demanderesse souligne que les lettres d'emploi étaient imprimées sur du papier à en-tête, que les coordonnées de l'employeur et les adresses Web des entreprises y figuraient, et qu'elles étaient signées. La demanderesse affirme qu'il était déraisonnable de la part de l'agent de conclure que les lettres n'étaient pas « crédibles », et qu'elle aurait dû avoir l'occasion de fournir d'autres explications en réponse à cette conclusion.
[16]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2013] ACF no 284, la juge Bédard s'est penchée sur la question de l'équité procédurale dans le cas d'un demandeur sollicitant le statut de résident permanent dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral). La juge Bédard a fait un examen exhaustif de la jurisprudence applicable et résume les principes pertinents: il incombe au demandeur d'établir qu'il répond aux exigences du Règlement en fournissant des éléments de preuve suffisants à l'appui de sa demande; l'obligation d'équité procédurale dont doivent s'acquitter les agents des visas se trouve à l'extrémité inférieure du spectre; l'agent n'est pas tenu d'aviser le demandeur des lacunes relevées dans les documents fournis à l'appui de sa demande; l'agent des visas n'est pas tenu de donner l'occasion au demandeur ou à la demanderesse de dissiper ses préoccupations lorsque les documents présentés à l'appui d'une demande sont obscurs, incomplets ou insuffisants pour permettre de convaincre l'agent que le demandeur se conforme à toutes les exigences.
[17]
La juge Bédard a en outre souligné que, comme il est établi dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF), l'obligation de l'agent de donner au demandeur la possibilité de répondre à ses préoccupations peut s'appliquer si ses doutes sont liés à la crédibilité, à la véracité ou à l'authenticité des documents, plutôt qu'au caractère suffisant de la preuve.
[18]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 714, le juge O'Keefe s'est penché sur les circonstances qui font naître une obligation d'équité procédurale et souligne:
21 Il appert de la jurisprudence que l'agent des visas n'est pas tenu d'informer le demandeur des réserves qu'il a au sujet de la demande lorsque ces réserves découlent directement des exigences de la législation ou des règlements (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 24).
22 Cependant, l'agent des visas est tenu d'informer le demandeur de ses réserves concernant la véracité des documents et devra faire des recherches plus approfondies (voir la décision
Hassani,
précitée, au paragraphe 24).
23 Il appartient toujours au demandeur principal d'établir le bien-fondé de tous les aspects de sa demande auprès de l'agent des visas. L'agent n'est pas tenu de demander des renseignements supplémentaires lorsque la preuve du demandeur principal est insuffisante (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1re inst.) (QL), au paragraphe 6).
[19]
La demanderesse invoque également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] ACF no 1779, pour affirmer que les préoccupations de l'agent concernant les lettres d'emploi entraînent un manquement à l'équité procédurale.
[20]
Toutefois, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge O'Keefe a conclu que les préoccupations de l'agent étaient clairement liées à la crédibilité des lettres, ou leur authenticité, parce qu'elles reprenaient textuellement la description contenue dans la CNP et n'étaient pas certifiées comme il se doit, semble-t-il. Comme il est mentionné aux paragraphes 18 et 19:
[18] L'agent des visas était préoccupé par le fait que deux des lettres fournies par le demandeur reprenaient textuellement les fonctions énumérées à la catégorie 3214 de la CNP (perfusionniste cardio-vasculaire). Il a par conséquent conclu que ces documents n'étaient pas dignes de foi, et qu'il en était de même des renseignements touchant la formation et l'expérience de travail du demandeur. Même s'il est vrai que l'agent des visas a exprimé quelques réserves au sujet de la formation et de l'expérience du demandeur lors de l'entrevue, il n'a ni donné au demandeur la possibilité de répondre aux réserves particulières qu'il avait concernant l'authenticité des lettres, ni essayé d'obtenir des renseignements additionnels pour déterminer si les lettres étaient authentiques. Le contre-interrogatoire de l'agent des visas a permis de démontrer qu'il n'était pas sûr si le cachet de certification ne visait que la traduction. La question de la certification de l'authenticité des lettres aurait dû faire l'objet d'une vérification.
[19] Je suis d'avis que l'agent des visas a commis des erreurs susceptibles de contrôle en omettant d'obtenir des renseignements supplémentaires et en omettant d'informer le demandeur des doutes qui l'ont amené à conclure que les documents n'étaient pas dignes de foi. Ceci est compatible avec la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F 1reinst.), 2001 CFPI 904, dans laquelle le juge Lemieux a dit ce qui suit au paragraphe 5:
De plus, l'agente des visas a rejeté un élément de preuve documentaire établissant que la demanderesse avait travaillé comme cuisinière dans un restaurant du Vietnam, parce que l'attestation n'était pas sur papier à en-tête et qu'elle était manuscrite. Je conclus que le rejet d'un élément de preuve documentaire pour ces seules raisons, sans autre vérification, est déraisonnable.
[21]
En l'espèce, bien que l'agent ait mentionné que les lettres d'emploi n'étaient pas crédibles selon lui, je suis d'accord avec le défendeur pour dire que l'agent a employé ce terme au sens large, et que cela ne voulait pas dire qu'il doutait de l'authenticité des lettres. L'agent s'est penché sur la question de savoir si les lettres d'emploi le convainquaient quant à l'aptitude de la demanderesse à s'établir économiquement, et il a conclu que non.
[22]
Bien que l'agent ait mentionné l'absence d'un AER, les lettres d'offre d'emploi n'avaient pas été jointes à la demande initiale en vue de l'attribution des points. Les lettres d'emploi ont été fournies en réponse à une lettre d'équité procédurale envoyée après que l'agent a évalué la demande, lui a attribué 72 points et a dit avoir encore des doutes quant à l'aptitude de la demanderesse à réussir son établissement économique au Canada. Si l'on se penche sur les notes inscrites au STIDI dans leur ensemble, la référence à l'absence d'un AER semble être liée à l'évaluation générale que fait l'agent de la mesure dans laquelle les lettres d'emploi dissipent ses doutes quant à l'aptitude de la demanderesse à s'établir économiquement.
[23]
L'agent avait présenté deux lettres d'équité procédurale auparavant. Dans la seconde, il informait la demanderesse qu'il doutait de son aptitude à s'établir économiquement. Il incombait à la demanderesse de fournir les documents qui suffiraient à dissiper ces doutes. Les lettres et les autres renseignements fournis au sujet des personnes pratiquant la médecine ayurvédique et des cours connexes au Canada n'ont pas dissipé les doutes de l'agent, pour reprendre ses termes. Autrement dit, les lettres et les autres renseignements fournis n'ont pas suffi à convaincre l'agent.
[24]
Il n'y a pas eu de manquement à l'équité procédurale.
b) Était-il raisonnable de la part de l'agent de procéder à une appréciation de substitution, et cette appréciation était-elle raisonnable?
[25]
La demanderesse invoque plusieurs motifs pour lesquels l'appréciation de substitution faite par l'agent ou la décision découlant de cette appréciation n'était pas justifiée.
[26]
Le droit de substitution d'appréciation conféré à l'agent en vertu du paragraphe 76(3) est un pouvoir discrétionnaire exceptionnel.
[27]
Le paragraphe 76(3) du Règlement prévoit:
Si le nombre de points obtenu par un travailleur qualifié - que celui-ci obtienne ou non le nombre minimum de points visé au paragraphe (2) - n'est pas un indicateur suffisant de l'aptitude de ce travailleur qualifié à réussir son établissement économique au Canada, l'agent peut substituer son appréciation aux critères prévus à l'alinéa (1)
a
).
[28]
Le libellé de la disposition établit clairement que l'agent peut substituer d'autres critères au nombre de points lorsque ce dernier ne permet pas de trancher la question de savoir si le demandeur peut s'intégrer économiquement au Canada.
[29]
La jurisprudence appuie le libellé clair du paragraphe et fait ressortir que la décision de l'agent de substituer son appréciation commande la retenue.
[30]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge de Montigny a affirmé ce qui suit:
16 Le pouvoir discrétionnaire conféré par le paragraphe 76(3) du Règlement ne s'applique qu'exceptionnellement lorsque le nombre de points accordé ne reflète pas l'aptitude du travailleur qualifié à réussir son établissement économique. Le fait que le demandeur ou même la Cour aurait évalué les facteurs différemment n'est pas un motif justifiant un contrôle judiciaire.
[31]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 46 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], le juge Lagacé a fait un commentaire similaire:
14 Le pouvoir discrétionnaire conféré par le paragraphe 76(3) du Règlement, de toute évidence, ne s'applique qu'exceptionnellement, lorsque le nombre de points accordés ne reflète pas l'aptitude du travailleur qualifié à réussir son établissement économique. Cette décision doit être traitée avec retenue et le fait que le demandeur ou la Cour aurait évalué les facteurs différemment ne suffit pas à fonder un contrôle judiciaire (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphes 34 à 39;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphes 4, 5 et 8).
[32]
La demanderesse et le défendeur invoquent tous deux
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 1834 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], mais pour différentes raisons. Dans sa décision, le juge Mandamin a affirmé, dans son analyse de l'application du paragraphe 76(3):
[17] Le paragraphe 76(3) comporte un processus en deux étapes afin d'arriver à une substitution de l'appréciation: premièrement, l'agent des visas doit décider si l'appréciation faite en vertu du paragraphe 76(1) ne reflète pas l'aptitude du travailleur qualifié à réussir son établissement économique au Canada; deuxièmement, l'agent des visas doit évaluer l'aptitude du travailleur qualifié à réussir son établissement économique au Canada en effectuant une substitution d'appréciation adéquate fondée sur des motifs légitimes.
[...]
[31] Il me semble que lorsqu'un agent des visas substitue son appréciation, en vertu du paragraphe 76(3), quant à l'aptitude d'un travailleur qualifié à réussir son établissement économique au Canada, cette substitution d'appréciation doit être comparable à l'évaluation faite en vertu du paragraphe 76(1) que l'agent remplace. J'affirme ceci parce que le paragraphe 76(1) est structuré comme un processus d'appréciation objective systématique visant à assurer la cohérence dans le traitement des demandes présentées au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés. Le processus de substitution de l'appréciation ne devrait pas supplanter l'intention sous-jacente d'assurer un processus uniforme d'appréciation des demandes présentées au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés.
[32] Le préambule du paragraphe 76(3) est ainsi libellé: « Si le nombre de points obtenu par un travailleur qualifié - que celui-ci obtienne ou non le nombre minimum de points visé au paragraphe (2) [...] ». Ce préambule indique clairement que la substitution d'appréciation peut être une substitution d'appréciation défavorable tout comme une substitution d'appréciation favorable. Les substitutions d'appréciation sont une procédure qui introduit un élément de souplesse dans le processus de demande à titre de travailleur qualifié. Elles permettent, lorsqu'il y a de bonnes raisons, l'acceptation de demandeurs qui ne seraient peut-être pas acceptés lors de l'appréciation initiale et le rejet de demandeurs qui ont passé l'appréciation initiale, mais qui ne devraient pas être acceptés pour des motifs valables.
[33] La substitution d'appréciation est une décision prise par un agent des visas en fonction de ses connaissances et de son expertise et celle-ci doit faire l'objet de retenue. L'agent doit prendre une décision de substitution d'appréciation qui est conforme à la LIPR, au Règlement et à l'objectif des dispositions relatives aux travailleurs qualifiés.
[33]
Le juge Mandamin a également mentionné, au paragraphe 35, qu'en vertu du Règlement actuel, le demandeur n'a pas à travailler dans la profession désignée de la CNP, tout comme le fait valoir la demanderesse en l'espèce:
[35] Les révisions au Règlement ont modifié la façon d'aborder les demandes présentées au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés, c'est-à-dire qu'on est passé d'une approche centrée sur l'emploi à une approche plus large qui insiste davantage sur la capacité des demandeurs au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés à réussir leur établissement économique au Canada.
[34] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Roohi
, la demanderesse avait présenté une demande à titre d'enseignante au sens de la CNP. Le juge Mandamin a affirmé être convaincu que, même s'il avait tenu compte des possibilités d'enseignement s'offrant à Mme Roohi, l'agent avait examiné la demande selon une approche plus large de la probabilité que la demanderesse s'établisse économiquement au Canada et avait conclu raisonnablement qu'elle ne réussirait pas.
[35]
De la même façon, en l'espèce, l'agent a mentionné la capacité de la demanderesse de pratiquer la médecine au Canada, mais son analyse de l'établissement économique était plus large. Il était logique de la part de l'agent de se pencher sur la capacité de la demanderesse de mettre à profit ses compétences et son expérience en tant que médecin, étant donné qu'on pouvait s'attendre à ce qu'elle s'appuie sur ces compétences pour trouver du travail.
[36]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 1110, le juge Phelan a examiné la question de savoir si la décision de l'agent de substituer son appréciation était raisonnable et si la décision découlant de cette appréciation était raisonnable dans son ensemble. Le demandeur avait fait valoir qu'en raison des fonds d'établissement qu'il avait à sa disposition, la substitution d'appréciation était déraisonnable. Le juge Phelan a expliqué:
[13] Cet argument doit être rejeté pour deux motifs. Premièrement, l'agent des visas avait connaissance de ces fonds et, deuxièmement, et de façon peut-être plus importante, la question des fonds d'établissement n'était pas pertinente quant à la décision de l'agent des visas.
[14] Les fonds d'établissement n'étaient pas pertinents pour deux raisons. Premièrement, la décision ne portait pas sur la capacité du demandeur de s'établir financièrement en fonction des fonds qu'il possédait, mais plutôt sur la question de savoir si ses qualifications médicales seraient acceptées. Deuxièmement, les fonds d'établissement ne sont plus pertinents quant à la décision d'un agent d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire d'effectuer une substitution d'appréciation.
[15] Comme le juge Zinn l'a conclu dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  l'article 76 du Règlement a été modifié afin de prévoir que, lorsqu'un agent effectue une substitution d'appréciation de la possibilité d'établissement économique, il le fait en remplacement des critères habituels de points obtenus et de fonds d'établissement disponibles. Par conséquent, les fonds d'établissement du demandeur ne sont pas pertinents si l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire était justifié.
[37]
Bien que le demandeur ne doive pas nécessairement travailler dans la profession de la CNP pour laquelle il pourrait être admis au Canada, on peut penser qu'il misera sur les compétences qui y correspondent pour gagner sa vie. Par conséquent, il était justifié de la part de l'agent de croire que, puisque la demanderesse ne pourrait exercer sa profession au Canada, le total des points ne reflétait pas adéquatement l'aptitude de la demanderesse à s'établir économiquement. L'agent avait une raison valable de recourir à une appréciation de substitution et il a raisonnablement exercé son pouvoir discrétionnaire à cet égard.
[38]
L'agent a tenu compte du fait que la médecine ayurvédique n'est pas une profession réglementée au Canada, ce qui est pertinent pour évaluer la capacité de la demanderesse à mettre à profit ses compétences et son expérience en tant que médecin pour gagner sa vie.
[39]
Lorsque l'agent souligne dans ses notes qu'aucun des documents présentés ne «
prouve hors de tout doute
que ces établissements sont réglementés par des autorités provinciales ou que les compétences de la demanderesse lui permettraient de pratiquer dans un domaine médical, quel qu'il soit, au Canada » [non souligné dans l'original], il choisit peut-être encore mal ses mots. Cela dit, à la lumière des motifs pris dans leur ensemble, rien ne permet de penser que l'agent réclamait une norme de preuve plus élevée; l'agent a examiné toute l'information et a soupesé les différents facteurs.
[40]
Je ne suis pas d'accord avec la demanderesse lorsqu'elle affirme que l'agent a déraisonnablement écarté ou omis de prendre en considération les fonds d'établissement. L'agent a tenu compte des fonds d'établissement dans son évaluation de la demande en vertu du paragraphe 76(1). Dans l'appréciation de substitution effectuée en vertu du paragraphe 76(3), l'agent souligne une nouvelle fois les fonds d'établissement, mais il affirme que ces fonds ne suffiraient pas à soutenir à long terme la famille de la demanderesse, qui comprend son époux et deux enfants à charge en âge d'étudier à l'université, dans l'éventualité où l'établissement économique ne se concrétisait pas. Comme il est mentionné dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la présence de fonds d'établissement n'est pas déterminante pour trancher la question de l'établissement économique.
[41]
L'agent n'est pas limité dans son appréciation des facteurs en vertu du paragraphe 76(3). Cela dit, comme l'a affirmé le juge Mandamin dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la décision devrait établir un certain lien avec les critères énoncés afin d'assurer un processus uniforme. Elle doit être « conforme à la LIPR, au Règlement et à l'objectif des dispositions relatives aux travailleurs qualifiés ».
[42]
En l'espèce, l'appréciation de substitution qu'a faite l'agent au sujet de l'aptitude de la demanderesse à s'établir économiquement reposait à la fois sur les critères énoncés au paragraphe 76(1) et sur d'autres critères. L'agent a une nouvelle fois tenu compte des études de la demanderesse et de son expérience à titre de docteur en médecine ayurvédique, de l'absence de cadre réglementaire pour la pratique de la médecine ayurvédique au Canada, des perspectives d'emploi au Canada, des personnes à charge et des fonds d'établissement.
[43]
Dans le cas qui nous intéresse, à la lumière de l'appréciation de substitution, l'agent a raisonnablement conclu que la demanderesse ne réussirait pas son établissement économique au Canada. Comme le souligne la juge Tremblay-Lamer dans
Philbean,
les agents d'immigration ont une grande expérience de ces évaluations factuelles et leurs décisions commandent la retenue. En l'espèce, la décision de l'agent est raisonnable.
Question proposée aux fins de certification
[44]
Le demandeur a proposé la question suivante pour certification dans l'éventualité où la Cour concluait que l'intention de la demanderesse et son aptitude à pratiquer la médecine sont pertinentes et importantes dans l'évaluation faite en vertu du paragraphe 76(3) du Règlement:
[TRADUCTION]
Dans l'évaluation de la demande de résidence permanente dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) en vertu des articles 75 à 81 et 83 du Règlement sur l'Immigration et la protection des réfugiés (RIPR) et de l'instruction donnée par le ministre en vertu de l'article 87.3 de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés (LIPR), le demandeur doit-il nécessairement avoir l'intention ou être en mesure d'exercer la profession pour laquelle sa demande a été trouvée recevable en vertu de l'article 75 du RIPR?
[45]
Le défendeur convient avec la demanderesse que pour obtenir un visa dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral), le demandeur ne doit pas nécessairement travailler dans la profession de la CNP qui est mentionnée dans la demande ou pour laquelle il est admissible. Le défendeur souligne que l'agent s'est penché sur la capacité de la demanderesse de travailler comme médecin, en plus d'autres facteurs, pour déterminer si elle parviendrait à s'établir économiquement. La question proposée ne sera pas déterminante quant à l'issue de l'appel, étant donné que l'évaluation de l'établissement économique est factuelle.
[46]
Comme je l'ai déjà souligné, et comme il est mentionné dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il n'est pas nécessaire que le demandeur exerce la profession de la CNP pour laquelle il est admissible. Les dispositions visent à permettre aux demandeurs, une fois que ceux-ci sont admissibles, de travailler dans différentes professions pour s'adapter à l'évolution du marché du travail.
[47]
En l'espèce, l'agent a évalué la capacité de la demanderesse à s'établir économiquement en tenant compte de plusieurs facteurs, dont sa capacité à pratiquer la médecine compte tenu de sa profession actuelle, des études qu'elle a faites, de ses compétences et de son expérience. La décision de l'agent n'est pas fondée sur la conclusion voulant que la demanderesse doive nécessairement travailler dans la profession particulière de la CNP.
[48]
La question proposée n'a pas à être certifiée.

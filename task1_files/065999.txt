Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2012] F.T.R. TBEd. AP.013.
[1]
Near, J.
: The Applicant, Varnan Paramanathan, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board), dated July 29, 2011. The Board found that he was not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA).
I.
Facts
[2]
The Applicant is a Tamil male from Jaffna in the North of Sri Lanka. However, he lived in Kotahena, Colombo for two years and two months before leaving the country.
[3]
He claimed that his family experienced harassment by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and then later by security forces. He described several short detentions during which he was interrogated and beaten prior to being released. The detentions occurred as follows:
• August 2007: After a LTTE ambush of the local army camp in Uduvil, he was detained along with other Tamils and held for 5 days during which time he was beaten and suffered injuries before his father negotiated his release
• July 2008: He was detained at the Omanthai checkpoint by the army when there to assist his uncle but was released after three hours
• August 2008: While living with his aunt in Colombo, he was detained and questioned for three days by CID (Criminal Investigation Division) agents before a retired police officer interceded for his release
• April 2009: He was caught up in a police round up and held in Kotahena, Colombo with other Tamils just prior to the end of the war, but his boss was able to have him released after two days
• July 2010: He was taken by the army, CID and Karuna paramilitaries from his aunt's house in Kotahena, Colombo and detained for three days at the Petteh army camp until a businessman hired by his aunt bribed police for his release
[4]
The Applicant claims that an agent helped him to fly out of Sri Lanka on September 9, 2010.
II.
Decision Under Review
[5]
The Board did not believe the Applicant's fear of persecution to be well-founded or that he faced a serious possibility of risk if he were to return to Sri Lanka. He was released from all detentions, albeit with the occasional bribe. The Board believed, on a balance of probabilities, that there was no warrant out for his arrest or that he was not on the high security watch list of the government.
[6]
The Board proceeded to analyze the change of circumstances in Sri Lanka. Having reviewed often less than consistent information, the Board found that the situation for Tamils in the country had improved significantly in the past two years. The government was seen as reaching out to the Tamil community by hiring more Tamils in the police and military. However, the Board acknowledged the continued prevalence of discrimination against ethnic minorities, specifically Tamils. Considering the totality of the evidence, the Board determined that "the situation, while not perfect, is not such that the Applicant would be persecuted due to any Convention ground or harmed pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA."
[7]
Finally, the risk facing the Applicant of extortion by rogue members of the security forces and Karuna paramilitaries was addressed. The Applicant expressed concern that on returning from a Western country he would be perceived as a potential wealthy target. The Board nonetheless concluded that any risk faced by the Applicant would be a generalized and prevalent risk faced by his sub-group and not captured by subsection 97(1)(b).
III.
Issues
[8]
The Applicant raises several issues that can be addressed as follows:
(a) Did the Board err by failing to consider an additional Convention ground?
(b) Did the Board err in the application of the legal test for assessing the Applicant's fear of persecution?
(c) Did the Board err by not considering the cumulative effect of the Applicant's detentions?
(d) Did the Board fail to consider the threat posed to the Applicant by paramilitaries?
(e) Did the Board err in making its credibility findings?
(f) Did the Board err in its assessment of the change of circumstances in Sri Lanka?
(g) Did the Board err by making misstatements?
IV.
Standard of Review
[9]
The majority of these issues require the reasonableness standard as matters of fact or mixed fact and law (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 51).
[10]
In applying that standard, the Court must have regard for "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility" as well as "whether the decision falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 47).
[11]
The application of a legal test is, however, a matter of law that must be reviewed based on correctness (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 50;
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 44).
V.
Analysis
A.
Failure to Consider Convention Ground
[12]
The Applicant submits that the Board erred in failing to consider whether he would be targeted as a member of the particular social group of failed refugee claimants. During the hearing, counsel made submissions and presented two articles in support of this position.
[13]
The Respondent maintains that this did not amount to an error as the Applicant's Personal Information Form (PIF) stated he feared persecution by "security forces and henchmen", not as a failed refugee claimant. This latter argument was not central to his claim. Moreover, the preponderance of evidence submitted was in relation to the situation facing Tamils in Sri Lanka. At least of one of the articles on the issue of risks for returning failed asylum seekers described a situation that could be distinguished from that facing the Applicant.
[14]
Reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, I recognize that this Court has overturned immigration decisions for a failure to consider an additional ground of persecution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ no 650 at para 106, for example, Justice Judith Snider suggested that while it was open to a visa officer to consider an additional ground of persecution and reject it; the failure to provide an explanation for not assessing that risk amounted to a reviewable error.
[15]
The Court has nonetheless stressed that the Board is only required to consider an additional ground of persecution where there is evidence on the record to support it (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ no 305 at paras 9-11;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ no 1253 at para 19).
[16]
More specifically, Justice Snider accepted in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] FCJ no 1364 at para 8 that while ignoring part of a refugee claim would ordinarily be a serious error, this was not the case where membership in the particular social group was not central to the claim and appeared "to be an afterthought that was not supported by any evidence."
[17]
In light of these determinations, I am prepared to accept the Respondent's position that the failure to expressly consider the Applicant's additional ground of persecution as a failed refugee claimant is not an error warranting the Court's intervention.
[18]
Similar to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the issue represents an afterthought as opposed to the central basis of his claim. Indeed, the Applicant's allegations focused on treatment he experienced as a Tamil in Sri Lanka. The evidentiary record and the Applicant's testimony reflect this preoccupation. The Board ultimately concluded that there was less than a serious chance of persecution on "any Convention ground."
[19]
While Applicant's counsel provided two articles as evidence of the risk to failed asylum seekers, these were limited in comparison with the material devoted to the central aspect of his claim and insufficient to establish a clear obligation for the Board to address the issue. As the Respondent stresses, "the legal duty or onus remains on a claimant to make out his or her claim in clear and unmistakeable terms" (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In addition, Justice Russel Zinn in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, noted that the Board is not under an obligation to "undertake a microscopic examination of the record before it to try to uncover a risk."
B.
Legal Test for Assessing Persecution
[20]
The Applicant takes issue with the Board's characterization of the test for assessing persecution at paragraph 52 of its reasons that "the situation, while not perfect, is not such that the claimant will be persecuted due to any Convention ground or harmed pursuant to section 97 of the Act."
[21]
According to the Applicant, the test lies somewhere between the balance of probabilities (or more likely than not) and more than a mere possibility of persecution (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA)). Elaborating on this distinction, the Supreme Court of Canada stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[120] Both the existence of the subjective fear and the fact that the fear is objectively well-founded must be established on a balance of probabilities. In the specific context of refugee determination, it has been established by the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that the claimant need not prove that persecution would be more likely than not in order to meet the objective portion of the test. The claimant must establish, however, that there is more than a "mere possibility" of persecution. The applicable test has been expressed as a "reasonable possibility" or, more appropriately in my view, as a "serious possibility".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Respondent acknowledges that the Board misstated the test in paragraph 52 but contends that the test was applied correctly elsewhere in the decision and the Applicant failed to satisfy it.
[23]
I agree with the Respondent's assessment. While the Board implied a higher threshold than that articulated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, it is not fatal as it is evident from the remainder of the decision that the Board appreciated the correct test to be applied. At paragraph 10 of its reasons, the Board did "not believe his fear to be well-founded or that he faces a serious possibility of risk if he were to return to his country of origin." Similarly, the Board states at paragraph 20 that "[b] ased on a thorough review of often less than consistent information, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the situation for Tamils in the country has improved significantly over the past two years and there is less than a serious chance of persecution and it is less than likely that the claimant will be harmed pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA."
[24]
Admittedly, the Board could have been clearer in its choice of wording. The statements referred to do not suggest, however, that an inappropriately high threshold was ultimately applied. The Board simply concluded that the Applicant had not established subjective or objective fear of persecution in accordance with the relevant tests.
C.
Cumulative Persecution
[25]
The Applicant also raises a concern that the Board failed to consider whether the incidents of detention cumulatively amounted to persecution. Specifically, he argues that the Board failed to come to grips with whether there is more than a mere possibility that he would be detained, as he was several times in the past, because he is a young Tamil male from the North or the risk of discriminatory measures. The Applicant points to evidence of continued security detentions being applied in a discriminatory fashion as well as the Board's acknowledgment of beatings and torture in the course of interrogation.
[26]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ no 395 at para 42, the Federal Court of Appeal emphasized:
[42] [...] the Board is duty bound to consider all of the events which may have an impact on a claimant's claim that he or she has a well founded fear of persecution, including those events, which, if taken individually, do not amount to persecution, but if taken together, may justify a claim to a well founded fear of persecution. [...]
[27]
The Board is required to consider the cumulative nature of the incidents and whether they amount to persecution. In my view, the Board met that requirement in the present case.
[28]
From the outset, it was noted that the Applicant's claim was based on harassment by the LTTE and later security forces. It involved "several detentions during which he was interrogated and beaten, but was at all times released." The Board later noted that "[t] he fact he was released in all cases, albeit with the occasional bribes, leads the Panel, to believe" that his fear was not well-founded. This demonstrates that the Board considered the evidence as to the significance of the detentions as a whole. Indeed, the claim was itself based on the combined effect of the detentions as no single incident was determinative.
[29]
I also recognize the finding in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] FCJ no 412 at para 25:
[...] Proof of past persecution for one of the listed reasons may support a finding of fact that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in the future, but it will not necessarily do so. If, for example, there is evidence that country conditions have changed since the persecution occurred, that evidence must be evaluated to determine whether the fear remains well founded.
[30]
While the Applicant refers to incidents of past detentions, based on the determination in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, these are not necessarily determinative of the persecution analysis. The Board reasonably considered the Applicant's experiences and inconsistent evidence of changed country circumstances before concluding that he had "a less than serious chance of persecution" based on ethnicity.
[31]
The Applicant has not demonstrated a clear error by the Board in considering the cumulative effect of the incidents of detention as amounting to persecution.
D.
Threat of Paramilitaries
[32]
The Applicant faults the Board for failing to address the paramilitaries' threat that they would tell Sri Lankan authorities he was a LTTE member.
[33]
I note, however, that the Board directed its attention to the threat of extortion by paramilitary groups in the section devoted to generalized risk. While there was a risk to the Applicant as an individual returning from abroad and perceived to be wealthy, it was prevalent within this subgroup.
[34]
This conclusion was reasonable. The Applicant has not pointed to any specific evidence before the Board of additional threats posed by paramilitary groups so as to undermine the characterization of this issue as one of a generalized risk of extortion.
E.
Credibility Findings
[35]
The Applicant takes issue with the Board's finding that he was not the subject of a warrant because he was eventually released after each detention and was able to leave Sri Lanka via the airport. He notes that the Applicant did not say that he was the subject of a warrant.
[36]
I must agree with the Respondent that this does not lead to the conclusion that the Board's credibility findings were unreasonable. The Board simply inferred that since the Applicant had been released in the past and was not arrested on leaving Sri Lanka at the airport that he would not have been on a high security watch list. It never implied that the Applicant stated there was a warrant for his arrest. In assessing the Applicant's fear and risk there is nothing unreasonable about making a deduction regarding an arrest warrant in this manner. It was within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes.
[37]
The Board has discretion to weigh the evidence and make findings regarding an Applicant's credibility. As long as this is done in "clear and unmistakable terms" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), as was the case here, or without regard for the evidence, it is difficult to identify a basis for the Court's intervention.
F.
Change of Circumstances
[38]
The Applicant disputes the Board's change of circumstances findings for references to returning refugees when others remain in or are heading to India as well as tourism to the North by Southern Sri Lankans that he considers irrelevant to his claim.
[39]
I agree with the Respondent, however, that he has not demonstrated the Board's conclusions were unreasonable. Based on the evidence, the Board was justified in suggesting that signs of changed circumstances include the return of former refugees to Sri Lanka and tourists entering the North, irrespective of whether they are Sri Lankans from the South or foreigners. This is consistent with the Board's role in balancing and highlighting relevant evidence.
[40]
In addition, the Applicant notes the Board does not acknowledge evidence that some newly hired Tamil police officers are from the paramilitaries or the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) had its access to the North withdrawn in 2009.
[41]
As the Respondent makes clear, this does not demonstrate the Board ignored the evidence. Unless the contrary is shown, the Board is "presumed to have weighed and considered all of the evidence presented to it" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). There is no requirement to specifically mention every piece of evidence (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[42]
Moreover, the Applicant's primary issue with the Board's assessment as to the change of circumstances is the weight accorded to this evidence. The Board acknowledged the continued discrimination of Tamils and beatings during interrogation. It nonetheless found "[b] ased on a thorough review of often less than consistent information" that the situation for Tamils had improved in the last two years. This balanced assessment demonstrates justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process.
G.
Misstatements
[43]
Finally, the Applicant asserts that the Board erred by making two misstatements in the course of its reasons, while the Respondent insists these were not material to his claim.
[44]
The Board referred to the EPDP (Eelam People's Democratic Party) as a splinter group from the LTTE, but it is a separate political party. This distinction did not in any way prejudice the Applicant, since he did not base his claim on any particular issue involving the EPDP. This misstatement was made in the course of reviewing general country conditions rather than analyzing specific elements of the Applicant's allegations.
[45]
Similarly, the discussion of a "high security watch list" as opposed to the wording in documentary evidence of an "alert list" does not affect the Board's overall assessment. As the Respondent points out, the central finding on this issue was that he was released from detention on each occasion and had no problems traveling through an international airport. This led to the conclusion that his fear of persecution was not well-founded. The exact characterization of the list is immaterial.
[46]
The misstatements raised by the Applicant are minor in the broader context of his claim and do not amount to a reviewable error.
VI.
Conclusion
[47]
Despite all of the issues raised by the Applicant, he has not demonstrated a basis for the Court's intervention. For this reason, his application is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[48]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
this application for judicial review is dismissed.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur, Varnan Paramanathan, sollicite le contrôle judiciaire de la décision, en date du 29 juillet 2011, par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la Commission) a conclu qu'il n'était ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention ni une personne à protéger selon les articles 96 et 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la LIPR).
I.
Exposé des faits
[2]
Le demandeur est un Tamoul originaire de Jaffna, dans le Nord du Sri Lanka. Il a toutefois vécu dans le secteur de Kotahena, à Colombo, pendant deux ans et deux mois avant de quitter son pays.
[3]
Il a allégué que sa famille a fait l'objet de harcèlement de la part des Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (les TLET) et, par la suite, des forces de sécurité. Il a expliqué qu'il a été détenu à plusieurs reprises pendant de brèves périodes au cours desquelles il a été interrogé et battu avant d'être relâché. Ainsi, il a été détenu dans les situations suivantes:
• Août 2007 - Après une embuscade tendue par les TLET au camp militaire local, à Uduvil, il a été détenu avec d'autres Tamouls pendant cinq jours au cours desquels il a été battu et blessé, avant que son père ne négocie sa libération.
• Juillet 2008 - Il a été détenu par l'armée au poste de contrôle d'Omanthai, où il se trouvait pour aider son oncle, mais il a été libéré au bout de trois heures.
• Août 2008 - Lorsqu'il habitait avec sa tante à Colombo, il a été détenu et interrogé pendant trois jours par les agents de la division des enquêtes criminelles (la CID) avant qu'un policier à la retraite n'intervienne en sa faveur pour qu'il soit libéré.
• Avril 2009 - Lors d'une ronde de police, il a été détenu dans le secteur de Kotahena, à Colombo, avec d'autres Tamouls juste avant la fin de la guerre, mais son patron a réussi à le faire libérer après deux jours.
• Juillet 2010 - Il a été arrêté par l'armée, le CID et des paramilitaires de Karuna à la résidence de sa tante située dans le secteur de Kotahena, à Colombo, et détenu pendant trois jours au camp militaire de Petteh, soit jusqu'à ce qu'un homme d'affaires engagé par sa tante verse un pot-de-vin à la police en échange de sa libération.
[4]
Le demandeur affirme qu'un agent l'a aidé à s'enfuir du Sri Lanka le 9 septembre 2010.
II.
Décision contestée
[5]
La Commission n'a pas cru que le demandeur craignait avec raison d'être persécuté ou qu'il existait une possibilité sérieuse qu'il soit exposé à un risque advenant son retour au Sri Lanka. Il a été toujours été libéré, même si des pots-de-vin ont parfois dû être versés. La Commission a cru, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'aucun mandat d'arrestation n'avait été décerné à son endroit et que son nom ne figurait pas sur la liste de surveillance à haute sécurité du gouvernement.
[6]
La Commission a procédé à l'analyse du changement de circonstances au Sri Lanka. Après avoir examiné des renseignements souvent incohérents, la Commission a conclu que la situation des Tamouls au pays s'était considérablement améliorée au cours des deux dernières années. On a vu le gouvernement tendre la main à la communauté tamoule en engageant plus de Tamouls dans les forces policières et militaires. Toutefois, la Commission a reconnu que les minorités ethniques, particulièrement les Tamouls, continuaient d'être couramment victimes de discrimination. Considérant la preuve dans son ensemble, la Commission a tranché que « la situation, bien que non idéale, n'est pas à ce point dangereuse que le demandeur d'asile risque d'être persécuté pour un motif prévu à la Convention ou de subir un préjudice suivant l'article 97 de la
Loi
».
[7]
Finalement, il a été question du risque que le demandeur soit victime d'extorsion de la part de membres indésirables des forces de sécurité et des paramilitaires de Karuna. Le demandeur s'est dit préoccupé par le fait qu'il serait considéré, parce qu'il revenait d'un pays occidental, comme une riche cible potentielle. La Commission a néanmoins conclu que le risque auquel serait exposé le demandeur constituerait un risque courant et généralisé qui touche son sous-groupe et qui n'est pas visé par l'alinéa 97(1)
b
).
III.
Questions à trancher
[8]
Le demandeur soulève plusieurs questions qui peuvent être formulées comme suit:
a) La Commission a-t-elle fait erreur en ne tenant pas compte d'un autre motif prévu à la Convention?
b) La Commission a-t-elle fait erreur dans l'application du critère juridique d'appréciation de la crainte de persécution du demandeur?
c) La Commission a-t-elle fait erreur en ne tenant pas compte de l'effet cumulatif des détentions du demandeur?
d) La Commission a-t-elle omis de tenir compte de la menace que constituent les groupes paramilitaires pour le demandeur?
e) La Commission a-t-elle fait erreur dans les conclusions qu'elle a tirées concernant la crédibilité?
f) La Commission a-t-elle fait erreur dans son appréciation du changement de circonstances au Sri Lanka?
g) La Commission a-t-elle fait erreur en rapportant incorrectement les faits?
IV.
Norme de contrôle
[9]
La majorité de ces questions sont des questions de fait ou des questions mixtes de fait et de droit qui commandent l'application de la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 51).
[10]
Dans l'application de cette norme, la Cour doit s'intéresser « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47).
[11]
L'application d'un critère juridique est toutefois une question de droit qui doit faire l'objet d'un contrôle suivant la norme de la décision correcte (voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité au paragraphe 50;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 44).
V.
Analyse
A.
Défaut de tenir compte d'un motif prévu à la Convention
[12]
Le demandeur avance que la Commission a fait erreur en n'examinant pas la question de savoir s'il serait ciblé en tant que membre du groupe social particulier des demandeurs d'asile déboutés. Au cours de l'audience, l'avocat a présenté des observations et deux articles pour étayer cette position.
[13]
Le défendeur soutient que cette omission ne constitue pas une erreur étant donné que le demandeur a affirmé dans son formulaire de renseignements personnels (le FRP) qu'il craignait d'être persécuté par [traduction] « les forces de sécurité et les hommes de main », et non en tant que demandeur d'asile débouté. Ce dernier argument n'était pas un élément central de sa demande. Qui plus est, la preuve prépondérante présentée se rapportait à la situation à laquelle les Tamouls doivent faire face au Sri Lanka. Au moins un des articles portant sur la question des risques liés au retour des demandeurs d'asile déboutés décrivait une situation qui pouvait être différenciée de celle que le demandeur doit affronter.
[14]
Après avoir examiné la jurisprudence pertinente, je reconnais que notre Cour a annulé des décisions en matière d'immigration parce qu'un autre motif de persécution n'avait pas été examiné.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 650, au paragraphe 106, par exemple, la juge Judith Snider a affirmé que, même s'il est loisible à un agent des visas d'examiner un autre motif de persécution et de le rejeter, le défaut d'expliquer pourquoi ce risque n'a pas été évalué constitue une erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[15]
La Cour a néanmoins souligné que la Commission est seulement tenue d'examiner un autre motif de persécution lorsque la preuve au dossier permet de l'étayer (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 305, aux paragraphes 9 à 11;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 1253, au paragraphe 19).
[16]
Plus particulièrement, la juge Snider a reconnu dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] ACF no 1364, au paragraphe 8, que, même si le fait d'écarter une partie d'une demande d'asile constitue normalement une erreur grave, ce n'est pas le cas lorsque l'appartenance à un groupe social n'est pas un élément central de la demande et semble« avoir été le résultat d'une réflexion après coup, aucunement appuyée par la preuve ».
[17]
À la lumière de ces décisions, je suis disposé à accepter la position du défendeur selon laquelle le défaut d'examiner précisément un autre motif de persécution, en l'occurrence le fait que le demandeur est un demandeur d'asile débouté, ne constitue pas une erreur justifiant l'intervention de la Cour.
[18]
De la même manière que dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, cette question est en fait le résultat d'une réflexion après coup plutôt que le fondement central de la demande d'asile. D'ailleurs, les allégations du demandeur portent principalement sur les mauvais traitements dont il a été victime au Sri Lanka en tant que Tamoul. Le dossier de preuve et le témoignage du demandeur reflètent cette préoccupation. La Commission a en fin de compte conclu qu'il n'existe pas vraiment de risque sérieux qu'il soit persécuté pour « un motif prévu à la Convention ».
[19]
Même si l'avocat du demandeur a versé en preuve deux articles portant sur les risques auxquels sont exposés les demandeurs d'asile déboutés, leur importance était limitée par rapport à la documentation intéressant l'élément central de sa demande, et ces articles n'étaient pas suffisants pour établir que la Commission avait clairement l'obligation de trancher la question. Comme le souligne le défendeur, « le demandeur conserve l'obligation juridique ou le fardeau d'établir le bien-fondé de ses allégations de façon claire et non équivoque »(voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 11). De plus, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, le juge Russel Zinn a souligné que la Commission n'est pas dans l'obligation de « se livrer à un examen microscopique du dossier dont elle est saisie afin de déceler tout risque éventuel ».
B.
Critère juridique d'évaluation du risque de persécution
[20]
Le demandeur n'est pas d'accord avec la Commission sur la description qu'elle donne du critère d'évaluation du risque de persécution au paragraphe 52 de ses motifs, description suivant laquelle « la situation, bien que non idéale, n'est pas à ce point dangereuse que le demandeur d'asile risque d'être persécuté pour un motif prévu à la Convention ou de subir un préjudice suivant l'article 97 de la
Loi
».
[21]
Selon le demandeur, le critère applicable se situe entre la prépondérance des probabilités (ou le fait que la persécution soit plus probable que le contraire) et l'existence de plus qu'une simple possibilité de persécution (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF)). Traitant de cette distinction, la Cour suprême du Canada a affirmé ce qui suit dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[120] Tant l'existence d'une crainte subjective que le fondement objectif de cette crainte doivent être établis selon la prépondérance des probabilités. Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour d'appel fédérale a statué que, dans le contexte spécifique de la détermination du statut de réfugié, le demandeur n'est pas tenu d'établir, pour satisfaire à l'élément objectif du critère, qu'il est plus probable qu'il sera persécuté que le contraire. Il doit cependant établir qu'il existe plus qu'une« simple possibilité » qu'il soit persécuté. On a décrit le critère applicable comme étant l'existence d'une « possibilité raisonnable »ou, plus justement à mon avis, d'une « possibilité sérieuse ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  défendeur reconnaît que la Commission a énoncé de façon inexacte le critère au paragraphe 52, mais il soutient que le critère a été appliqué correctement ailleurs dans la décision et que le demandeur n'y a pas satisfait.
[23]
Je souscris à l'analyse du défendeur. Même si la Commission a proposé un critère préliminaire plus rigoureux que celui énoncé dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, cette erreur n'est pas fatale puisqu'il ressort clairement du reste de la décision qu'elle a tenu compte du bon critère. Au paragraphe 10 de ses motifs, la Commission affirme qu'elle « ne croit pas que la crainte du demandeur d'asile soit fondée ou qu'il serait sérieusement possible que celui-ci soit exposé à un risque s'il retournait dans son pays d'origine ». De la même manière, elle affirme au paragraphe 20 que, « [s]e fondant sur un examen rigoureux de renseignements souvent incohérents, le tribunal estime que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, la situation des Tamouls dans le pays s'est considérablement améliorée au cours des deux dernières années et que le demandeur d'asile ne risque pas sérieusement d'être persécuté [...]. Le tribunal considère aussi peu probable que le demandeur d'asile serait exposé à une des menaces énoncées à l'article 97 de la LIPR ».
[24]
Il faut reconnaître que la Commission aurait pu être plus claire en choisissant mieux ses mots. Les déclarations en question ne laissent toutefois pas croire qu'un critère préliminaire déraisonnablement rigoureux a été appliqué en fin de compte. La Commission a simplement conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas établi l'existence d'une crainte subjective ou objective de persécution selon les critères pertinents.
C.
Persécution cumulative
[25]
Le demandeur se dit également préoccupé par le fait que la Commission n'a pas examiné la question de savoir si les incidents où il a été détenu constituaient cumulativement de la persécution. Plus particulièrement, il avance que la Commission n'a pas abordé la question de savoir s'il existait plus qu'une simple possibilité qu'il soit détenu, comme il l'a été plusieurs fois par le passé, parce qu'il est un jeune Tamoul du Nord, ni le risque qu'il fasse l'objet de mesures discriminatoires. Le demandeur attire l'attention sur la preuve concernant le maintien en détention pour des raisons de sécurité qui est appliqué de façon discriminatoire, ainsi que sur le fait que la Commission a reconnu le recours à la violence et à la torture durant les interrogatoires.
[26]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 395, au paragraphe 42, la Cour d'appel fédérale a souligné ce qui suit:
[42] [...] la Commission a l'obligation de tenir compte de tous les faits qui peuvent avoir une incidence sur l'affirmation du demandeur d'asile suivant laquelle il craint avec raison d'être persécuté, y compris des incidents qui, pris isolément, ne constitueraient pas de la persécution mais qui, pris globalement, pourraient justifier une allégation de crainte fondée de persécution. [...]
[27]
La Commission se doit de tenir compte de la nature cumulative des incidents et de se demander s'ils constituent de la persécution. À mon avis, la Commission a satisfait à cette exigence en l'espèce.
[28]
Dès le départ, il a été souligné que la demande d'asile du demandeur se fondait sur le harcèlement exercé par les TLET puis par les forces de sécurité. Ce harcèlement se traduisait par le fait qu'il « avait été détenu à plusieurs reprises pendant de brèves périodes, qu'il avait alors été interrogé et battu, mais que, chaque fois, il avait été libéré ». La Commission a plus loin fait remarquer que « [l] e fait qu'il ait été libéré dans tous les cas, bien que, à l'occasion, en raison du versement de pots-de-vin, amène le tribunal à croire » que sa crainte n'était pas bien fondée. Ces affirmations démontrent que la Commission a examiné la preuve en tenant compte de l'importance de l'ensemble des détentions. En fait, la demande était elle-même fondée sur l'effet combiné des détentions car aucun incident pris isolément n'était déterminant.
[29]
Je tiens compte également de la conclusion tirée dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] ACF no 412, au paragraphe 25:
[...] La preuve des persécutions dont le demandeur a déjà été victime peut justifier la conclusion de fait qu'il a raison de craindre d'être persécuté à l'avenir, mais cette conclusion ne sera pas nécessairement tirée. Si, par exemple, la preuve démontre que la situation a changé au pays d'origine depuis que les persécutions ont eu lieu, il faut évaluer ces éléments de preuve pour déterminer si la crainte demeure justifiée.
[30]
Le demandeur fait état de plusieurs détentions, mais compte tenu de la conclusion dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, ces incidents ne sont pas nécessairement déterminants dans l'analyse relative à la persécution. La Commission a tenu compte de façon raisonnable de ce qu'avait vécu le demandeur et de la preuve contradictoire relative au changement de circonstances dans le pays avant de conclure que le demandeur d'asile« ne risque pas sérieusement d'être persécuté » du fait de son origine ethnique.
[31]
Le demandeur n'a pas démontré que la Commission a clairement commis une erreur dans son analyse de l'effet cumulatif des incidents de détention pour déterminer s'ils constituaient de la persécution.
D.
Menace que constituent les groupes paramilitaires
[32]
Le demandeur reproche à la Commission de ne pas avoir tenu compte du fait que les paramilitaires le menaçaient de dire aux autorités sri-lankaises qu'il faisait partie des TLET.
[33]
Je constate cependant que la Commission s'est intéressée à la menace d'extorsion de la part de groupes paramilitaires dans la section portant sur le risque généralisé. Il existe un risque pour le demandeur en tant que personne revenant de l'étranger et considérée comme fortunée, mais il s'agit d'un risque courant qui touche son sous-groupe.
[34]
Cette conclusion était raisonnable. Le demandeur n'a pas fait ressortir un élément de preuve en particulier devant la Commission en ce qui a trait aux autres menaces que représentaient les groupes paramilitaires afin de contester la qualification de cette menace de risque généralisé d'extorsion.
E.
Conclusions touchant la crédibilité
[35]
Le demandeur conteste la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle il n'avait pas fait l'objet d'un mandat d'arrestation parce qu'il était toujours libéré chaque fois qu'il était mis en détention et parce qu'il avait réussi à quitter le Sri Lanka à partir de l'aéroport. Il fait observer qu'il n'a pas dit qu'il avait fait l'objet d'un mandat d'arrestation.
[36]
Il me faut convenir avec le défendeur que cela ne permet pas d'en déduire que les conclusions de la Commission concernant la crédibilité étaient déraisonnables. La Commission a simplement inféré que, puisque le demandeur avait été libéré par le passé et qu'il n'avait été arrêté à l'aéroport lorsqu'il a quitté le Sri Lanka, son nom n'était pas inscrit sur une liste de surveillance à haute sécurité. Elle n'a pas laissé entendre que le demandeur avait affirmé qu'un mandat d'arrestation avait été lancé contre lui. Dans l'appréciation de la crainte du demandeur et du risque, il n'y a rien de déraisonnable dans le fait de faire des déductions concernant un mandat d'arrestation de cette manière. Cela faisait partie des issues possibles acceptables.
[37]
La Commission est investie du pouvoir discrétionnaire d'apprécier la preuve et de tirer des conclusions concernant la crédibilité du demandeur. Dans la mesure où elle tire ses conclusions « en termes clairs et explicites » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), comme en l'espèce, ou en ne tenant pas compte de la preuve, il est difficile de justifier l'intervention de la Cour.
F.
Changement de circonstances
[38]
Le demandeur conteste les conclusions de la Commission sur le changement de circonstances. La Commission a mentionné que des réfugiés retournent au pays et que d'autres décident d'y rester ou de se rendre en Inde, ainsi que le fait que des Sri-Lankais du Sud font du tourisme dans le Nord. Selon lui, ces conclusions sont dépourvues de pertinence dans le cadre de sa demande d'asile.
[39]
Toutefois, tout comme le défendeur, je suis d'avis que le demandeur n'a pas démontré que les conclusions de la Commission étaient déraisonnables. Compte tenu de la preuve, la Commission était justifiée de laisser entendre que le retour d'anciens réfugiés au Sri Lanka et la présence de touristes dans le Nord du pays, qu'ils soient Sri-Lankais du Sud ou étrangers, étaient des signes de changement de circonstances. Cette façon de faire est compatible avec les attributions de la Commission consistant à soupeser et faire ressortir la preuve pertinente.
[40]
De plus, le demandeur souligne que la Commission n'a pas tenu compte de la preuve que des policiers tamouls nouvellement engagés proviennent des groupes paramilitaires ou que le Comité international de la Croix-Rouge (le CICR) s'était vu refuser l'accès dans le Nord du pays en 2009.
[41]
Comme le défendeur l'a clairement indiqué, cela ne démontre pas que la Commission n'a pas tenu compte de la preuve. Jusqu'à preuve contraire, la Commission est « présumé[e] avoir pesé et considéré toute la preuve dont [elle] est saisi[e] » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Aussi, la Commission n'est pas tenue de mentionner expressément chaque élément de preuve (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[42]
De plus, la principale chose que le demandeur conteste relativement au changement de circonstances dont fait état la Commission est le poids accordé à ces éléments de preuve. La Commission a reconnu que les Tamouls continuaient de faire l'objet de discrimination et qu'ils étaient battus durant les interrogatoires. Elle a néanmoins conclu, en« [s] e fondant sur un examen rigoureux de renseignements souvent incohérents » que la situation des Tamouls s'était améliorée au cours des deux dernières années. Pareille évaluation équilibrée démontre la justification et la transparence de la décision, et l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel.
G.
Faits incorrectement rapportés
[43]
Enfin, le demandeur affirme que la Commission a fait erreur en rapportant les faits incorrectement à deux reprises dans ses motifs. Le défendeur insiste toutefois pour dire que ces faits incorrectement rapportés sont dépourvus de pertinence quant à la demande d'asile.
[44]
La Commission a mentionné que l'EPDP (Parti démocratique populaire de l'Eelam) était un groupe dissident des TLET, mais il s'agit en fait d'un parti politique distinct. Cette distinction n'a d'aucune manière causé préjudice au demandeur, puisqu'il n'a fondé sa demande d'asile sur aucune question particulière touchant l'EPDP. Cette déclaration erronée a été faite au cours de l'examen de la situation générale qui règne dans le pays, et non dans le cadre de l'analyse des éléments particuliers des allégations du demandeur.
[45]
De la même manière, la discussion concernant la « liste de surveillance à haute sécurité »,par opposition à une [traduction] « liste d'alerte », selon la formulation employée dans la preuve documentaire, n'a aucune incidence sur l'évaluation générale faite par la Commission. Comme le défendeur le souligne, la conclusion principale sur cette question était que le demandeur avait été libéré chaque fois qu'il avait été mis en détention et qu'il avait franchi les douanes à un aéroport international sans être arrêté, ce qui a amené la Commission à conclure que le demandeur ne craignait pas avec raison d'être persécuté. La qualification exacte de la liste est dépourvue de pertinence.
[46]
Les faits incorrectement rapportés qui ont été relevés par le demandeur sont mineurs dans le contexte général de sa demande d'asile et ne constituent pas une erreur susceptible de contrôle.
VI.
Conclusion
[47]
En dépit de toutes les questions qu'il a soulevées, le demandeur n'a pas démontré l'existence d'un fondement de nature à justifier l'intervention de la Cour. Par conséquent, sa demande est rejetée.

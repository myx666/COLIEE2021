Gagné, J.
: The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration [Minister] seeks judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [the Board], dated February 5, 2013, whereby it determined that the respondent, a Sri Lankan Tamil refugee who arrived in Canada aboard the
Ocean Lady,
was not excluded from refugee protection under section 98 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [Act]. The Board allowed the applicant's
sur place
refugee claim and so found that he qualified as a
Convention
refugee within the meaning of its section 96.
[2]
In recent months, this Court has rendered several decisions involving refugee claims made by Sri Lankan Tamil passengers aboard the
Ocean Lady and Sun Sea
ships that landed on our shores in late 2009 and mid-2010 (see Justice Gleason's decision in
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for an overview of recent jurisprudence (as of November 2013) on the matter).
[3]
While the Minister had originally sought to also challenge the Board's inclusion determination, he has since desisted from that argument. The Minister now exclusively seeks to challenge the Board's exclusion determination, arguing that there are serious reasons to believe that the respondent is complicit in a crime against humanity pursuant to Article 1F(
a
) of the
Convention
, as he has links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE]. As a matter of reference, Article 1F(
a
) of the
Convention
is incorporated into the Act - the Board's enabling statute - by its section 98. Since the Board's decision, the Supreme Court of Canada has refined the test for complicity, barring its application to instances of "mere association" or "passive acquiescence" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[4]
For the reasons discussed below, this application for judicial review will be dismissed.
Background
[5]
The respondent's refugee claim was based on his alleged fear of persecution and risk of torture at the hands of the Sri Lankan authorities due to his possible involvement and association with the LTTE.
[6]
The respondent and his family allegedly had been arrested and interrogated on various occasions by Sri Lankan authorities regarding their possible involvement and knowledge of the LTTE. In April 2008, the respondent moved to Colombo hoping to eventually travel to Saudi Arabia to find a job as a carpenter. While in Colombo, he claimed to have lent his cell phone to a man with whom he shared a room and about whom he knew very little. This man allegedly used his cell phone during the period from April to September 2008. According to his landlady at the time, in early September 2008, the police came looking for the respondent in Colombo while he was away. He managed to avoid the police, and moved to another house briefly before leaving for Singapore on September 11, 2008.
[7]
The respondent remained in Singapore for 11 days before leaving for Malaysia. He then remained in Malaysia until August 2009.
[8]
While in Malaysia, the respondent learned from his mother that his photograph had appeared in a newspaper along with ten others for suspicion of importing electronic communications equipment for the LTTE. It was alleged that his twin brother was, as a result of his photograph being published, arrested, tortured and questioned about his whereabouts.
[9]
In January 2009, the respondent applied for refugee status with the United Nations' office in Malaysia, and was accepted in July 2009. Without permanent resident status or permission to work, the respondent made arrangements to travel to Canada aboard the ship
Ocean Lady
. He boarded it on September 5, 2009 and arrived in Canada in October 2009.
[10]
At the hearing of the respondent's refugee claim, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness [MPSEP] intervened and made submissions relating to the exclusion of the respondent under Article 1F(
a
) of the
Convention
. He maintained that the respondent was complicit in war crimes or crimes against humanity because of his association with the LTTE, an organization which the Canadian government has identified as being involved in terrorism. The MPSEP based his submissions on the following evidence:
1. A warrant of arrest, dated May 19, 2009, against the respondent for "aiding and abetting the LTTE organization";
2. An Interpol red notice indicated that the respondent is wanted for "aiding and abetting the LTTE organization";
3. A photograph of the respondent with the listing of "terrorism" under the heading "offenses";
4. A copy of Sri Lankan state regulations describing a ban on the import of certain goods, specifically explosive detection equipment, with these items circled in text;
5. A transcribed statement made by one Anthony Pullay Tony Gerai [Gerai], following his arrival in Colombo with banned equipment, namely high tech telecommunication equipment. It is this statement that led the Sri Lankan police to seek the arrest of the respondent;
6. A Sri Lankan Criminal Investigation Department Final Report;
7. The respondent's identification of his own cell phone number which was identical to that of a certain "Karthik," Gerai's contact;
8. Alleged similarities between the respondent's name and Karthik, which the applicant contends are one and the same individual, and;
9. The overall credibility of the respondent's account with respect to the use of his cell phone by his roommate, to his description of his roommate, and more generally, to the overall account of his stay in Colombo.
[11]
The applicant conceded at the hearing before the Board that if the respondent was not excluded from refugee protection, then the evidence was sufficient to establish risk upon return to Sri Lanka.
[12]
One of the articles included in the Minister's disclosure before the Board specifically referred to the fact that Sri Lankan authorities were aware that the respondent was in Canada, had travelled aboard the
Ocean Lady
, and had made a refugee claim in Canada. It further noted that he was "being hunted down" by the Sri Lankan authorities. Documentary evidence also made clear that those perceived by Sri Lankan authorities to have links with the LTTE are at risk of persecution in Sri Lanka.
The Impugned Decision
[13]
The Board determined that the Minister had not met its burden of proof within the meaning of Article 1F(
a
) of the
Convention
, and found that the claimant was not excluded from refugee protection. The Minister had to prove that "there [were] serious reasons for considering" that the claimant had committed a crime described at Article 1F(
a
) of the
Convention
. However, there was insufficient trustworthy evidence to conclude that the claimant himself has been involved with the LTTE.
[14]
Notably, the Board found that there were substantial differences between the name "Karthik" and the claimant's name such that the Minister's conclusion that Karthik and the respondent were one and the same person was not supported by the evidence. There was also no evidence to indicate that Karthik was either a code name or an alias for the claimant.
[15]
Meanwhile, the charges against the claimant had been laid pursuant to the Emergency Regulations, which were repealed in August 2011. As such, the offense alleged is null and void.
[16]
Moreover, the Board assigned little weight to Gerai's statutory declaration since there was no signature or date, and there were numerous discrepancies in dates and spelling found therein (for example, there were three different spellings of the name of the officer who allegedly prepared the notes), and this, "especially in light of available evidence that Sri Lankan forces are known to use torture during interrogation."
[17]
The Board did have certain concerns with the claimant's credibility, especially with respect to his contention that he did not communicate with his roommate, considering they shared a one room dwelling for months. Nonetheless, the Board further concluded, notably based on the Minister's concessions, that if the claimant was not excluded from refugee protection, then the evidence was sufficient to establish risk upon return to Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the claimant was deemed to be a refugee
sur place
as described by the
UNHCR Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status
on the basis of having travelled to Canada aboard the ship
Ocean Lady
and the associated media coverage.
Issues and Standard of Review
[18]
As discussed, the applicant has abandoned his argument with respect to inclusion. Accordingly, this application raises the following issues:
1. Did the Board reasonably conclude that the Minister had not met the requisite onus regarding exclusion with credible and trustworthy evidence?
2. Did the Board provide adequate reasons?
3. Are there special reasons for the Court to order costs against the applicant?
[19]
The issue of the adequacy of reasons can be subsumed under question 1.
[20]
The parties agree that the applicable standard of review for issue 1 is reasonableness. The Court has held that findings of complicity in crimes against humanity is a question of mixed law and fact and so is owed "substantial deference" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at para 47,
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
Analysis
Did the Board reasonably conclude that the Minister had not met the requisite onus regarding exclusion with credible and trustworthy evidence?
[21]
The applicant argues that the Board was presented with sufficient evidence linking the respondent with the LTTE for exclusion under Article 1F(
a
) of the
Convention
, even if one were to apply the new test laid out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . There, the Court reframed the test for complicity such that mere association or passive acquiescence is no longer sufficient to warrant exclusion ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 29).
[22]
The MPSEP had submitted several key pieces of evidence to support an exclusion finding. Of particular note, the applicant argues that the respondent was personally named and identified in an Interpol Red Notice as well as a Sri Lankan arrest warrant, both of which indicated that he was sought for "aiding and abetting the LTTE organization." This Court has acknowledged that, in some cases, proof of a valid warrant issued by a foreign country may be persuasive that the threshold for "serious reasons for considering" has been met. In those cases, where evidence of a warrant is the sole evidence relied upon, the Board must go further and determine whether the claimant is credible. Considering the issues the Board had with the respondent's credibility, the applicant is thus of the view that it erred when not determining the applicant excluded (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
The applicant further states that the Board failed to provide reasons for dismissing the Interpol Red Notice.
[24]
Finally, the applicant maintains that Gerai's reference to his contact "Karthik" was in fact to the respondent, based on the fact that the respondent recognizes Karthik's cell phone number as his own.
[25]
As for the respondent, he submits that the Board carefully assessed the Minister's evidence regarding exclusion and reasonably concluded that the Minister had not met the requisite onus with credible and trustworthy evidence, and provided adequate reasons in doing so. He adds that the applicant is asking this Court to re-weigh evidence. For instance, the Board's decision to give Gerai's statement little weight was entirely reasonable given its dubious provenance and the Court's guidance regarding affidavits and statutory declarations (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). He concludes that the Minister's allegations against the respondent lacked a credible, trustworthy evidentiary basis and reminds the Court that the Federal Court of Appeal stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 60 that reasonable grounds to believe require a "serious possibility based on credible evidence."
[26]
On the whole, I find the Board's decision to be reasonable. It carefully pondered all of the evidence before it, and its decision "falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in light of the facts and law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47). Serious concerns were raised with respect to the trustworthiness of the evidence submitted by the MPSEP at the hearing before the Board, and so it was open to the Board not to exclude the respondent, despite his credibility issues.
[27]
The documentary evidence shows that the Interpol Red Notice emanates from its National Central Bureau for Sri Lanka and was issued at the sole request of the Sri Lankan Criminal Investigation Department. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan authorities issued their own arrest warrant after having obtained a statutory declaration made by Gerai. Not only was that declaration undated and unsigned, but it contained a certain number of inconsistencies as well as sufficient information to support the finding that the respondent and the person referred to by Gerai as Karthik, are two different individuals. For example, Karthik had travelled to India and eventually migrated to France. However, the MPSEP's verifications with the authorities of these countries revealed that the respondent has never visited either country. This seriously weakens the MPSEP's evidence.
[28]
A finding that a claimant is excluded from the possibility of presenting an asylum claim based on Article 1F(
a
) of the
Convention
is a severe one. It has to be based on a serious and convincing finding of fact.
[29]
Having applied the proper pre- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test, it was open to the Board to find that the Minister had not adduced sufficient evidence to support the exclusion of the respondent. Moreover, the applicant's burden would only become more difficult to meet should this case be sent back to the Board, as the latter would be bound to apply the new test.
Are there special reasons for the Court to order costs against the applicant?
[30]
Now that the applicant has withdrawn his challenge of the Board's finding that the respondent, if not excluded, would be considered a
sur place
refugee, the respondent bases his request for costs on the simple fact that the Board's decision was reasonable. According to him, the Minister's decision to challenge it in these particular circumstances was unfair, oppressive and improper.
[31]
Rule 22 of the
Federal Court Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules
, SOR/93-22 provides that the Court may only award costs for "special reasons." This threshold is high. Costs may be granted "if one party has unnecessarily or unreasonably prolonged proceedings, or where one party has acted in a manner that may be characterized as unfair, oppressive, improper or actuated by bad faith" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This application for judicial review raised arguable issues (leave was, after all, granted by this Court), and so does not meet that threshold.
Conclusion
[32]
The applicant has not convinced the Court that the Board's decision was unreasonable and so this application for judicial review will be dismissed. No question of general importance was proposed by the parties and none will be certified.
JUDGMENT
[33]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed;
2. No question of general importance is certified; and
3. No costs are granted.

Le Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ministre] sollicite le contrôle judiciaire d'une décision en date du 5 février 2013 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [la Commission] a déclaré que le défendeur, un réfugié tamoul sri lankais qui était arrivé au Canada à bord de l'
Ocean Lady
, n'était pas exclu du champ d'application de l'article 98 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la Loi]. La Commission a fait droit à la demande d'asile sur place du demandeur et lui a par conséquent reconnu la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention en vertu de l'article 96.
[2]
Au cours des derniers mois, notre Cour a rendu plusieurs décisions portant sur des demandes d'asile présentées par des passagers tamouls sri lankais voyageant à bord de l'
Ocean Lady
et du
Sun Sea
, des navires ayant accosté au Canada à la fin de 2009 et au milieu de 2010 (voir la décision rendue par la juge Gleason dans l'affaire
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  pour un survol en date de novembre 2013, de la jurisprudence récente sur la question).
[3]
Au départ, le ministre contestait également la conclusion d'inclusion tirée par la Commission. Il s'est depuis désisté de ce moyen. Le ministre conteste maintenant exclusivement la conclusion de la Commission à la non-exclusion du défendeur en faisant valoir qu'il existe des raisons sérieuses de penser que le défendeur aurait été complice d'un crime contre l'humanité au sens de l'alinéa 1F
a
) de la Convention en raison de ses liens avec les Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul [les TLET]. L'alinéa 1F
a
) de la Convention a été incorporé à l'article 98 de la Loi, qui est la loi constitutive de la Commission. Depuis la décision rendue par la Commission, la Cour suprême du Canada a explicité en quoi consistait le critère de la complicité en excluant de son champ d'application les cas de « simple association » ou d'« acquiescement passif » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[4]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire sera rejetée.
Contexte
[5]
La demande d'asile du défendeur était fondée sur sa présumée crainte de persécution et sur le risque d'être torturé par les autorités sri lankaises en raison de sa possible participation aux activités des TLET et qu'il ait des liens avec eux.
[6]
Le défendeur et les membres de sa famille auraient été arrêtés et interrogés à diverses reprises par les autorités sri lankaises pour savoir s'ils avaient participé aux activités des TLET et pour les interroger sur ce qu'ils savaient des TLET. En avril 2008, le défendeur a déménagé à Colombo dans l'espoir de se rendre plus tard en Arabie saoudite pour se trouver du travail comme menuisier. Il affirme qu'alors qu'il était à Colombo, il a prêté son téléphone cellulaire à un homme avec lequel il partageait une chambre et qu'il connaissait très peu. Cet homme aurait utilisé son téléphone cellulaire entre avril et septembre 2008. Suivant la propriétaire de l'immeuble où il habitait à l'époque, des policiers, qui cherchaient le défendeur à Colombo, se seraient présentés chez elle au début de septembre 2008 alors que ce dernier était absent. Le défendeur a réussi à se soustraire à la police et il est allé s'installer pour une courte période de temps dans une autre maison avant de quitter le pays pour Singapour le 11 septembre 2008.
[7]
Le défendeur a passé onze jours à Singapour avant de quitter pour la Malaisie. Il est ensuite demeuré en Malaisie jusqu'en août 2009.
[8]
Pendant qu'il se trouvait en Malaisie, il a appris de sa mère que sa photographie avait été publiée dans un journal avec celle de dix autres individus soupçonnés d'avoir importé de l'équipement de communication électronique pour les TLET. Son frère jumeau aurait, à la suite de la publication de cette photographie, été arrêté, torturé et interrogé en vue de lui faire dire où se trouvait son frère.
[9]
En janvier 2009, le défendeur a présenté une demande d'asile au bureau des Nations Unies en Malaisie. Sa demande a été acceptée en juillet 2009. Alors qu'il n'avait ni statut de résident permanent ni permis de travail, le défendeur a pris des dispositions pour venir au Canada à bord de l'
Ocean Lady
. Il est embarqué à bord du navire le 5 septembre 2009 et il est arrivé au Canada en octobre 2009.
[10]
Lors de l'audition de la demande d'asile du défendeur, le ministre de la Sécurité publique et de la Protection civile (le ministre) est intervenu et a présenté des observations au sujet de l'exclusion du défendeur en vertu de l'alinéa 1F
a
) de la
Convention
. Le ministre maintenait que le défendeur avait été complice de crimes de guerre ou de crimes contre l'humanité en raison de ses liens avec les TLET, qui est une organisation, qui, selon le gouvernement canadien, se livre à du terrorisme. Le ministre a fondé ses observations sur les éléments de preuve suivants:
1. un mandat d'arrestation daté du 19 mai 2009 délivré contre le défendeur pour avoir [traduction] « aidé et encouragé l'organisation des TLET »;
2. une notice rouge d'Interpol indiquant que le défendeur était recherché pour avoir [traduction] « aidé et encouragé l'organisation des TLET »;
3. une photographie du défendeur avec l'inscription « terrorisme » sous la rubrique « infractions »;
4. une copie d'un règlement de l'État sri lankais interdisant l'importation de certaines marchandises, et plus précisément de matériel de détection d'explosif, avec les articles en question encerclés en rouge;
5. une transcription de la déposition faite par un certain Anthony Pullay Tony Gerai [Gerai], à la suite de son arrivée à Colombo muni de matériel interdit, en l'occurrence, de l'équipement de télécommunication de haute technologie. C'est cette déposition qui a conduit la police sri lankaise à tenter d'arrêter le défendeur;
6. le rapport final du Service des enquêtes criminelles du Sri Lanka;
7. l'identification, par le défendeur, de son propre numéro de téléphone cellulaire, qui était identique à celui d'un certain « Karthik », le contact de Gerai;
8. de présumées similitudes entre le nom du défendeur et celui de Karthik, qui, suivant le demandeur, sont une seule et même personne;
9. la crédibilité générale du récit du défendeur en ce qui concerne l'utilisation que son colocataire aurait faite de son téléphone cellulaire, sa description de son colocataire et, de façon plus générale, le récit général de son séjour à Colombo.
[11]
Le demandeur a admis à l'audience qui s'est tenue devant la Commission, que, si le défendeur n'était pas exclu de la protection des réfugiés, la preuve était suffisante pour démontrer qu'il serait exposé à un risque à son retour au Sri Lanka.
[12]
L'un des articles versés au dossier que le ministre a soumis à la Commission mentionnait expressément que les autorités sri lankaises étaient au courant du fait que le défendeur se trouvait au Canada, qu'il avait voyagé à bord de l'
Ocean Lady
et qu'il avait présenté une demande d'asile au Canada. Il relevait également que le demandeur était « traqué » par les autorités sri lankaises. Suivant la preuve documentaire, il était également évident que les individus soupçonnés par les autorités sri lankaises d'entretenir des liens avec les TLET étaient exposés au risque d'être persécutés au Sri Lanka.
La décision contestée
[13]
La Commission a conclu que le ministre ne s'était pas acquitté du fardeau qui lui incombait l'alinéa 1F
a
) sous le régime de la Convention et elle a conclu que le demandeur d'asile n'était pas exclu de la protection accordée aux réfugiés. Le ministre devait démontrer qu'il existait des « raisons sérieuses de penser » que le demandeur d'asile avait commis un des crimes visés à l'alinéa 1F
a
) de la
Convention
. Toutefois, il n'y avait pas suffisamment d'éléments de preuve dignes de foi pour pouvoir conclure que le demandeur d'asile avait lui-même participé aux activités des TLET.
[14]
La Commission a notamment conclu qu'il existait des différences marquées entre le nom « Karthik » et celui du demandeur d'asile, de sorte que la conclusion du ministre suivant laquelle Karthik et le défendeur étaient une seule et même personne n'était pas appuyée par la preuve. La preuve ne permettait pas non plus de conclure que Karthik était le nom de code ou un alias du demandeur d'asile.
[15]
Dans l'intervalle, des accusations avaient été portées contre le demandeur d'asile au Sri Lanka en vertu du Règlement sur l'état d'urgence, qui a été abrogé en août 2011. L'infraction qui lui était reprochée est par conséquent caduque.
[16]
Par ailleurs, la Commission a accordé peu de poids à la déclaration solennelle de Gerai, étant donné qu'elle ne portait ni signature ni date et qu'on y trouvait de nombreuses incohérences en ce qui concerne les dates et la façon d'orthographier les mots (par exemple, le nom du fonctionnaire qui aurait rédigé les notes était écrit de trois façons différentes), et ce, « particulièrement à la lumière des éléments de preuve dont le tribunal dispose qui font état que les forces sri lankaises sont connues pour utiliser la torture pendant les interrogatoires ».
[17]
La Commission avait certaines réserves au sujet de la crédibilité du demandeur d'asile, notamment en ce qui a trait à son affirmation qu'il ne parlait pas avec son colocataire, compte tenu du fait qu'ils avaient partagé la même pièce pendant des mois. Quoi qu'il en soit, la Commission a également conclu, notamment en raison des admissions du ministre, que, si le demandeur d'asile n'était pas exclu de la protection des réfugiés, la preuve était suffisante pour établir qu'il serait exposé à un risque s'il devait retourner au Sri Lanka. Par conséquent, le demandeur s'est vu reconnaître la qualité de réfugié sur place au sens du
Guide des procédures et critères à appliquer pour déterminer le statut de réfugié
du Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés en raison du fait qu'il était venu au Canada à bord de l'
Ocean Lady
et du battage médiatique entourant cette traversée.
Questions en litige et norme de contrôle applicable
[18]
Comme nous l'avons déjà vu, le demandeur a abandonné son argument relatif à la question de l'inclusion. Par conséquent, la présente demande soulève les questions suivantes:
1. La Commission a-t-elle eu raison de conclure que le ministre n'avait pas présenté suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles et dignes de foi pour s'acquitter du fardeau qui lui incombait quant à la question de l'exclusion?
2. La Commission a-t-elle motivé suffisamment sa décision?
3. Existe-t-il des raisons spéciales justifiant la Cour de condamner le demandeur aux dépens?
[19]
La question de sa voir si la décision est suffisamment motivée peut être subsumée sous la première question.
[20]
Les parties s'entendent pour dire que la norme de contrôle applicable à la première question est celle de la décision raisonnable. La Cour a jugé que les conclusions de complicité en matière de crimes contre l'humanité sont des questions mixtes de fait et de droit qui appellent « une retenue considérable » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 47,
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
Analyse
La Commission a-t-elle eu raison de conclure que le ministre n'avait pas présenté suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles et dignes de foi pour s'acquitter du fardeau qui lui incombait quant à la question de l'exclusion?
[21]
Le demandeur affirme que la Commission disposait de suffisamment d'éléments de preuve établissant un lien entre le défendeur et les TLET pour pouvoir l'exclure en vertu de l'alinéa 1F
a
) de la Convention, et ce, même si l'on appliquait le nouveau critère énoncé par la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Dans cet arrêt, la Cour a redéfini le critère de la complicité en expliquant que la simple association ou l'acquiescement passif ne suffisaient plus pour justifier l'exclusion ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 29).
[22]
Le ministre a soumis plusieurs éléments de preuve clés pour justifier une conclusion d'exclusion. Il convient particulièrement de signaler que le demandeur fait valoir que le défendeur avait été personnellement nommé et identifié dans une notice rouge d'Interpol ainsi que dans un mandat d'arrestation du Sri Lanka, qui indiquaient tous les deux qu'il était recherché pour avoir [traduction] « aidé à encourager l'organisation des TLET ». Notre Cour a reconnu que, dans certains cas, une preuve démontrant l'existence d'un mandat valide délivré par un pays étranger peut démontrer de façon convaincante que le critère préliminaire des « raisons sérieuses de penser » a été rempli. En pareil cas, lorsque la preuve portant sur l'existence d'un mandat est le seul élément de preuve invoqué, la Commission doit aller plus loin et déterminer si le demandeur d'asile est crédible. Compte tenu des réserves que la Commission avait au sujet de la crédibilité du défendeur, le demandeur estime que la Commission a commis une erreur en ne concluant pas que le demandeur était exclu de la protection des réfugiés (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
Le demandeur affirme en outre que la Commission n'a pas motivé sa décision de ne pas tenir compte de la notice rouge d'Interpol.
[24]
Enfin, le demandeur maintient qu'en parlant de son contact, « Karthik », Gerai désignait en fait le défendeur, puisque ce dernier a reconnu le numéro de téléphone cellulaire de Karthik était celui du défendeur.
[25]
Quant au défendeur, il affirme que la Commission a soigneusement examiné les éléments de preuve présentés par le ministre au sujet de l'exclusion et qu'elle a raisonnablement conclu que le ministre ne s'était pas acquitté du fardeau qui lui incombait de présenter suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles et dignes de foi, et que la Commission a suffisamment motivé sa conclusion. Suivant le défendeur, le demandeur demande à la Cour de réévaluer la preuve. Par exemple, la décision de la Commission d'accorder peu de poids à la déclaration de Gerai était entièrement raisonnable, compte tenu de sa provenance douteuse et des consignes que la Cour doit suivre en ce qui concerne les affidavits et les déclarations solennelles (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le défendeur conclut que les allégations formulées par le ministre contre lui ne reposaient pas sur des éléments de preuve crédibles et dignes de foi et il rappelle à la Cour que, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour d'appel fédérale a déclaré, au paragraphe 60, que la norme des « raisons sérieuses de penser » est une norme de preuve qui suggère « la croyance légitime à une possibilité sérieuse en raison de preuves dignes de foi ».
[26]
Dans l'ensemble, j'estime que la décision de la Commission est raisonnable. Elle a soigneusement examiné les éléments de preuve qui lui ont été présentés, et sa décision « appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47). De sérieuses réserves avaient été exprimées au sujet de la fiabilité des éléments de preuve soumis par le ministre à l'audience tenue devant la Commission, de sorte qu'il était loisible à la Commission de ne pas exclure le défendeur, malgré les réserves qu'elle avait au sujet de sa crédibilité.
[27]
Il ressort de la preuve documentaire que la notice rouge d'Interpol provenait de son bureau central national du Sri Lanka et qu'elle avait été publiée uniquement à la demande du Service des enquêtes criminelles du Sri Lanka. Par ailleurs, les autorités sri lankaises avaient décerné leur propre mandat d'arrestation après avoir obtenu la déclaration solennelle de Gerai. Non seulement cette dernière déclaration ne portait ni date ni signature, mais elle renfermait plusieurs incohérences et suffisamment de renseignements pour qu'on puisse conclure que le défendeur et l'individu que Gerai appelait Karthik sont deux personnes différentes. Par exemple, Karthik s'était rendu en Inde pour ensuite immigrer en France. Toutefois les vérifications effectuées par le ministre auprès des autorités des pays en question avaient révélé que le défendeur n'avait jamais visité l'un ou l'autre pays, ce qui affaiblit sérieusement la preuve présentée par le ministre.
[28]
La décision de priver le demandeur d'asile de la possibilité de présenter une demande d'asile par application de l'alinéa 1F
a
) de la
Convention
est une grave décision. Elle doit être fondée sur des conclusions de fait sérieuses et convaincantes.
[29]
Suivant le critère applicable avant l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il était loisible à la Commission de conclure que le ministre n'avait pas présenté suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour justifier l'exclusion du défendeur. De plus, le fardeau dont le demandeur aurait à s'acquitter serait encore plus lourd si l'affaire devait être renvoyée à la Commission, parce que cette dernière serait obligée d'appliquer le nouveau critère.
Existe-t-il des raisons spéciales justifiant la Cour de condamner le demandeur aux dépens?
[30]
Comme le demandeur ne conteste plus la conclusion de la Commission suivant laquelle s'il n'est pas exclu, le défendeur sera considéré comme un réfugié sur place, le défendeur fonde sa réclamation de dépens sur le simple fait que la décision de la Commission était raisonnable. À son avis, la décision du ministre de la contester était, eu égard aux circonstances particulières de l'espèce, inéquitable, oppressive et inappropriée.
[31]
Selon l'article 22 des
Règles de la Cour fédérale en matière d'immigration et de protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-232, il doit exister des « raisons spéciales » pour que la Cour adjuge des dépens dans le cas d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire. Le critère est exigeant. La Cour peut adjuger des dépens en raison de l'existence de raisons spéciales « si une partie a inutilement ou de façon déraisonnable prolongé l'instance ou lorsqu'une partie a agi d'une manière qui peut être qualifiée d'inéquitable, d'oppressive, d'inappropriée ou de mauvaise foi » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire soulève des questions sérieuses (notre Cour a, après tout, autorisé la présentation de la demande) et le critère préliminaire applicable n'a donc pas été rempli.
Dispositif
[32]
Le demandeur n'a pas convaincu la Cour que la décision de la Commission était déraisonnable. Par conséquent, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire sera rejetée. Aucune question d'importance générale n'a été proposée par les parties et aucune ne sera certifiée.

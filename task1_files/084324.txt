de Montigny, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Entitlement Appeal Panel (Appeal Panel) of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board (VRAB) refusing Anne Cole's (the Applicant) application for a disability pension, for the claimed condition of major depression, pursuant to paragraph 21(2)(
a
) of the
Pension Act
, RSC 1985, c P-6 and section 25 of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
, SC 1995, c 18 (the
VRAB Act
). The decision was rendered on September 10, 2012 although the Applicant claims to have only been notified of the decision on October 6, 2012.
[2]
For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss this application for judicial review.
Facts
[3]
The Applicant enrolled in the Canadian Forces (CF) in February 1986. She was medically discharged in February 2007 on account of four conditions, only one of which (major depression and chronic dysthymia with obsessive compulsive traits) constitutes the ground of the present application. Although otherwise fit to serve, she was deemed to be undeployable for requiring more than minimal medical support.
[4]
It appears from the various medical and psychological reports that the Applicant had a difficult childhood. She was taken care of by her grandmother, who always pushed her towards success and overachievement, two personal characteristics she seems to have valued throughout her life.
[5]
It is acknowledged by both parties that the Applicant's Report of Physical Examination at the time of her enrolment in the CF did not reveal any issues in relation to depression. Not long after her enrolment, the Applicant claims she was asked to provide location choices for posting. She was finally transferred to Trenton, Ontario, which she submits was not one of the locations that she was offered to choose from; she had requested a posting to Lahr, Germany. She felt disappointed, angry and surprised, which led to the first diagnosis of depression, characterized as a "reactive depression" or "situational depression", rendered in 1987.
[6]
This situation was eventually resolved, and she was commissioned from the ranks to obtain a degree in Business Administration from the University of New Brunswick which she successfully completed in 1993 as a mother of two infants. The Applicant's husband was deployed to the Gulf War for the majority of the Applicant's first pregnancy.
[7]
For eight years after enrolling (1986-1994), the Applicant served without any diagnosis of major depression or other mental illness. In May 1994, she was notified that she had been selected to be the Officer in charge of the Ambulance Platoon deploying on a United Nations tasking in the former Yugoslavia. She undertook the necessary training for the deployment and was told by training officers that she was performing well. In September 1994, her Deputy Commanding Officer advised her that she was removed from the operation, and was told that there was double-booking for the role. The timing of the decision had the additional consequence of making her ineligible to join her home unit on their deployment to Rwanda to assist in combating the cholera epidemic at the time.
[8]
This situation triggered a "situational crisis", for which the Applicant sought medical treatment. She claims that she felt stigmatized for not having been deployed. The diagnosis was later upgraded to major depression. Despite therapy and medication, the Applicant's illness continued. To avoid this stigmatizing work environment, the Applicant was transferred to a new job.
[9]
In 1999, the Applicant suffered the deepest crisis of depression to date following two administrative decisions. First, the Applicant received a poor Personnel Evaluation Report (PER). She felt disappointed and shocked, since she had been working hard and had received positive feedback. She believed it was wrong as it did not accord with earlier positive PERs and feedback she received in general, and it was written by a new supervisor who had only known her a few months. Second, she was chosen in September 1999 for a posting to Washington, DC, for which she immediately undertook the training. She also terminated a pregnancy out of fear that she would be removed from the posting if she was pregnant. She additionally initiated a formal grievance process to remove the poor PER from her file so her record would reflect her consistent good performance, and to ensure there would be nothing on her record that could compromise her deployment. Eventually, she succeeded in having the entire PER removed from her file. Yet in March 2000, the Applicant was informed that she had been removed from the posting in Washington, DC.
[10]
The Applicant claims that this loss of opportunity, the stress created by the grievance process, her abortion, and her husband being deployed to Israel during that period are the reasons for her collapse into a second episode of major depression.
[11]
In 2002, the Applicant applied for a disability pension for the claimed condition of adjustment disorder. The Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) denied the entitlements on January 12, 2003. An Entitlement Review Panel of the VRAB also denied the application on October 27, 2003, claiming that there was no link between the alleged condition and the Applicant' service duties.
[12]
The Applicant claims that she experienced further work related issues that caused her stress. First, she says she frequently saw her supervisor who removed her from the Washington, DC posting, and felt it was a "continuous reminder of the hurt [she] experienced". Second, she submits that she had to fight for a full seven days of bereavement leave in 2004 after the death of her father.
[13]
In addition, the medical and psychological reports indicate, as also acknowledged by the Applicant, that she had been having marital issues for many years, for which she had been seeking therapy. She underlines, among other issues, her husband's drinking problem. The Applicant had also been facing issues with her daughter, who had been having drug problems and experiencing suicidal thoughts.
[14]
From September 2000 to 2007, the Applicant had treatments with a psychiatrist (Dr Kelly) and various psychologists (Dr Sims, Dr Chambers and Dr O'Connor). She has been taking anti-depressant medications, and has been retrospectively diagnosed with dysthymia or chronic depression.
[15]
After her discharge from the CF, the Applicant applied to the DVA for disability benefits for major depression. On July 10, 2007 the DVA denied the application, on the basis that there was a lack of evidence showing that the military service duties caused or contributed to the development and/or aggravation of the depression. On June 17, 2008, this decision was confirmed by an Entitlement Review Panel of the VRAB. The Entitlement Review Panel reviewed all the evidence and noted that the Applicant had numerous other stressors other than factors related to her military service, including her childhood, her mother, her father, marital tension and her abortion. The Panel determined that it "cannot conclude that service factors were the causative factors of the claimed condition and cannot see a permanent worsening from these factors" (Applicant's Record, p 204).
[16]
In 2011, the Applicant retained Dr Harrison, a registered clinical psychologist, to review her medical and psychological history and make a professional judgment as to whether her mental health was adversely affected by her service. In her report, Dr Harrison assessed her conversations with Ms Cole, the results of the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory test administered to the Applicant, and the medical history.
[17]
Dr Harrison notes that the evidence showed a long history of treatment for depression, with the first diagnosis of major depression being in 1995, a second in 2000 by Dr Girvin, and a third in 2004 by Dr Kelly. Through psychotherapy, the treating psychiatrists and psychologists uncovered and identified a psychological background of difficulties with mood and maladaptive coping, and a family history of depression. The reports also identify various family, marital as well as workplace stressors and issues over the years. In his conclusions and recommendations, Dr Harrison states:
Looking at the pattern of Ms. Cole's episodes of depression, it is clear that issues related to her employment with the Canadian Forces exacerbate her symptoms. Specifically, she has strong negative reactions to the loss of assignments (or deployments), which she believed she was preparing for and had been selected for. In fact, aside from two examples excerpted from her childhood, employment related issues appear to be closely associated with Ms. Cole's worst episodes of depression. [...]
It is ironic that Ms. Cole was released from the Canadian Forces because she was no longer deployable when they had not deployed her outside of Canada since 1998. It also seems to confirm that deployment is an important benchmark of a career in the Canadian Forces. This leads to understanding of the issue of disappointment and feared failure faced by Ms. Cole when her deployments were cancelled. Without explanation for not being deployed when she had been selected and was preparing, Ms. Cole was rightfully disappointed. The unfortunate make up of her personality and vulnerability of her mood lead her to more serious episodes of depression than would be the norm for her situation. Nevertheless, I do not believe that her reactions can be dismissed as over reaction to minor disappointments in her life.
In conclusion, Ms. Cole is an individual vulnerable to recurrent episodes of depression due to her psychological background and family history of depression. Psychodynamically, she is an individual who is conflicted around a key issue of autonomy vs. dependence. She further struggles with low self-esteem, over use of intellectualization, an angry sense of feeling unimportant and a longing to be nurtured. Despite two childhood episodes of difficulty dealing with disappointment, Ms. Cole developed through adolescence and early adulthood without becoming depressed. It wasn't until she was in her early thirties and facing the cancellation of a highly prized (in her mind) posting that when was first diagnosed with Major Depression. However, she recovered from this episode and was posted to Italy for three months in 1998. When she once again was not supported for a posting she had been preparing for and believed she had been selected for in 1999, Ms. Cole experienced depression and an exacerbation of her maladaptive beliefs about herself. Her treatment has been lengthy and her improvement uneven and yet, she has persisted with the recommended treatments. I believe it must be seen that these events in her military service contributed to her depression along with her predisposing maladaptive personality and the vulnerability of her mood.
Applicant's Record, pp 239-240
[18]
In July 2012, Ms Cole appealed to the VRAB Entitlement Appeal Panel, and she submitted Dr Harrison's report as new medical evidence. On September 10, 2012, the Appeal Panel confirmed the decision of the Review Panel and concluded that no entitlement should be granted. On November 5, 2012, the Applicant presented her application for judicial review of the Appeal Panel's decision.
The impugned decision
[19]
The Applicant's position before the Appeal Panel was that her condition was triggered by work stressors as referenced in numerous documentary reports on her medical file. Particular emphasis was placed on three events: her failure to obtain a posting to Yugoslavia in 1994, a perceived negative PER in August 1999, and a decision that she would not be posted to Washington, DC in March 2000.
[20]
The Appeal Panel reviewed all the evidence on file. It set out a detailed summary of this review in its decision, making particular reference to the specific medical reports noted by the Applicant's advocate before the panel. The Appeal Panel was also mindful of the statutory obligation to resolve any doubt in the weighing of evidence in favour of the Applicant as per sections 3 and 39 of the
VRAB Act
. However, as stated by the Appeal Panel, "[t]he onus is on the Appellant to demonstrate to the Board that military factors caused and/or aggravated the claimed condition" (Applicant's Record, p 31).
[21]
The Board recognized that the Applicant had experienced work conflict during her career, and noted the various references to work events in the Applicant's psychological treatment reports. However, the Board was not convinced that these work issues were the source of her depression. While the Board sympathized with the Applicant's feelings of disappointment, it was of the view that the records on file did not reveal that her superiors had deliberately not deployed her or prevent any advancement in her career, nor that the military were even aware of the Applicant's feelings towards not being deployed.
[22]
The Board also stated:
Throughout the Appellant's psychotherapy treatment sessions, there was one overriding theme which dominated the reports. This was the theme of low self esteem, the desire to achieve success, feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness, etc. While work stressors are noted, they do not appear to take prevalence in the treatment sessions.
[...]
While all these physicians [Dr Kelly, Dr Chambers and Dr O'Connor], who are specialists in their field, do in fact note work related disappointments and dissatisfaction, neither doctor presents any detail or comprehensive analysis of how these work related stressors played a role. Overall, these physicians appear to focus on personality traits, childhood history and marital issues.
Applicant's Record, p 32.
[23]
The Board also took note of Dr Harrison's opinion, but discarded it. It found that it was not particularly helpful to the Applicant's case since it only reviewed her medical and psychological history, and did not indicate whether or not she conducted any psychological testing of her own. The Board concluded that, without the evidence to establish that service factors caused or aggravated the claimed condition, it was unable to find in favour of the Applicant.
Issues
[24]
The present application for judicial review raises the following three issues:
a) What is the applicable standard of review?
b) What is the appropriate standard of causation to be applied?
c) Did the Board err in assessing the evidence and in finding that the Applicant is not entitled to a pension under paragraph 21(2)(
a
) of the
Pension Act
?
Analysis
a) What is the applicable standard of review?
[25]
There is no dispute between the parties that the applicable standard of review is that of reasonableness. The sole issue before the Appeal Panel was whether the Applicant had established that her disability arose out of or was directly connected to her military service. This issue involves both the interpretation of the Appeal Panel's enabling statutes and the application of the law to the facts. This Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have confirmed on a number of occasions that the Appeal Board's weighing of the evidence and interpretation of its statutory scheme is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.
[26]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr Justice Evans (as he then was) dealt squarely with the standard of review to be applied when it is alleged that the Appeal Board erred in finding that an applicant's injury did not "arise out of" or was not "directly connected with" the military service. He found that the Appeal Board was better equipped to deal with such an issue, and that given the context of the statutory scheme designed to enable claims to be decided with the minimum of formality, cost and delay, "the words defining entitlement indicate that on an application for judicial review considerable deference should be given to the Board's decision" (at para 26). He went on to state that a reviewing court should resist the temptation to manufacture questions of principle when the statutory language is non-technical and relatively open-textured as is the case with paragraph 21(2)(
a
) of the
Pension Act
(at para 42). As he put it:
To "legalize" the process by breaking into a series of questions of "interpretation" what ought to be an exercise in assessing the factual situation as a whole seems to me apt to undermine Parliament's intention that decision making by the administrative tribunals determining pension entitlement should be accessible, informal, cost-effective and expeditious.
( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 43)

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[27]
When applying the standard of reasonableness, the Court must refrain from substituting its own opinion for that of the Appeal Board. The decision must stand unless the reasoning process is flawed and the resulting decision falls outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
b) What is the appropriate standard of causation to be applied?
[28]
The Applicant submits that the Appeal Board erred by failing to explain what standard of causation it applied and how it applied to the Applicant's case. Paragraph 21(2)(
a
) of the
Pension Act
reads as follows:
Service in militia or reserve army and in peace time
(2) In respect of military service rendered in the non-permanent active militia or in the reserve army during World War II and in respect of military service in peace time,
(a) where a member of the forces suffers disability resulting from an injury or disease or an aggravation thereof that arose out of or was directly connected with such military service, a pension shall, on application, be awarded to or in respect of the member in accordance with the rates for basic and additional pension set out in Schedule I;
Milice active non permanente ou armée de réserve en temps de paix
(2) En ce qui concerne le service militaire accompli dans la milice active non permanente ou dans l'armée de réserve pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale ou le service militaire en temps de paix:
a) des pensions sont, sur demande, accordées aux membres des forces ou à leur égard, conformément aux taux prévus à l'annexe I pour les pensions de base ou supplémentaires, en cas d'invalidité causée par une blessure ou maladie - ou son aggravation - consécutive ou rattachée directement au service militaire;
[29]
Relying on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  counsel for the Applicant argued that this provision includes two standards of causation: "arose out of" requires an applicant to establish only a causal connection, not a proximate relationship between the military service and the disability, whereas "directly connected to" would have an applicant establish that the military service caused or contributed to the injury pursuant to the "but for" test. In other words, an applicant is not required to prove sole or direct causation.
[30]
I have already dealt with this issue in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and I see no need to revisit my finding in that case. That decision was followed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[31]
There is no doubt that social welfare legislation must be liberally construed, and section 2 of the
Pension Act
as well as sections 3 and 39 of the
VRAB Act
explicitly prescribe a broad and generous construction and interpretation of these two statutes:
Pension Act

Construction
2. The provisions of this Act shall be liberally construed and interpreted to the end that the recognized obligation of the people and Government of Canada to provide compensation to those members of the forces who have been disabled or have died as a result of military service, and to their dependants, may be fulfilled.

2. Les dispositions de la présente loi s'interprètent d'une façon libérale afin de donner effet à l'obligation reconnue du peuple canadien et du gouvernement du Canada d'indemniser les membres des forces qui sont devenus invalides ou sont décédés par suite de leur service militaire, ainsi que les personnes à leur charge.

(b) accept any uncontradicted evidence presented to it by the applicant or appellant that it considers to be credible in the circumstances; and
(c) resolve in favour of the applicant or appellant any doubt, in the weighing of evidence, as to whether the applicant or appellant has established a case.

c) il tranche en sa faveur toute incertitude quant au bien-fondé de la demande.
[32]
That being said, due regard must be given to the language chosen by Parliament, and the
Pension Act
must be interpreted coherently. It is well established that each section of a statute must be considered in light of the other provisions of that statute. As Mr Justice Beetz stated in
R v Nabis
, [1975] 2 SCR 485, "... legal interpretation must tend to integrate various enactments into a coherent system rather than towards their discontinuity". See also Pierre-André Côté with the collaboration of Stéphane Beaulac and Mathieu Devinat,
The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada
, 4th ed (Toronto: Carswell, 2011) at pp 326 and following.
[33]
As I noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraph 21(2)(
a
) of the
Pension Act
is obviously narrower in scope than paragraph 21(1)(
a
), which applies during war or special duty service. While the latter refers to an injury or disease "that was
attributable to or was incurred
during such military service", paragraph 21(2)(
a
) refers instead to an injury or disease "that
arose out of or was directly connected
with such military service". The Court must therefore strive to give effect to that difference in wording.
[34]
It is clear that the disease or injury (or the aggravation thereof) need not be directly connected to the military service, as the connecting word "or" is used in paragraph 21(2)(
a
) to link "directly connected" with "arose out of". At the same time, it would clearly not be sufficient for a claimant to solely show that he or she was serving in the armed forces at the time, as it would presumably be if the claim was made pursuant to paragraph 21(1)(
a
). This is precisely the conclusion reached by the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, the Court found that "... while it is not enough that the person was serving in the armed forces at the time, the causal nexus that a claimant must show between the death or injury and military service need be neither direct nor immediate" (at para 29). See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[35]
In other words, I agree with the Applicant that paragraph 21(2)(
a
) does not require proof of a direct connection, but I disagree that some kind of causal connection would be sufficient or that military service was
among
the contributing causes to her disability. It seems to me that the words "arising out of" and the overall context of the statute call for something more than some nexus or causal connection, and require that the military service be the main or prevalent cause of the disease or injury, or at the very least a significant factor. Another way of putting it might be to say that the injury or disease would not have occurred
but for
the military service.
[36]
This is precisely the standard that the Appeal Board applied in its decision. Even though the Appeal Board did not state explicitly the causation paradigm it was applying, it emerges from its analysis (and especially from the two quotes reproduced at paragraph 22 of these reasons) that it was not convinced the Applicant would not be suffering from major depression had it not been for the work stressors and the workplace difficulties she encountered throughout her military career. This interpretation of paragraph 21(2)(
a
) was clearly reasonable and consistent with the prevailing jurisprudence on this issue. The Appeal Board was not requiring the Applicant to prove sole or direct causation, as alleged by the Applicant, but was looking for evidence that the military factors played a primary or major role in the aggravation or onset of her claimed condition. In doing so, the Appeal Board made no reviewable error.
c) Did the Board err in assessing the evidence and in finding that the Applicant is not entitled to a pension under paragraph 21(2)(
a
) of the
Pension Act
?
[37]
The Applicant claimed that the Appeal Board did not adequately deal with the evidence submitted, and failed to give any reason for its cursory treatment of crucial evidence. To support her allegation, she presented five arguments.
[38]
First, it is alleged that the Appeal Board disregarded evidence that was favourable to her, most notably the Medical Attendance Reports contemporaneous with the loss of the deployments to the former Yugoslavia and Washington, DC, the reports of Dr Sims and the report of Dr Harrison. She acknowledges that the Appeal Board is presumed to have dealt with all the evidence and is not required to make an explicit finding on each element which leads to its ultimate conclusion. However, she submits that this presumption was rebutted on the basis that the Appeal Board failed to refer to the evidence in the Analysis/Reasons of its decision despite having referred to it in the Arguments/Evidence portion. She believes the Appeal Board only gave cursory consideration of that evidence and came up with general findings, thereby depriving her of insight or understanding into how it arrived at its decision denying her entitlement.
[39]
Second, the Applicant contends that the Appeal Board seized on and gave greater, undue weight to evidence that it interpreted to be unfavourable to her. In particular, the Appeal Board allegedly gave undue weight to the Pyschotherapy Reports, which it interpreted as suggestive of other causes of the major depression in order to find that there was doubt as to the cause of the disability. In taking this approach, the Appeal Board overtly ascribed more weight to these reports than to the favourable evidence noted above.
[40]
Third, the Applicant also asserts that the Appeal Board failed to take into account the particularities of the mental health context. She underlines that it is virtually impossible to entirely divorce work stress and personal stress, nor should one have to do so when seeking treatment or pension entitlement. She also mentions that her pre-existing condition of dysthymia should not defeat her depression claim.
[41]
Fourth, the Applicant argues that the Appeal Board was wrong in rejecting Dr Harrison's report. Contrary to the reasons proffered by the Appeal Board for doing so, the Applicant notes that Dr Harrison clinically interviewed her, thoroughly reviewed the medical evidence, conducted her own tests and analysis, and gave a considered professional opinion. Moreover, Dr Harrison does not merely suppose the possibility of causation, as the Appeal Board intimated, but unequivocally finds that the events in the Applicant's military service contributed to her depression.
[42]
Finally, the Applicant is of the view that the Appeal Board failed to draw the proper inferences in her favour. She claims that the Appeal Board misapplied subsection 39(
a
) of the
Pension Act
and failed to draw from all the circumstances of the case and from the evidence every reasonable inference in her favour. The fact that work stressors are at least as prevalent in her medical reports as the personal stressors or the personality traits, when viewed in light of a liberal interpretation of paragraph 21(2)(
a
) of the
Pension Act
, should have led the Appeal Board to infer that there is sufficient evidence of a causal connection between the disability and the work stressors.
[43]
Of course, the Applicant's contention that the Appeal Board erred in assessing the evidence is intertwined with, and dependent on, her view that she only needed to prove that her military service was only one of the contributing causes of her disability. Since I have already dealt with the standard of causation to be applied, I shall only focus in the following paragraphs on the reasonableness of the Appeal Board's treatment of the evidence.
[44]
The Appeal Board properly acknowledged its obligation under section 39 of the
VRAB Act.
[45]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,
supra
, the Federal Court of Appeal noted that section 39 ensures that the evidence submitted by an applicant in support of a pension application is considered "in the best light possible" (at para 5). As noted by the Respondent, however, the Court of Appeal also emphasized that this provision "does not relieve the pension applicant of the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities the facts required to establish the entitlement to a pension" (
ibid
). The Court of Appeal went on:
[6] Nor does section 39 require the Board to accept all evidence presented by the applicant. The Board is not obliged to accept evidence presented by the applicant if the Board finds that evidence not to be credible, even if the evidence is not contradicted, although the Board may be obliged to explain why it finds evidence not to be credible [...] Evidence is credible if it is plausible, reliable and logically capable of proving the fact it is intended to prove.
See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 33.
[46]
I agree with the Respondent that the weight to be given to the evidence must be left to the Board. Absent a palpable error in the assessment of the evidence or an erroneous finding of fact "made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it" (
Federal Courts Act
, RSC 1985, c F-7, paragraph 18.1(4)(d)), this Court should refrain from intervening even if it may have come to a different conclusion. In the case at bar, I have been unable to find such an error. There was ample evidence upon which the Appeal Board could find that the Applicant had not demonstrated a sufficient causal link between her condition and her military service. Relying on the evidence of Dr Kelly, Dr Chambers and Dr O'Connor, the Appeal Board accepted that work related stressors were prevalent throughout the documentation on file and that the Applicant experienced work conflict during her military career, but was not convinced that these work issues were the source of her depression or took prevalence in the treatment sessions undergone by the Applicant. To the contrary, the Appeal Board determined that low self-esteem, the desire to achieve success, feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness are the overriding theme which dominated the psychotherapy reports. This finding was clearly open to the Appeal Board, on the basis of the evidence that was before it.
[47]
As for Dr Harrison's report, the Appeal Board duly considered it and quoted extensively from it (see pp 29-31 of the decision). The Appeal Board nevertheless decided to give it little weight, first because "it merely documents the [Applicant]'s history as provided to her by the [Applicant]", and second because "she does not indicate whether or not she conducted any psychological testing on which she bases her opinion". Once again, I am unable to find that the Appeal Board treatment of that evidence is faulty.
[48]
I note, first of all, that Dr Harrison's finding is not, strictly speaking, at odds with the Appeal Board's conclusion. In her report, Dr Harrison stated at the very end that "...these events in her military service contributed to her depression along with her predisposing maladaptive personality and the vulnerability of her mood" (Applicant's Record, p 240). As previously mentioned, the Appeal Board does not disagree with that finding but opined that it was insufficient to ground the Applicant's claim for a pension under paragraph 21(2)(
a
) of the
Pension Act
.
[49]
Moreover, this opinion was obtained by the Applicant in contemplation of the appeal to the Appeal Board. This Court has held that less weight is to be given to statements made in contemplation of or at the time of the claim, as opposed to statements made prior to a claim: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 21. In those circumstances, it was all the more reasonable for the Appeal Board to prefer the earlier evidence of Dr Kelly, Dr Chambers and Dr O'Connor.
[50]
For all of the foregoing reasons, I am therefore of the view that the Appeal Board could reasonably conclude, on the basis of the evidence that was before it, that the Applicant's medical condition was not caused by her military service.
Conclusion
[51]
The Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Board's decision falls outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes. While the situation of the Applicant is obviously sympathetic, it is not the role of this Court to substitute its own opinion for that of the Appeal Board, absent a reviewable error of fact or law. Having carefully reviewed the record and the submissions of both parties, I have not been persuaded that the Appeal Board made such an error.
JUDGMENT
[52]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
this application for judicial review is dismissed, with costs.

, LC 1995, c 18, (la Loi sur le TAC). La décision a été rendue le 10 septembre 2012, mais la demanderesse dit n'en avoir reçu notification que le 6 octobre suivant.
[2]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, je suis d'avis de rejeter la demande de contrôle judiciaire.
Les faits
[3]
La demanderesse s'est enrôlée dans les Forces canadiennes (FC) en février 1986 et en a été libérée pour des raisons médicales en février 2007 parce qu'elle souffrait de quatre affections, dont une seule (dépression majeure et dysthymie chronique à caractère obsessionnel compulsif) constitue le fondement de la présente demande. Bien qu'elle ait été jugée par ailleurs apte à servir, il a été établi qu'elle ne pouvait faire l'objet d'un déploiement parce qu'elle nécessitait davantage qu'un soutien médical minimal.
[4]
Il appert des différents rapports médicaux et psychologiques que la demanderesse a eu une enfance difficile. Elle a été prise en charge par sa grand-mère, qui l'a toujours poussée à la réussite et au dépassement, deux caractéristiques personnelles qu'elle semble avoir valorisées toute sa vie durant.
[5]
Les deux parties reconnaissent que le Rapport d'examen physique établi au moment où la demanderesse s'est enrôlée dans les FC n'a révélé aucun problème lié à la dépression. Peu après avoir rejoint l'armée, la demanderesse prétend qu'on l'a priée d'indiquer ses choix parmi plusieurs endroits où elle était susceptible d'être affectée. Elle a finalement été transférée à Trenton (Ontario) alors que cet endroit, selon ce qu'elle prétend, ne faisait pas partie de ceux qui lui avaient été proposés; elle souhaitait être affectée à Lahr (Allemagne). Elle en a éprouvé de la déception, de la colère et de la surprise, ce qui a mené au premier diagnostic de dépression, qualifiée plus précisément de « dépression réactionnelle » ou « dépression situationnelle » en 1987.
[6]
La situation a fini par s'arranger, et la demanderesse a été commissionnée du rang afin de s'inscrire à un programme d'administration des affaires de l'Université du Nouveau-Brunswick; elle a obtenu son diplôme en 1993 alors qu'elle était mère de deux enfants en bas âge. Son époux avait fait l'objet d'un déploiement dans le cadre de la guerre du Golfe pendant la majeure partie de sa première grossesse.
[7]
La demanderesse a servi dans l'armée pendant huit ans après son enrôlement (1986-1994), sans recevoir de diagnostic de dépression majeure ou d'autre maladie mentale. En mai 1994, elle a été avisée qu'elle avait été désignée comme officier responsable du peloton ambulancier dans le cadre d'une mission des Nations Unies en ancienne Yougoslavie. Elle a suivi la formation nécessaire en vue du déploiement, et les officiers de l'instruction lui ont fait savoir que sa performance était satisfaisante. En septembre 1994, son commandant adjoint l'a informée qu'elle était retirée de l'opération, et qu'il y avait eu double affectation. Compte tenu de la date de cette décision, il se trouvait par ailleurs qu'elle ne pouvait plus rejoindre son unité d'appartenance qui allait être déployée au Rwanda pour combattre l'épidémie de choléra qui sévissait à cette époque.
[8]
Cet état de fait a engendré une « crise situationnelle » que la demanderesse a reçu des soins médicaux. Elle affirme qu'elle s'est sentie stigmatisée parce qu'elle avait été exclue du déploiement. Un nouveau diagnostic plus grave de dépression majeure a par la suite été établi. Malgré la thérapie et les médicaments, la maladie de la demanderesse a persisté. Pour la soustraire à cet environnement de travail stigmatisant, la demanderesse a été mutée à un nouvel emploi.
[9]
En 1999, deux décisions administratives ont plongé la demanderesse dans la crise dépressive la plus grave qu'elle ait connue. Elle a d'abord reçu un mauvais rapport d'appréciation du personnel (RAP), ce qui l'a déçue et bouleversée parce qu'elle travaillait fort et qu'elle avait reçu des commentaires favorables. Elle a trouvé cela injuste, étant donné que le document contredisait les RAP favorables précédents et les commentaires qu'elle recevait en général; ce rapport émanait d'un nouveau superviseur qui ne la connaissait que depuis quelques mois. Par ailleurs, elle a été choisie en septembre 1999 pour une affectation à Washington, D.C. en vue de laquelle elle a immédiatement amorcé sa formation. Elle a également mis fin à sa grossesse, craignant que ce poste ne lui soit retiré si elle était enceinte. D'autre part, elle a entamé une procédure formelle de règlement des griefs pour supprimer la mention d'un niveau de rendement faible dans son RAP, de manière à ce que son dossier fasse état d'une bonne performance constante et ne contienne rien qui puisse empêcher qu'elle fasse l'objet d'un déploiement. Finalement, elle est parvenue à faire intégralement retirer le RAP de son dossier, mais en mars 2000 la demanderesse a été informée qu'elle ne serait plus affectée à Washington, D.C..
[10]
La demanderesse soutient que cette perte d'opportunité, le stress lié aux procédures de règlement des griefs, son avortement, et le déploiement dont son mari avait fait l'objet en Israël durant cette période, expliquent son effondrement et son second épisode de dépression majeure.
[11]
En 2002, la demanderesse a demandé une pension d'invalidité pour cause de trouble d'adaptation, que le ministère des Anciens combattants (ACC) a refusée le 12 janvier 2003. Un comité d'appel de l'admissibilité du TAC a également rejeté la demande le 27 octobre 2003, au motif qu'il n'existait aucun lien entre l'affection alléguée et les fonctions remplies durant le service.
[12]
La demanderesse prétend avoir rencontré d'autres problèmes d'ordre professionnel qui lui ont occasionné du stress. D'une part, elle croisait fréquemment le superviseur qui lui avait retiré l'affectation à Washington, D.C., ce qui était un [traduction] « rappel constant des douleurs [qu'elle avait] subies ». D'autre part, elle soutient qu'elle a dû se battre pour obtenir sept jours complets de congé de deuil en 2004 après le décès de son père.
[13]
De plus, comme elle le reconnaît elle-même, les rapports médicaux et psychologiques indiquent qu'elle avait des soucis conjugaux depuis de nombreuses années et qu'elle suivait une thérapie en vue de les régler. Elle évoque, entre autres difficultés, l'alcoolisme de son mari et les problèmes de drogue et les idées suicidaires de sa fille.
[14]
De septembre 2000 à 2007, la demanderesse s'est fait traiter par un psychiatre (Dr Kelly) et divers psychologues (les Drs Sims, Chambers et O'Connor). Elle prend des antidépresseurs et a reçu un diagnostic rétrospectif de dysthymie ou dépression chronique.
[15]
Après sa libération des FC, la demanderesse a réclamé à ACC des prestations d'invalidité pour cause de dépression majeure. Le 10 juillet 2007, le ministère a refusé la demande au motif qu'il n'avait pas été établi que les fonctions liées au service militaire avaient provoqué l'évolution et/ou à l'aggravation de la dépression ou y avaient contribué. Le 17 juin 2008, cette décision a été confirmée par un comité d'appel de l'admissibilité du TAC. Celui-ci a noté, après avoir examiné toute la preuve, que la demanderesse était aux prises avec de nombreux facteurs de stress n'ayant pas de lien avec son service militaire, qui concernent notamment son enfance, sa mère, son père, des tensions conjugales et son avortement. Le comité a estimé qu'il [traduction] « ne pouvait pas conclure que les facteurs liés au service avaient causé l'affection alléguée ni une aggravation permanente » (dossier de la demanderesse, page 204).
[16]
En 2011, la demanderesse a retenu les services de Mme Harrison, une psychologue clinique, afin qu'elle passe en revue ses antécédents médicaux et psychologiques et donne un avis professionnel sur la question de savoir si son service militaire avait nui à sa santé mentale. Dans son rapport, Mme Harrison évalue ses conversations avec Mme Cole, les résultats du test d'inventaire clinique multiaxial de Millon qu'elle lui a administré, ainsi que ses antécédents médicaux.
[17]
Mme Harrison note que la demanderesse a de longs antécédents de traitements antidépresseurs, un premier diagnostic de dépression majeure ayant été posé en 1995, un deuxième en 2000 par le Dr Girvin, et un troisième en 2004 par le Dr Kelly. Dans le cours de la psychothérapie, les psychiatres et psychologues traitants ont découvert et établi une histoire psychologique caractérisée par des troubles de l'humeur et des mécanismes d'adaptation mésadaptés, ainsi que des antécédents familiaux de dépression. Le rapport fait également état de divers facteurs de stress d'ordre familial, conjugal et professionnel et d'autres difficultés étalés dans le temps. Dans ses conclusions et recommandations, Mme Harrison déclare:
[traduction]
S'agissant des cycles dépressifs de Mme Cole, il est manifeste que les difficultés liées à son emploi dans les Forces canadiennes exacerbent ses symptômes. Plus précisément, elle réagit très mal à la perte des affectations (ou à son exclusion d'un déploiement) pour lesquelles elle estime s'être préparée et pense avoir été choisie. En fait, à part deux exemples issus de son enfance, ses difficultés d'ordre professionnel semblent étroitement liées aux pires épisodes dépressifs de Mme Cole. [...]
Il est ironique que Mme Cole ait été libérée des Forces canadiennes parce qu'elle ne pouvait plus faire l'objet d'un déploiement alors qu'elle n'a pas été envoyée à l'extérieur du pays depuis 1998. Cela semble d'ailleurs confirmer aussi que la participation à un déploiement est une étape importante dans une carrière au sein des Forces canadiennes. Cela permet de comprendre la déception et la crainte de l'échec ressenties par Mme Cole lorsque les déploiements dont elle était censée faire l'objet ont été annulés. N'ayant reçu aucune explication bien qu'elle ait été choisie et qu'elle se préparait, Mme Cole a été, à juste titre, déçue. Les malencontreux attributs de sa personnalité et la vulnérabilité de ses humeurs la plongent dans des épisodes dépressifs beaucoup plus graves que ce qui serait normal dans sa situation. Néanmoins, je ne pense pas que ses comportements puissent être simplement qualifiés de réactions excessives à des déceptions mineures.
En conclusion, Mme Cole est une personne sujette à des épisodes dépressifs récurrents en raison de son histoire psychologique et de ses antécédents familiaux de dépression. D'un point de vue psychodynamique, elle est déchirée entre les sentiments cruciaux d'autonomie et de dépendance. Elle est aux prises avec une faible estime de soi, une intellectualisation excessive, une colère liée au fait de se sentir peu importante et à un besoin d'encouragement. Malgré deux épisodes durant l'enfance où elle a eu du mal à gérer une déception, Mme Cole est passée à travers l'adolescence et le début de l'âge adulte sans souffrir de dépression. Le premier épisode de dépression majeur n'a été diagnostiqué qu'au début de la vingtaine, après l'annulation d'une importante (à ses yeux) affectation. Cependant, elle s'en est remise et a été affectée en Italie pendant trois mois en 1998. Lorsqu'une fois de plus en 1999, elle n'a pas été retenue pour l'affectation en vue de laquelle elle se préparait et pour laquelle elle croyait avoir été choisie, Mme Cole a souffert de dépression et ses sentiments d'inadaptation se sont exacerbés. Elle est traitée depuis longtemps, et ses progrès sont inégaux, mais elle a continué de suivre les recommandations de traitement. J'estime qu'il faut reconnaitre que les événements qui ont eu lieu durant son service militaire ont autant contribué à sa dépression que les prédispositions liées à sa personnalité mal adaptée et la vulnérabilité associée à ses humeurs.
Dossier de la demanderesse, pages 239 et 240
[18]
En juillet 2012, Mme Cole a interjeté appel devant le comité d'appel de l'admissibilité du TAC et lui a soumis le rapport de Mme Harrison ainsi que de nouveaux éléments de preuve médicaux. Le 10 septembre suivant, le comité d'appel a confirmé la décision du comité et conclu qu'il n'y avait pas lieu d'octroyer une pension. Le 5 novembre 2012, la demanderesse a présenté sa demande de contrôle judiciaire à l'encontre de la décision du comité d'appel.
La décision contestée
[19]
La demanderesse a fait valoir devant le comité d'appel que son affection a été déclenchée par des facteurs de stress professionnels, comme l'indiquent les nombreux rapports documentaires contenus dans son dossier médical. Une importance particulière est accordée à trois événements: l'échec de l'affectation désirée en Yougoslavie en 1994, un RAP perçu comme défavorable en août 1999, et la décision de ne pas l'envoyer à Washington, D.C. en mars 2000.
[20]
Le comité d'appel a passé en revue tous les éléments de preuve au dossier. Dans sa décision, il récapitule en détail cet examen, et renvoie notamment aux rapports médicaux spécifiquement évoqués par le conseil de la demanderesse devant le comité. Le comité d'appel a également tenu compte de l'obligation qu'il a résoudre la preuve en faveur de la demanderesse toute incertitude quant au bien-fondé de la demande, conformément aux articles 3 et 39 de la Loi sur le TAC. Cependant, comme le comité d'appel l'a rappelé, [traduction] « [c] 'est à l'appelante qu'il incombe de démontrer au comité que les facteurs militaires ont causé et/ou aggravé l'affection alléguée » (dossier de la demanderesse, page 31).
[21]
Le comité a reconnu que la demanderesse avait connu des conflits de travail durant sa carrière, et a relevé les diverses mentions des événements d'ordre professionnel dans les rapports de traitement psychologique. Cependant, le comité n'était pas convaincu que ses difficultés professionnelles étaient la source de sa dépression. Tout en compatissant avec ses sentiments de déception, le comité était d'avis que les documents au dossier n'indiquaient pas que ses supérieurs avaient de façon délibérée décider de l'exclure d'un déploiement ou empêcher l'avancement de sa carrière, ni que les Forces étaient même au courant de ce que la demanderesse ressentait à l'idée de ne pas faire l'objet d'un déploiement.
[22]
Le comité a également déclaré ce qui suit:
[traduction]
Tout au long des séances de psychothérapie de l'appelante, un thème prépondérant domine les rapports: la faible estime de soi, le désir de succès, les sentiments d'inaptitude et de désespoir, etc. Bien que des facteurs de stress liés au travail soient signalés, ils ne semblent pas avoir joué un rôle déterminant lors des séances de traitement.
[...]
Bien que tous ces médecins [les Drs Kelly, Chambers et O'Connor], spécialistes dans leur domaine notent effectivement les déceptions et l'insatisfaction liées au travail, aucun d'entre eux n'a présenté d'analyse détaillée ou complète sur le rôle qu'ont joué ces facteurs de stress professionnel. Dans l'ensemble, ils semblent mettre l'accent sur les traits de personnalité de l'appelant, des événements remontant à son enfance et des problèmes conjugaux.
Dossier de la demanderesse, page 32.
[23]
Le comité a également examiné l'avis de Mme Harrison, mais l'a écarté. Il a estimé qu'il n'était pas particulièrement utile dans la mesure où Mme Harrison se contente d'examiner les antécédents médicaux et psychologiques de Mme Cole sans préciser si elle avait ou non effectué elle-même des évaluations psychologiques. Le comité a conclu qu'il ne pouvait rendre de décision favorable à la demanderesse en l'absence d'éléments de preuve établissant que les facteurs liés au service militaire avaient causé ou aggravé l'affection alléguée.
Questions en litige
[24]
La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire soulève les trois questions suivantes:
a) Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
b) Quelle norme de causalité convient-il d'appliquer?
c) Le comité a-t-il commis une erreur en évaluant la preuve et en concluant que la demanderesse n'avait pas droit à une pension au titre de l'alinéa 21(2)
a
) de la
Loi sur les pensions
?
Analyse
a) Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
[25]
Les parties ne contestent pas que la norme de contrôle applicable est celle de la décision raisonnable. La seule question que devait trancher le comité d'appel était de savoir si la demanderesse avait établi que son invalidité était consécutive à son service militaire ou y était rattachée directement. Pour trancher cette question, il faut interpréter la loi habilitante du comité d'appel et appliquer le droit aux faits. Notre Cour et la Cour d'appel fédérale ont confirmé à de nombreuses reprises que l'appréciation des éléments de preuve par le comité d'appel et l'interprétation qu'il fait de sa loi habilitante sont assujetties à la norme de la décision raisonnable.
[26]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Evans (devenu par la suite juge à la Cour d'appel fédérale) s'est précisément interrogé sur la norme de contrôle à appliquer lorsqu'il est allégué que le comité d'appel a conclu à tort que la blessure d'un demandeur n'était pas « consécutive » ou « rattachée directement » au service militaire. Estimant que le comité d'appel était le mieux placé pour examiner cette question et que le régime législatif était conçu pour que les demandes soient tranchées avec un minimum de formalités et de retard, et moyennant un minimum de frais, le juge a déclaré que « les termes utilisés pour définir le droit à une pension montrent que, dans le cadre d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, la décision du Tribunal devrait faire l'objet d'une retenue judiciaire considérable » (au paragraphe 26). Il ajoute que les tribunaux de révision doivent résister à la tentation de formuler des questions de principe lorsque le langage législatif n'est pas technique et relativement ouvert, comme c'est le cas de l'alinéa 21(2)
a
) de la
Loi sur les pensions
(au paragraphe 42). Voici ce qu'il dit à ce sujet:
« Légaliser » le processus en morcelant en une série de questions d' « interprétation » ce qui devrait constituer un exercice d'évaluation de la situation factuelle dans son ensemble me semble susceptible de contrecarrer l'intention du législateur selon laquelle les tribunaux administratifs appelés à se prononcer sur le droit à une pension devraient avoir un processus décisionnel accessible, informel, rentable et rapide.
( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 43)
Voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Canada (Procureur général) c Wannamaker
, 2007 CAF 126, au paragraphe 12 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[27]
Au moment d'appliquer la norme de la décision raisonnable, la Cour doit se garder de substituer sa propre opinion à celle du comité d'appel. La décision doit être maintenue, à moins que le raisonnement ne soit lacunaire et que la décision qui en découle n'appartienne pas aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
b) Quelle norme de causalité convient-il d'appliquer?
[28]
La demanderesse soutient que le comité d'appel a commis l'erreur de ne pas expliquer à quelle norme de causalité il avait recours, et comment elle s'appliquait à son cas. L'alinéa 21(2)
a
) de la
Loi sur les pensions
prévoit:
Milice active non permanente ou armée de réserve en temps de paix
(2) En ce qui concerne le service militaire accompli dans la milice active non permanente ou dans l'armée de réserve pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale ou le service militaire en temps de paix:
a
) des pensions sont, sur demande, accordées aux membres des forces ou à leur égard, conformément aux taux prévus à l'annexe I pour les pensions de base ou supplémentaires, en cas d'invalidité causée par une blessure ou maladie - ou son aggravation - consécutive ou rattachée directement au service militaire;
Service in militia or reserve army and in peace time
(2) In respect of military service rendered in the non-permanent active militia or in the reserve army during World War II and in respect of military service in peace time,
(a) where a member of the forces suffers disability resulting from an injury or disease or an aggravation thereof that arose out of or was directly connected with such military service, a pension shall, on application, be awarded to or in respect of the member in accordance with the rates for basic and additional pension set out in Schedule I;
[29]
L'avocat de la demanderesse a fait valoir, en s'appuyant sur la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  que cette disposition prévoit deux normes de causalité: ainsi, le terme « consécutive » oblige les demandeurs à n'établir qu'un lien de causalité et non un lien étroit entre le service militaire et l'invalidité, alors que l'expression « rattachée directement » impose d'établir que le service militaire a causé la blessure ou y a contribué suivant le critère du facteur déterminant. Autrement dit, les demandeurs ne sont pas tenus d'établir l'existence d'un lien causal unique ou direct.
[30]
Je me suis déjà penché sur cette question dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et je ne vois aucune raison de revenir sur la décision que j'ai rendue dans cette affaire; elle a d'ailleurs été suivie dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[31]
Il ne fait aucun doute que la législation touchant l'aide sociale doit être interprétée de manière libérale; l'article 2 de la
Loi sur les pensions
de même que les articles 3 et 39 de la Loi sur le TAC prescrivent d'ailleurs explicitement d'interpréter ces deux lois de manière libérale et généreuse:

, LRC 1985, c P-6
Règle d'interprétation
2. Les dispositions de la présente loi s'interprètent d'une façon libérale afin de donner effet à l'obligation reconnue du peuple canadien et du gouvernement du Canada d'indemniser les membres des forces qui sont devenus invalides ou sont décédés par suite de leur service militaire, ainsi que les personnes à leur charge.

Principe général
3. Les dispositions de la présente loi et de toute autre loi fédérale, ainsi que de leurs règlements, qui établissent la compétence du Tribunal ou lui confèrent des pouvoirs et fonctions doivent s'interpréter de façon large, compte tenu des obligations que le peuple et le gouvernement du Canada reconnaissent avoir à l'égard de ceux qui ont si bien servi leur pays et des personnes à leur charge.
Règles régissant la preuve

(c) resolve in favour of the applicant or appellant any doubt, in the weighing of evidence, as to whether the applicant or appellant has established a case.
[32]
Cela étant dit, il faut tenir compte du langage employé par le législateur, et la
Loi sur les pensions
doit être interprétée de manière cohérente. Il est bien établi que chaque disposition d'une loi doit être considérée à la lumière des autres dispositions qu'elle contient. Comme le déclarait le juge Beetz dans l'arrêt
R c Nabis
, [1975] 2 RCS 485, « [...] l'interprète des lois doit tendre à leur intégration en un système cohérent plutôt qu'à leur morcellement et à leur discontinuité ». Voir également l'ouvrage rédigé par Pierre-André Côté avec la collaboration de Stéphane Beaulac et Mathieu Devinat,
The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada
, 4e éd. (Toronto: Carswell, 2011), aux pages 326 et suivantes.
[33]
Comme je le notais dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la portée de l'alinéa 21(2)
a
) de la
Loi sur les pensions
est évidemment plus étroite que celle de l'alinéa 21(1)
a
), qui s'applique en temps de guerre ou de service spécial. Tandis que l'alinéa 21(1)
a
) évoque une blessure ou une maladie «
survenue
au cours du service militaire ou
attribuable à celui-ci
», l'alinéa 21(2)
a
) parle plutôt d'une blessure ou d'une maladie «
consécutive ou rattachée directement
au service militaire ». La Cour doit donc s'efforcer de donner effet à cette différence de formulation.
[34]
Il est clair que la maladie ou la blessure (ou leur aggravation) doit être directement liée au service militaire, comme en témoigne la conjonction « ou » à l'alinéa 21(2)
a
) qui vient lier l'expression « rattachée directement » à « consécutive ». En même temps, il va de soi qu'un demandeur ne pourrait se contenter de démontrer qu'il servait dans les Forces armées durant la période pertinente, ce qui est implicite si la demande est présentée au titre de l'alinéa 21(1)
a
). C'est précisément la conclusion à laquelle la Cour d'appel fédérale est parvenue dans l'arrêt
Canada (Procureur général) c Frye
, 2005 CAF 264. Dans cette affaire, la Cour a estimé que « [...] même s'il ne suffit pas de prouver que la personne servait dans les Forces armées à l'époque, il n'est pas nécessaire que le demandeur établisse un lien de causalité direct ou immédiat entre le décès ou la blessure et le service militaire » (au paragraphe 29). Voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[35]
En d'autres termes, je conviens avec la demanderesse que l'alinéa 21(2)
a
) n'exige pas de prouver un lien direct, mais je ne pense pas qu'il suffise d'établir une certaine forme de lien de causalité ou que le service militaire ait été
l'une des
causes qui ont contribué à son invalidité. Il me semble, que le terme « consécutive » et le contexte général de la loi exigent qu'il soit démontré davantage qu'un certain lien ou rapport causal, et que le service militaire doit être la cause principale ou prédominante de la maladie ou de la blessure, ou à tout le moins avoir joué un rôle significatif. On pourrait sans doute tout aussi bien dire qu'il doit être établi que la blessure ou la maladie ne serait pas survenue
n'eût été
le service militaire.
[36]
C'est exactement la norme que le comité d'appel a appliquée dans sa décision. Bien qu'il n'ait pas explicitement énoncé le concept de causalité qu'il a retenu, il ressort de son analyse (et notamment des deux extraits reproduits au paragraphe 22 des présents motifs) qu'il n'était pas convaincu que la demanderesse ne souffrirait pas de toute façon de dépression majeure si elle n'avait pas été exposée aux facteurs de stress liés à son travail et les difficultés professionnelles rencontrées tout au long de sa carrière militaire. L'interprétation de l'alinéa 21(2)
a
) était manifestement raisonnable et conforme à la jurisprudence applicable en cette matière. Contrairement à ce qu'elle affirme, le comité d'appel n'attendait pas d'elle qu'elle établisse un lien causal unique ou direct, mais qu'elle prouve que les facteurs militaires avaient joué un rôle principal ou majeur dans l'aggravation ou l'apparition de l'affection alléguée. Ce faisant, le comité d'appel n'a commis aucune erreur susceptible de contrôle.
c) Le comité a-t-il commis une erreur en évaluant la preuve et en concluant que la demanderesse n'avait pas droit à une pension au titre de l'alinéa 21(2)a) de la
Loi sur les pensions
?
[37]
La demanderesse a fait valoir que le comité d'appel n'a pas examiné adéquatement la preuve soumise et n'a pas justifié l'examen superficiel qu'il a fait de certains éléments de preuve déterminants. La demanderesse a présenté cinq arguments pour étayer son allégation.
[38]
Premièrement, elle prétend que le comité d'appel a écarté des éléments de preuve qui lui étaient favorables, en particulier les carnets de visite médicale remontant à l'époque où sa participation au déploiement dont elle était censée faire l'objet dans l'ancienne Yougoslavie et son affectation à Washington, D.C. ont été annulées, ainsi que les rapports du Dr Sims et de Mme Harrison. Elle reconnaît que le comité d'appel est présumé avoir examiné tous les éléments de preuve et qu'il n'est pas tenu de tirer une conclusion explicite quant à chacun des éléments pour arriver à sa décision finale. Cependant, elle affirme qu'en l'espèce cette présomption est réfutée, car le comité n'a fait aucun renvoi à la preuve dans la partie de sa décision réservée à l'analyse et aux motifs, alors qu'il l'a fait dans la partie concernant les arguments et la preuve. La demanderesse estime que le comité d'appel s'en est tenu à un examen superficiel des éléments de preuve en cause et qu'il a formulé des conclusions générales, empêchant de ce fait la demanderesse de comprendre comment il était parvenu à la décision de lui refuser une pension.
[39]
Deuxièmement, la demanderesse soutient que le comité d'appel s'est arrêté sur des éléments de preuve qu'il a jugés lui être défavorables et leur a accordé plus d'importance qu'à d'autres éléments et un trop grand poids. Plus précisément, le comité d'appel a accordé trop de poids aux rapports de psychothérapie, qui selon lui donnaient à penser qu'il existait d'autres causes à la dépression majeure de la demanderesse, ce qui jetait à ses yeux un doute sur l'origine de l'invalidité. Ce faisant, le comité d'appel a ouvertement accordé plus d'importance à ces rapports qu'aux éléments de preuve favorables susmentionnés.
[40]
Troisièmement, la demanderesse avance que le comité d'appel n'a pas tenu compte des particularités des problèmes de santé mentale. Elle souligne qu'il est quasiment impossible de distinguer tout à fait les facteurs de stress professionnels et personnels, et que nul ne devrait y être tenu au moment de recevoir un traitement ou de demander une pension. Elle note par ailleurs que son affection préexistante de dysthymie ne devrait pas faire échouer sa demande fondée sur la dépression.
[41]
Quatrièmement, la demanderesse fait valoir que le comité d'appel a eu tort de rejeter le rapport de Mme Harrison. Contrairement aux motifs qu'il a fournis pour justifier cette décision, elle rappelle que Mme Harrison lui a fait subir une entrevue clinique, qu'elle a examiné la preuve médicale de manière approfondie, qu'elle a effectué ses propres évaluations et analyses et qu'elle a formulé un avis professionnel motivé. De plus, Mme Harrison ne se contente pas de supposer l'existence d'une cause, comme le suggère le comité d'appel, mais conclut sans équivoque que les événements survenus durant son service militaire ont contribué à sa dépression.
[42]
Enfin, la demanderesse estime que le comité d'appel n'a pas tiré les inférences qui convenaient en sa faveur. Elle affirme qu'il a mal appliqué l'alinéa 39
a
) de la
Loi sur les pensions
et qu'il n'a pas tiré toutes les inférences raisonnables en sa faveur, compte tenu des circonstances de l'affaire et de la preuve. Le fait que les facteurs de stress professionnels soient mentionnés dans ses dossiers médicaux au moins aussi souvent que les facteurs de stress personnels ou que ses traits de personnalité, aurait dû amener le comité d'appel, sur la foi d'une interprétation libérale de l'alinéa 21(2)
a
) de la
Loi sur les pensions
, à conclure que la preuve d'un lien de causalité entre l'invalidité et les facteurs de stress professionnels était suffisante.
[43]
Bien entendu, l'affirmation de la demanderesse voulant que le comité d'appel se soit trompé dans son évaluation de la preuve procède et dépend de l'argument selon lequel il lui suffisait d'établir que son service militaire n'était qu'une des causes ayant contribué à son invalidité. Comme j'ai déjà traité de la norme de causalité applicable, je ne m'attarderai dans les paragraphes suivants que sur le caractère raisonnable du traitement de la preuve par le comité d'appel.
[44]
Le comité d'appel a, comme il se devait, reconnu son obligation aux termes de l'article 39 de la Loi sur le TAC
.
[45]
Dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la Cour d'appel fédérale a relevé que l'article 39 vise à faire en sorte que la preuve soumise par un demandeur à l'appui d'une demande de pension soit examinée « sous le jour lui étant le plus favorable possible » (au paragraphe 5). Comme le relève le défendeur, la Cour d'appel a également souligné que cette disposition « ne dispense pas le demandeur de la charge d'établir, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, les faits nécessaires pour ouvrir droit à une pension » (
ibidem
). La Cour d'appel poursuit:
[6] L'article 39 n'oblige pas non plus le Tribunal à admettre toute la preuve présentée par le demandeur. Le Tribunal n'a pas l'obligation d'accepter des éléments de preuve présentés par le demandeur s'il conclut qu'ils ne sont pas crédibles, et ce, même s'ils ne sont pas contredits. Par contre, il se peut que le Tribunal doive expliquer la raison pour laquelle il conclut que les éléments de preuve ne sont pas crédibles [...]. La preuve est crédible si elle est plausible, fiable et logiquement capable d'établir la preuve du fait en question.
Voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 33.
[46]
Je conviens avec le défendeur que c'est au comité de décider du poids à accorder aux éléments de preuve. À moins que son évaluation ne soit entachée d'une erreur manifeste ou qu'une conclusion de fait erronée ne soit « tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des éléments dont [l'office fédéral] dispose » (alinéa 18.1(4)
d
) de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
, LRC 1985, c F-7), la Cour doit se garder d'intervenir même si elle aurait pu arriver à une conclusion différente. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, je n'ai pas été en mesure de relever une telle erreur. Une quantité considérable d'éléments de preuve ont été présentés au comité d'appel, à partir desquels il pouvait conclure que la demanderesse n'avait pas établi un lien de causalité suffisant entre son affection et son service militaire. À la lumière des avis des Drs Kelly, Chambers et O'Connor, le comité d'appel a reconnu qu'il était surtout question des facteurs de stress liés au travail dans les documents versés au dossier, et que la demanderesse avait connu des conflits de travail durant sa carrière militaire, mais sans être convaincu que ces problèmes d'ordre professionnel étaient la source de sa dépression ou qu'ils s'agissaient des principaux problèmes abordés lors des séances de traitement de la demanderesse. Au contraire, le comité d'appel a déterminé que la faible estime de soi de la demanderesse, son désir de succès, ses sentiments d'insuffisance et de désespoir constituaient le sujet central des rapports de psychothérapie. Il était tout à fait loisible au comité d'appel de parvenir à la conclusion susmentionnée compte tenu de la preuve dont il disposait.
[47]
Quant au rapport de Mme Harrison, le comité d'appel l'a dûment considéré et en a cité de longs extraits (voir les pages 29 à 31 de la décision). Il a néanmoins décidé de ne lui accorder que peu de poids, d'abord parce qu'il [traduction] « documente simplement les antécédents de [la demanderesse] tels qu'ils lui ont été fournis », et ensuite parce qu'[traduction] « elle n'indique nullement si elle a effectué ou non des évaluations psychologiques sur lesquels fonder son opinion ». Encore une fois, je ne vois rien d'erroné dans le traitement que le comité d'appel a réservé à cet élément de preuve.
[48]
Je note tout d'abord que la conclusion de Mme Harrison n'est pas, à strictement parler, incompatible avec celle du comité d'appel. Elle déclare à la toute fin de son rapport que [traduction] « [...] les événements qui ont eu lieu durant son service militaire ont autant contribué à sa dépression que les prédispositions liées à sa personnalité mal adaptée et la vulnérabilité associée à ses humeurs » (dossier de la demanderesse, page 240). Comme je l'ai déjà indiqué, le comité d'appel n'écarte pas cette conclusion, mais estime qu'elle est insuffisante pour fonder la demande de pension de la demanderesse au titre de l'alinéa 21(2)
a
) de la
Loi sur les pensions
.
[49]
De plus, la demanderesse a obtenu l'avis de Mme Harrison en prévision de l'appel devant le comité d'appel. La Cour a estimé que les déclarations faites en vue d'une demande ou au moment où elle est présentée doivent recevoir moins de poids que celles qui lui sont antérieures: voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 21. Dans les circonstances, il était d'autant plus raisonnable que le comité d'appel privilégie la preuve préalable des Drs Kelly, Chambers et O'Connor.
[50]
Pour toutes les raisons qui précèdent, je suis d'avis que le comité d'appel pouvait raisonnablement conclure, sur la base des éléments de preuve dont il disposait, que l'affection médicale de la demanderesse ne découlait pas de son service militaire.
Conclusion
[51]
La demanderesse n'a pas démontré que la décision du comité n'appartenait pas aux issues possibles acceptables. Bien que sa situation mérite évidemment la sympathie, il ne revient pas à la Cour de substituer sa propre opinion à celle du comité d'appel, en l'absence d'une erreur de fait ou de droit susceptible de contrôle. Après avoir attentivement examiné le dossier et les observations des deux parties, je ne puis arriver à la conclusion que le comité d'appel a commis une erreur de cette nature.

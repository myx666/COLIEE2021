 Summary: 
 
 A pre-removal risk assessment officer determined that Ullah would not be subject to risk of torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Pakistan. Ullah applied for judicial review. He requested an order setting aside the decision and remitting the matter back for redetermination by a different officer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court dismissed the application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 O'Keefe, J. 
 : This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection  
 Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the  
 Act 
 ), for judicial review of a decision of a pre-removal risk assessment officer (the officer), dated February 18, 2010, wherein the officer determined that the applicant would not be subject to risk of torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Pakistan.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The applicant requests an order setting aside the decision of the officer and remitting it matter back for redetermination by a different officer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Background  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Mohammad Ahsan Ullah (the applicant) was born on November 24, 1975 and is a citizen of Pakistan.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  The applicant became involved in the political branch of the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM-A) while attending college. He worked on election campaigns and held fundraisers. Because of these activities, he faced threats from members of the terrorist faction known as the MQM Haqiqi (MQM-H). He stayed with friends and returned home infrequently.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  On June 28, 2001, the applicant returned home. Several people, who the applicant alleges were MQM-H members, broke into his house. While attempting to escape, the applicant was shot and wounded. As a result, he has been diagnosed with complete paraplegia.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The applicant entered Canada on October 11, 2001. He applied for refugee status but was found to be ineligible based on subsection 34(1) of the  
 Act 
 . In 2006, he requested Ministerial relief under subsection 34(2) at an inadmissibility hearing of the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The applicant has not received a decision on the relief requested under subsection 34(2) of the  
 Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  The applicant submitted a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) in January 2010. His PRRA application was rejected in March 2010.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Officer's Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The determinative issue for the officer was lack of sufficient objective evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  The officer found that the applicant was someone described in subsection 112(3) of the  
 Act 
  due to his inadmissibility based on his membership in an organization engaged in terrorism as per subsection 34(1) of the  
 Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  The officer found that the applicant provided insufficient evidence that the attack on him was a result of his membership in MQM-A or that the attackers were MQM-H members. The applicant did not provide evidence about how he knew the attackers were MQM-H, how they became aware that he was present at his home and why he would be targeted. The applicant provided a newspaper article that stated that the attack was random and said nothing about it being politically motivated or perpetrated by MQM-H members. The officer found the applicant's statements to be vague and general.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  The officer found that the applicant did not provide sufficient information about his role in MQM-A. The applicant's statement about his activities were very general, he did not provide details about when he worked for MQM, how often or what his position was. The letter from the head of the MQM-A notes only that the applicant was a supporter. The officer concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the applicant fits the profile of a person likely to draw the interest of anyone in Pakistan.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  The officer concluded that the applicant will face the same generalized risk of violence as the entire population and would not likely face a risk of torture, death or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Pakistan.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Issues  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The applicant submitted the following issues for consideration:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. Did the officer err in not deferring removal proceedings pending the determination of the applicant's application for Ministerial relief under subsection 34(2) of the  
 Act 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Did the officer err by not convoking a hearing into the PRRA application of the applicant?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. Did the officer err in law in his or her interpretation and application of the definition of a person in need of protection as defined in section 97 of the  
 Act 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. Did the officer err in law basing his or her decision on an erroneous finding of fact that he made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before him?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 5. Did the officer render a decision that is unreasonable, having regard to the evidence before him or her so as to amount to an error of law?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 6. Did the officer err by ignoring evidence and misinterpreting the evidence including sworn testimony, documentary evidence and human rights records?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  I would rephrase the issues as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. What is the appropriate standard of review?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. Did the officer err in not deferring the applicant's removal from Canada pending a determination of his application for Ministerial relief pursuant to subsection 34(2) of the  
 Act 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. Did the officer err by not holding a hearing pursuant to subsection 113(b) of the  
 Act 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. Did the officer err by ignoring probative evidence?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Applicant's Written Submissions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The applicant submits that the officer erred in not providing reasons for his refusal to defer the proceedings prior to a decision on the application for Ministerial relief made pursuant to subsection 34(2) of the  
 Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  The applicant submits that the officer erred by not convoking an oral hearing. A hearing is required when credibility is in issue. The applicant submits that the officer's finding that there was insufficient objective evidence of the applicant's role with the MQM-A or the identity of his attackers was essentially a finding of credibility and an oral hearing should have been convoked.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  The applicant submits that the officer ignored probative evidence before him. There was much evidence before the officer that the applicant, as a member of the MQM-A, faces a personalized risk not shared with the entire population in Pakistan. The officer made no reference to the documentary evidence which demonstrates that MQM-A members face a personalized risk in Pakistan. The officer therefore erred by ignoring evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Respondents' Written Submissions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  The respondents submit that the applicant did not meet his onus to provide sufficient evidence that his removal to Pakistan would subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment that is not faced generally by other individuals. The applicant failed to submit sufficient objective evidence to indicate how he knew his attackers were MQM-H members, how they became aware of his return home or why he would be targeted. There was further evidence that the attack was random. It was open to the officer to conclude that the applicant had not established a link between his personal circumstances and a risk defined in section 97 of the  
 Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Analysis and Decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Issue 1  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 What is the appropriate standard of review?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  Generally, the standard of review for a PRRA decision overall is that of reasonableness (see  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Issues of procedural fairness arising from the determination of a PRRA application will be determined on the correctness standard, which, typically, includes the right to be heard (see  
 Wang 
  above, at paragraph 11).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  It should be noted that issues regarding the right to be heard arising from the application of subsection 113(b) of the  
 Act 
  are not necessarily reviewed on the correctness standard. As stated by Mr. Justice Yves de Montigny in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> subsection 113(b) of the  
 Act 
  is clear that the Minister is not obligated to grant a hearing. In deciding whether to hold a hearing, the PRRA officer applies the facts to the factors outlined in section 167 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations 
 , SOR/2002-227 (the Regulations). This is a determination of mixed fact and law reviewable on the standard of reasonableness (see  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). However, if there is no indication that the officer turned his mind to the section 167 factors or the issue of whether to hold an oral hearing, this does raise concerns of procedural fairness. As such, the absence of an oral hearing, in the case at bar, should be reviewed on the standard of correctness (see  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 17).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  The other issues raised will be reviewed on the standard of reasonableness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Issue 2  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Did the officer err in not deferring the applicant's removal from Canada pending a determination of his application for Ministerial relief pursuant to subsection 34(2) of the  
 Act 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  The officer deciding the applicant's application was a PRRA officer from Citizenship and Immigration Canada. If the applicant wished to submit a request to defer his removal, this should have been directed to the Canadian Border Services Agency to be assessed by an inland enforcement officer. I have reviewed the applicant's PRRA submissions dated February 1, 2010 and I note that the deferral request is not noted. As well, I have reviewed the certified tribunal record and I did not locate a copy of the letter requesting deferral. It is also important to note that a removal date had not been set at the date of the hearing. It would not make sense to order a deferral of a removal that has not yet been scheduled. Consequently, the officer did not make a reviewable error in failing to defer the applicant's removal pending a determination of his application for Ministerial relief pursuant to subsection 34(2) of the  
 Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Issue 3  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Did the officer err by not holding a hearing pursuant to subsection 113(b) of the  
 Act 
 ?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  When applying for protection, a person may make written submissions in support of their application pursuant to subsections 161(1) and (2) of the Regulations. An oral hearing is not required in the normal course of deciding a PRRA application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  A hearing may be held under subsection 113(b) of the  
 Act 
  if the Minister is of the opinion that a hearing is required based on the factors set out in section 167 of the Regulations. The language of subsection 113(b) signifies that the holding of an oral hearing is always discretionary having regard for the factors identified in section 167 of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The factors to be considered which are set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of section 167 of the Regulations should be read cumulatively.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Mr. Justice Paul Crampton at paragraph 32 states that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Given the presence of the conjunctive word "and" between paragraphs (b) and (c) above, it is clear that the factors set forth in paragraphs 167(a), (b) and (c) are cumulative. ... The parties agree that if all three factors in section 167 were satisfied, a PRRA Officer would be obliged to hold a hearing and that if one of the factors set forth (b) or (c) is not satisfied then a hearing would not be required.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  Thus, based on paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of section 167, an applicant must establish that there is evidence which raises concerns about the applicant's credibility and is related to section 97, that this evidence is central to the decision on the application for protection and that this evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  A finding of insufficient evidence may reveal that the officer was actually concerned about the credibility of the applicant or the evidence. This is noted throughout the Federal Court jurisprudence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Mr. Justice Michael Kelen held that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 In refusing to accord weight to the applicant's story without corroborating evidence, the PRRA Officer, in effect, concluded that the applicant was not credible. In my view, given these credibility concerns, it was incumbent on the Officer to consider the request for an oral hearing and to provide reasons for refusing to grant the request.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  Other examples of officers purporting to reject applicants' applications on the basis of insufficient evidence where they in fact made their decisions based on credibility grounds are found in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 20;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 16).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  Applicants are required under subsection 10(1) of the Regulations to submit all information, documents and evidence required by the Regulations and the  
 Act 
 . As such, it is open to an officer to reject an application on the basis that the applicant has submitted insufficient evidence. I agree with Mr. Justice Crampton's analysis in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> where he states that the cases noted above regarding findings of insufficiency of evidence:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 ... do not stand for the proposition that a PRRA Officer in essence makes an adverse credibility finding every time he or she concludes that the evidence adduced by an Applicant is not sufficient to meet the Applicant's evidentiary burden of proof. In each of those cases, it was clear to the Court that the PRRA Officer either had made a negative credibility finding, or simply disbelieved the evidence presented by the Applicant. This is very different from not being persuaded that an Applicant has met his or her burden of proof on the balance of probabilities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  Simply because the officer in this case made a finding that the applicant had presented insufficient evidence, does not necessarily mean that he made a negative credibility finding.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  The officer noted that the applicant helped with election campaigns and fundraising for MQM-A, but found that the letter from the head of the organization stated that the applicant was only a supporter. The officer also found that the newspaper article submitted by the applicant on the incident where he was shot described the event as a random act.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  The officer found that the applicant presented no evidence on:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. when and how often he did work for MQM-A;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. the nature of the previous threats he received from MQM-H, how often and when these threats occurred and under what circumstances;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. how he knew that the men who shot him were MQM-H members;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. why he believed that the attack on him was a result of his membership in MQM-A; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 5. how the MQM-H members became aware that he was present at his home.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  I have reviewed the material submitted by the applicant in his PRRA application. He did not provide information on any of these points of concern raised by the officer. The only information the applicant presented about his role in MQM-A and the threats he faced from MQM-H was the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 I first became involved in the MQM-A through its student wing , the APMSO, when I started attending college in 19992 or 1993. I have worked for the party in election campaigns and other activities such as fundraising. My MQM-A involvement became such that it was dangerous for me to remain at home. Both my brother (also involved in activities for the MQM) and I faced threats from members of the MQM-H to stop our political activity, and because of these threats we began staying with friends at various homes and only returning to our own home infrequently.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  I would then restate the holding of Mr. Justice Paul Crampton from paragraph 18 of  
 Herman 
  above:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 ... it was reasonably open to the PRRA Officer to conclude, without making an adverse credibility finding, that the evidence adduced was not sufficient to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the claims advanced by the Applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  More specifically, it was reasonable for the officer to conclude that the applicant had not met the onus to establish his membership in the MQM-A nor that he personally faced a risk to his life directly as a result of such membership.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Issue 4  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Did the officer err by ignoring probative evidence?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  The applicant submitted that the officer made no reference to any of the documentary evidence which demonstrates that members of the MQM-A face a personalized risk in Pakistan and that therefore, the officer erred by ignoring evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  However, the officer did not find that members of the MQM-A do not face any risks in Pakistan, which is the crux of the documentary evidence provided by the applicant in his application. Rather, as discussed above, the officer found that there was insufficient evidence regarding the nature of the applicant's involvement in the MQM-A and insufficient evidence about the threats and violence he personally had faced from the MQM-H. I do not find that the officer ignored relevant evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [38] 
  As a result, the application for judicial review must be dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] 
  The applicant did not wish to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification. As a result of my findings on the deferral issue, the respondents did not wish to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 JUDGMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [40] 
   
 IT IS ORDERED that 
  the application for judicial review is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

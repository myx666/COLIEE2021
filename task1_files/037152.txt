 Summary: 
 
 This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2007] F.T.R. TBEd. MY.034. 
 
 
 
 [1] 
   
 Kelen, J. 
 : This is a motion by the plaintiffs for summary judgment in an action for patent infringement with respect to Canadian Patent No. 1,275,282 (the 282 patent) for a modular display fixture that can be used to display clothing or merchandise in a retail store. 
 
 
 
 Facts 
 
 
 
 [2] 
  The plaintiff Tyrone Nagthall is the patentee and registered owner of the 282 patent, which was granted on November 16, 1990 following an application filed by Mr. Nagthall on June 6, 1989. 
 
 
 
 [3] 
  The plaintiff Rachalex Holdings Inc. (Rachalex) carries on business as Vogue Display. It is the exclusive licensee of all rights under the 282 patent and claims under the patentee pursuant to section 55 of the Patent Act, R.S.C 1985, c. P-4 (the Act). 
 
 
 
 [4] 
  The defendants manufacture and sell display fixtures that have all the elements of at least Claims 1 and 10 of the 282 patent. The defendants claim that they did not copy from the plaintiffs’ product and that the 282 patent is invalid. The defendants’ allege invalidity based on the following grounds: 
 
 
 
 1. the invention is disclosed in a prior publication; 
 
 
 
 2. another inventor made the invention first; and 
 
 
 
 3. certain claims in the 282 patent are invalid because the terms used therein are unclear or uncertain. 
 
 
 
 Defendants’ evidence 
 
 
 
 [5] 
  The defendants’ evidence alleges the following: 
 
 
 
 1. The “X-Cell system”, which has been manufactured by Redhawk Industries Inc. (Redhawk) since 1981, is similar to or identical to the plaintiffs’ system. The system was sold throughout the United States by Redhawk and was produced and introduced into Canada in 1987 in the Wolco and Randy River stores. 
 
 
 
 2. The waterfall concept on which the plaintiffs base the 282 patent has been in existence in Canada since the 1950s. Kember Store Metals Limited and others have manufactured and sold the system in Canada. 
 
 
 
 3. According to Claude Robolin, the President of Redhawk, the X-Cell system was invented by Michele Mathiew of Deco Metaux in France during the 1970s. Mr. Robolin was given permission from Mr. Mathiew to produce the system in the United States. 
 
 
 
 4. The plaintiffs’ system copies the X-Cell system. 
 
 
 
 5. The X-Cell system was advertised in the Visual Merchandising and Store Design Magazine at page 182 in October 1989. 
 
 
 
 6. The plaintiffs’ system has been manufactured in Canada by other companies including Concord Metal Canada and Nu Look without any complaints or action by the plaintiffs. 
 
 
 
 7. The X-Cell system was displayed in Europe at the Euroshop in Germany and at Visual Merchandising shows in various cities in the United States before the plaintiffs manufactured and filed their patent application. 
 
 
 
 8. United States Patent No. 3,450,270, which was issued in 1969, discloses the features in item 10 of the 282 patent. 
 
 
 
 Plaintiffs’ evidence 
 
 
 
 [6] 
  The plaintiffs’ evidence alleges the following: 
 
 
 
 1. The Display Bank store at 30 Ordnance Road in Toronto sold on July 29, 2005 a “wall track”, “outrigger track” and a bracket for use on either track. The Display Bank refers to these and other components of this kind of display fixture as their “track system”. 
 
 
 
 2. The Display Bank provides drawings and information about its “track system” on its website at www.thedisplaybank.ca. 
 
 
 
 3. A skilled person would regard the defendants’ outrigger track as having all of the elements of Claim 1 of the 282 patent. 
 
 
 
 4. A skilled person would regard the defendants’ wall track and bracket as having all of the elements of Claim 10 of the 282 patent. 
 
 
 
 5. A skilled person would regard the track waterfall and track floor rack shown on the Display Bank’s website as having all of the elements of Claim 10 of the 282 patent. 
 
 
 
 Issue 
 
 
 
 [7] 
  The issue before the Court is whether the defendants’ allegations raise a genuine issue for trial. 
 
 
 
 The test for granting summary judgment 
 
 
 
 [8] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  I set out the test for granting summary judgment as follows: 
 
 
 
 ¶6 Summary judgment is governed by Rules 213 to 219 of the [Federal Courts Rules, SOR/1998-106], in particular, Rule 216 provides in part: 
 
 
 
 216. (1) Where on a motion for summary judgment the Court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue for trial with respect to a claim or defence, the Court shall grant summary judgment accordingly. 
 
 
 
 (2) Where on a motion for summary judgment the Court is satisfied that the only genuine issue is […] 
 
 
 
 (b) a question of law, the Court may determine the question and grant summary judgment accordingly. 
 
 
 
 (3) Where on a motion for summary judgment the Court decides that there is a genuine issue with respect to a claim or defence, the Court may nevertheless grant summary judgment in favour of any party, either on an issue or generally, if the Court is able on the whole of the evidence to find the facts necessary to decide the questions of fact and law. 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 216. (1) Lorsque, par suite d’une requête en jugement sommaire, la Cour est convaincue qu’il n’existe pas de véritable question litigieuse quant à une déclaration ou à une défense, elle rend un jugement sommaire en conséquence. 
 
 
 
 (2) Lorsque, par suite d’une requête en jugement sommaire, la Cour est convaincue que la seule véritable question litigieuse est : […] 
 
 
 
 b) un point de droit, elle peut statuer sur celui-ci et rendre un jugement sommaire en conséquence. 
 
 
 
 (3) Lorsque, par suite d’une requête en jugement sommaire, la Cour conclut qu’il existe une véritable question litigieuse à l’égard d’une déclaration ou d’une défense, elle peut néanmoins rendre un jugement sommaire en faveur d’une partie, soit sur une question particulière, soit de façon générale, si elle parvient à partir de l’ensemble de la preuve à dégager les faits nécessaires pour trancher les questions de fait et de droit. 
 
 
 
 ¶7 The Court is not to grant summary judgment where it is shown that there is a genuine issue for trial. However, Rule 216(3) specifically permits this Court to grant summary judgment even where there is a genuine issue for trial so long as the Court "is able on the whole of the evidence to find the facts necessary to decide the questions of fact and law." The Federal Court of Appeal has recently reviewed the principles involved in granting summary judgment in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) with approval, and clarifies the role of a motions judge generally, and specifically with respect to the application of Rule 216(3). The Court provides the following relevant guidance  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Estate: 
 
 
 
 1. where an issue of credibility arises from evidence presented, the case should not be decided on summary judgment under rule 216(3) but rather should go to trial because the parties should be cross-examined before the trial judge (see paragraph 32 of MacNeil Estate); 
 
 
 
 2. under rule 216(3), motions judges can only make findings of fact or law provided the relevant evidence is available on the record and does not involve a "serious" question of fact or law which turns on the drawing of inferences (see paragraph 33 of MacNeil Estate); 
 
 
 
 3. Rule 216(3) permits a judge on a motion for summary judgment, after finding that a "genuine issue" exists, to conduct a trial on the affidavit evidence with a view to determining the issues in the action. However, this is not always possible, particularly where there are conflicts in the evidence, where the case turns on the drawing of inferences or where serious issues of credibility are raised (see paragraph 46 of MacNeil Estate); 
 
 
 
 4. Parties responding to a motion for summary judgment do not have the burden of proving all of the facts in their case; rather … responding parties have only an evidentiary burden to put forward evidence showing that there is a genuine issue for trial … (see paragraph 25 of MacNeil Estate).

 Analysis 
 
 
 
 Whether there is a genuine issue for trial 
 
 
 
 [11] 
  Under Rule 216(1) of the Federal Court Rules, I must first determine, on a motion for summary judgment, whether the defence presents no genuine issue for trial or that the issue is so doubtful that it deserves no further consideration. 
 
 
 
 [12] 
  Applying the four principles or guidelines from the McNeil Estate case which I set out in paragraph 8 above and after reviewing the affidavit evidence and the transcripts of cross-examination on affidavits, I conclude that the defendants raise the following genuine issues for trial: 
 
 
 
 1. Was the invention described in the 282 patent already disclosed to the public (i.e., was the invention anticipated?) 
 
 
 
 2. Did someone other than Mr. Nagthall invent the subject matter of the 282 patent before Mr. Nagthall did? 
 
 
 
 I also conclude that partial summary judgment ought to be granted on the issues of infringement and invalidity based on ambiguity. 
 
 
 
 Infringement 
 
 
 
 [13] 
  While the defendants have pleaded that they have not infringed the plaintiffs’ patent, they have put forward no evidence on this motion to contradict the plaintiffs’ expert evidence indicating that the system sold by the defendants infringe claims 1 and 10 of the 282 patent. Nevertheless, in order to find infringement, the Court must construe the patent and determine based on the evidence available whether a skilled person would regard the defendants’ products have all of the elements of claims 1 and 10 of the 282 patent: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 1089. 
 
 
 
 [14] 
  As described in the 282 patent, the plaintiffs’ invention relates to display fixtures having standards to which brackets may be attached. The “background of the invention” reads as follows: 
 
 
 
 Display fixtures are commonly installed in retail stores and like establishments to provide a storage location for merchandise and for the display of merchandise. Typical display fixtures comprise one or more vertical standards with a variety of hooked brackets and so forth which hang from the vertical standards. One particular prior device is a wall shelving system which has rectangular channels or tubes with a series of slots through which hooked brackets can be hung. A disadvantage of this known device is that there tends to be a considerable amount of pivotal sway of the bracket within the slot. 
 
 
 
 A further disadvantage with the prior display fixtures having rectangular channels with a series of slots through them is that the hooks which are hung from these slots bear against the face of the standard containing the slots. With this arrangement, placing a substantial load on the hooked bracket tends to deform the face of the bracket supporting the hook. 
 
 
 
 [15] 
  Claim 1 of the 282 patent describes the following embodiment of the invention: 
 
 
 
 A standard for supporting at least one bracket of a display fixture, said bracket having a recess therein, said standard comprising: 
 
 
 
 a plurality of pairs of elongate sides having opposed generally flat parallel faces, at least one side of said pairs of sides being joined along an edge to the nearest side of the pair of sides adjacent to it; and 
 
 
 
 support elements extending between said faces and supported by said sides; 
 
 
 
 in use, one of said support elements being received in said recess in said bracket and said opposed faces forming restraining surfaces acting against said bracket to limit pivotal movement of said bracket about an axis generally perpendicular to said support elements. 
 
 
 
 [16] 
  The plaintiffs provided an affidavit prepared by Duncan Newman, a mechanical and product design engineer. Mr. Newman was retained by the plaintiffs’ counsel to provide an opinion on the qualifications of a skilled reader of the 282 patent and to inspect the defendants’ items and relate their technical features to the 282 patent. In Mr. Newman’s opinion, a skilled person would consider: 
 
 
 
 1. the defendants’ track waterfall to be a bracket having a recess therein; 
 
 
 
 2. the defendants’ outrigger track as: 
 
 
 
 i. a standard for supporting at least one bracket of a display fixture; 
 
 
 
 ii. having a plurality of pairs of elongate sides having opposed generally flat parallel faces; 
 
 
 
 iii. having at least one side of the pairs of elongate sides joined along an edge to the nearest side of the pair of sides adjacent to it; 
 
 
 
 iv. having support elements extending between opposed generally flat parallel faces of the elongate sides, supported by the sides; and 
 
 
 
 v. in use, one of the support elements being received in the recess of the bracket and the opposed faces form restraining surfaces acting against the bracket to limit pivotal movement of the bracket about an axis generally perpendicular to the support elements. 
 
 
 
 Mr. Newman therefore concluded that a skilled person would regard the defendants’ outrigger track as having all of the elements of claim 1. 
 
 
 
 [17] 
  Mr. Newman also provided an opinion with respect to claim 10 of the 282 patent, which describes the following embodiment of the invention: 
 
 
 
 A display fixture comprising: 
 
 
 
 at least one bracket having a recess therein; and 
 
 
 
 at least one standard having – 
 
 
 
 at least two discrete modular members in parallel spaced relationship, defining at least one pair of opposing parallel flat faces adapted to receive, and slightly wider apart than, the portion of said bracket wherein is said recess, 
 
 
 
 means for holding said members generally upright, 
 
 
 
 a plurality of elements extending between said opposing faces, said elements being of a dimension to be received in said recess of said bracket; 
 
 
 
 in use, said bracket being removably supported on said standard with said portion of said bracket having said recess being closely received between said pair of opposing faces, and said recess receiving one of said elements. 
 
 
 
 [18] 
  In Mr. Newman’s opinion, a skilled person would regard the defendants’ track waterfall and wall standard as: 
 
 
 
 1. a display fixture comprising: 
 
 
 
 i. one bracket having a recess in it; 
 
 
 
 ii. one standard having: 
 
 
 
 1. at least two discrete modular members in parallel spaced relationship that define at least one pair of opposing parallel flat faces, and with these opposing faces adapted to receive, and slightly wider apart than, the recess portion of the bracket; 
 
 
 
 2. means for holding the members generally upright; 
 
 
 
 3. a plurality of elements extending between the opposing faces, and these elements are of a dimension to be received in the recess portion of the bracket; and 
 
 
 
 iii. when in use, 
 
 
 
 1. the bracket is removable; 
 
 
 
 2. the bracket is being supported by receiving within its recess one of the elements that extent between the opposing parallel faces; and 
 
 
 
 3. the portion of the bracket having the recess is being closely received between the pair of opposing parallel faces. 
 
 
 
 Mr. Newman therefore concluded that a skilled person would regard the defendants’ wall standard and track waterfall as having all of the elements of claim 10. Based on diagrams provided on the Display Bank website, Mr. Newman also concluded that a skilled person would regard the track waterfall and track floor rack shown on the website as having all of the elements of claim 10. 
 
 
 
 [19] 
  Faced with no opposing evidence, I am persuaded that based on a purposive construction of the 282 patent and the expert opinion provided by Mr. Newman, the defendants have infringed claims 1 and 10 of the 282 patent. Summary judgment on the issue of infringement will issue accordingly. 
 
 
 
 Defendants’ allegations of invalidity 
 
 
 
 1. Anticipation 
 
 
 
 [20] 
  An invention is anticipated, i.e. not novel, if its essential features are disclosed in a piece of prior art:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 361 (F.C.A.). 
 
 
 
 [21] 
  Under paragraph 27(1)(b) of the Patent Act as it read before October 1, 1989, a publication will invalidate a patent claim if it was published in Canada or in any other country more than two years before the filing date of the application in Canada. If, as the defendants allege, the invention described in the 282 patent was disclosed in a prior publication, the 282 patent is invalid. 
 
 
 
 [22] 
  Moreover, paragraph 27(1)(a) of the Patent Act as it read before October 1, 1989 provides that  
 if the invention was known or used by any other person before the plaintiffs applied for the patent, the plaintiffs are not entitled to file an application for the patent. An important issue for trial is whether the subject of the patent was known or used by any other person before the plaintiff invented it 
 . Paragraph 61(1)(a) provides that a patent would be declared invalid if the invention for which the patent was granted had already been known or used by some other person, or that other person had disclosed or used the invention in such a manner that it had become available to the public. The defendants have adduced evidence purporting to establish that a system known as the X-Cell system was in use and available to the public before the plaintiffs obtained the 282 patent. If the expert evidence establishes that the X-Cell system has the same essential elements as the subject of the patent in this case, then it does not matter whether the publication was less than two years before the application for the plaintiffs’ patent. I am satisfied that the issue of invalidity based on anticipation is a contentious question of fact and law that ought to be considered by the trial judge. Accordingly, the plaintiffs are not entitled to partial summary judgment on this issue. 
 
 
 
 [23] 
  The date of the X-Cell publication was a contentious issue, since the brochure itself is undated. In any event, the brochure for the X-Cell system may not ultimately be considered by the trial judge as publication of the invention because it does not describe the invention in words; it only shows a pictorial representation of the system. In any event and as stated above, the publication may be an irrelevant issue because, pursuant to paragraph 21(1)(a) of the Patent Act, the evidence may prove that the invention was known or used by another person before the plaintiffs applied for the 282 patent. 
 
 
 
 [24] 
  At the hearing of this motion, the Court was referred by the defendants to affidavit evidence about a US 1969 patent which appears to describe the plaintiffs’ invention. The plaintiffs objected to this evidence on the ground that the US patent was not disclosed in the defence or in the defendants’ three replies to the plaintiffs’ demands for particulars. Accordingly, I cannot consider this 1969 US patent on this motion for summary judgment. 
 
 
 
 2. Prior Inventor 
 
 
 
 [25] 
  Subsection 27(1) of the Act provides that a patent may only issue to the inventor of an invention or the inventor’s legal representative. If, as the defendants allege, Mr. Nagthall was not the inventor, the 282 patent is similarly invalid. 
 
 
 
 [26] 
  The conflict in the evidence is that the plaintiff Tyrone Nagthall says he invented the display standard and bracket system. Philip S. David deposed that the owners of Redhawk Industries represented themselves as the inventors. The defendants’ witness Paul Pacheco deposed in his affidavit that the standard bracket system existed in the United States in Canada since 1983. He also deposed that the system was invented by Michele Mathiew in France in the 1970s. This was on the basis of information provided by Claude Robolin, the President of Redhawk Industries. Mr. Pacheco was not cross-examined on his affidavit. The plaintiffs argued that some of this evidence is contradictory double hearsay evidence, but affidavit evidence on information and belief is admissible evidence on a motion for summary judgment. The objections raised by the plaintiffs in this regard underscore the need for a proper assessment of the credibility and weight of the defendants’ evidence. These evidentiary issues need viva voce testimony. While contradictory double hearsay evidence may not be given the same weight as direct evidence, the assignment of such weight is properly left to the trial judge. 
 
 
 
 4. Ambiguity 
 
 
 
 [27] 
  It will be the job of the trial judge to construe the patent and in particular claims 1 and 10. The plaintiffs have demonstrated that the words in these claims alleged to be ambiguous are not so. While I have had difficulty understanding the patent, the patent is supposed to be understood by an expert, i.e. a person well skilled in the art. We have the affidavit expert evidence of Mr. Newman who explains the elements of the patent. The defendants did not produce any expert evidence stating that the language of the patent claims is ambiguous or unclear. The defendants’ allegation is based only on submissions from counsel. Accordingly, I am prepared to grant the plaintiffs partial summary judgment with respect to the issue of ambiguity. 
 
 
 
 3. Obviousness 
 
 
 
 [28] 
  The defendants also argued that the invention described in the 282 patent was obvious. The defendants did not plead obviousness in their defence, and I did not and cannot consider this argument for the purposes of the motion for summary judgment. However, I consider that obviousness would have been an important issue in this case if it had been pleaded. 
 
 
 
 Pleadings 
 
 
 
 [29] 
  As noted above, I have not considered the evidence concerning the 1969 US patent as it pertains to the issue of anticipation or any evidence concerning the issue of obviousness. The US patent was not pleaded as prior art, and obviousness was not pleaded as a basis for invalidity. Since the case is proceeding to trial, the defendants have rights under the Federal Courts Rules to obtain amendments to the pleadings with leave. Under Rule 75, the Court may allow a party to amend its statement of defence on terms that protect the rights of all parties. Generally, the Court will allow the amendment that serves the interest of justice and does not result in an injustice that is not compensable. Whether the defendants would be entitled to amend their statement of defence and their replies to the demands for particulars so as to refer to the 1969 US patent and the pleading of obviousness is an issue for another judge at another hearing. At this stage, I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs should be granted partial summary judgment on these two issues because these issues and the evidence to be considered in their determination are intertwined with the genuine issues for trial: who is the real inventor of this standard and bracket display system, and was the invention anticipated by the prior art. 
 
 
 
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
 [30] 
  For the reasons above, the Court will grant the motion in part and grant summary judgment in favour of the plaintiffs on the following issues: 
 
 
 
 1. the defendants have infringed claims 1 and 10 of the 282 patent; and 
 
 
 
 2. the 282 patent is not invalid on the basis of ambiguity. 
 
 
 
 As the defendants’ allegations of invalidity on the basis of anticipation and prior inventorship raise genuine issues for trial, the plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment on these issues. 
 
 
 
 [31] 
  In light of the divided success, each party will bear its own costs of this motion.

Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
O'Keefe, J.
: The applicants' claims for refugee protection were denied by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board). They now apply for judicial review of that decision pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act].
[2]
The applicants seek an order setting aside the negative decision and returning the matter to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.
Background
[3]
The applicants are a Roma family of three generations from Poland. They arrived in Canada on April 15, 2011 and they asked for refugee protection shortly thereafter. All ten claims relied primarily on the narrative of the father/grandfather, Leslaw Dawidowicz (the principal applicant).
Decision
[4]
The Board denied their claims by a decision dated May 23, 2012.
[5]
The Board began by setting out the applicants' allegations. The applicants feared violence at the hands of skinheads and discrimination amounting to persecution. The principal applicant recounted many incidents to support the claims, including some violent assaults. Their efforts to seek protection have met with mixed results: sometimes the police would do nothing; one time the police arrested their attackers; another time the police detained them instead.
[6]
State protection was the determinative issue and the Board said at paragraph 8 that the issue was "whether Polish authorities can be reasonably expected to provide the claimants with serious efforts at protection if they were to return to Poland, and not whether those authorities can be reasonably expected to provide the claimants with
de facto
effective or
de facto
guaranteed protection." Further, clear and convincing evidence would be required since Poland is a parliamentary democracy.
[7]
Here, the Board found that the applicants had not met that burden. Although local police had failed the applicants on occasion, the Board said that such failures do not amount to a lack of state protection unless they are a symptom of the state's broader inability to protect. Further, the Board found that Poland itself was not an agent of persecution and that it is combating discrimination and offering sufficient protection that the applicants' fears are not well-founded.
[8]
The Board then went on to explain its findings by quoting from a number of sources and it concluded that state protection mechanisms exist and are available for ethnic minorities. For that reason, the applicants' claims failed under both section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act.
Application for Judicial Review
[9]
All ten claimants applied for judicial review. However, four of them (Klaudiusz Dawidowicz, Kornela Klaudia Kowalska, Chanel Irena Kowalsk and Juliano Gabriel Kowalski) have since filed a notice of discontinuance.
Issues
[10]
The applicants submit two issues for my consideration:
1. Did the Board err by failing to reasonably assess the evidence as a whole and not having regard for the totality of the evidence?
2. Did the Board err in the definition and assessment of persecution and state protection?
[11]
The respondent replies that the Board's finding on state protection is reasonable.
[12]
I would rephrase the issues as follows:
1. What is the standard of review?
2. Did the Board misunderstand the tests for persecution and state protection?
3. Was the Board's decision unreasonable?
Applicants' Written Submissions
[13]
The applicants say that the standard of review is reasonableness and that the decision was unreasonable.
[14]
First, the applicants note that the Board did not say anything about the applicants' credibility and should be assumed to have accepted their stories, including those regarding the failure of the police to act. Indeed, at the hearing, the Board took them straight to the issues of state protection and discrimination versus persecution and asked very few questions. The applicants submit that the short hearing was inconsistent with a reasonable consideration of the issues and that suggests it was unreasonable.
[15]
The applicants then say that the Board applied the wrong test. In particular, they take issue with the Board's statement at paragraph 11 that the applicants "do not have a well-founded fear of persecution because of the protections provided by the state and by the European Union within Poland." They suggest that the Board erred by stating this as a causal relationship and for jumping into the state protection analysis without ever assessing whether the cumulative acts of discrimination amounted to persecution (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4th) 68;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] FCJ No 1669 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], and saying that a denial of refugee protection was a reasonable outcome. The applicants say that this is for the Court to determine and the Board was wrong to try and anticipate a judicial review.
[17]
The applicants then go on to challenge the Board's state protection analysis and say it applied the wrong test by only requiring "serious efforts to protect." The applicants say that that is not the test. Rather, the Board was required to look at the operational adequacy or actual effectiveness of those efforts at the present time, which it did not do (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2010] FCJ No 153 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 1637 (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 1545 (QL); and others). In the applicants' view, "adequate" means effective protection, though not in every case and not guaranteed.
[18]
Had the Board applied the right test, the applicants say the sources consulted by the Board show that no such protection exists on an operational level. Rather, they report the following: police corruption; discrimination and violence against the Roma; segregation of the Roma; 80 percent unemployment among Roma; and efforts to improve the situation have had little impact. Further, they say that the Board misconstrued the response to information request. The applicants say the evidence proves the Board wrong and its failure to deal with the contradictory evidence renders the decision unreasonable (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2013] FCJ No 1253 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) at paragraphs 15 to 17, 157 FTR 35).
[19]
Altogether, the applicants submit that the Board's failure to look at operational adequacy and to properly consider their evidence made the decision unreasonable.
Respondent's Written Submissions
[20]
The respondent says the standard of review is reasonableness and the decision was reasonable.
[21]
The respondent says that the onus is on the applicants to rebut the presumption of state protection and that the test is adequacy, not effectiveness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Here, the evidence on Poland's responses to anti-minority incidents were mixed and did not rebut the presumption of state protection. As for the applicants' claim that the Board ignored evidence, the respondent notes that they give no examples of any contradictions between the Board's conclusions and the documentary evidence. There is no reviewable error.
Analysis and Decision
Issue 1
What is the standard of review?
[22]
Where previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[23]
The parties agree that the standard of review for all issues is reasonableness, but I do not. Chief Justice Paul Crampton recently explained the standard of review for decisions on persecution and state protection in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 22, [2013] FCJ No 1099 (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. In essence, since the jurisprudence has developed clear tests for both, a board cannot depart from them. Therefore, where applicants allege that a board misunderstood the test, the standard is correctness and no deference is owed to the board's understanding of the relevant tests. However, where applicants challenge how the tests were applied to the facts, those are questions of mixed law and fact and the standard is reasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 20 to 22;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 1082 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4th) 413 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Here, the applicants allege both types of errors, so I will review the former type for correctness and the latter type for reasonableness.
[24]
When applying the reasonableness standard, I should not intervene if the Board's decision is transparent, justifiable, intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 47; and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 59). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 59 and 61, a court reviewing for reasonableness cannot substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor can it reweigh the evidence.
Issue 2
Did the Board misunderstand the tests for persecution and state protection?
[25]
The applicants' first argument is that the Board failed to consider the well-foundedness of the applicants' fears since it did not assess whether the acts of discrimination cumulatively amounted to persecution. Rather, it assessed only state protection and decided that the fear was not well-founded since state protection exists.
[26]
The Board made no mistake in that regard.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 712, the Supreme Court of Canada said that "if a state is able to protect the claimant, then his or her fear is not, objectively speaking, well-founded." Similarly, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal said the same thing at paragraph 42:
In determining whether refugee claimants have an objective basis for their fear of persecution, the first step in the analysis is to assess whether they can be protected from the alleged persecution by their home state. [...] Where sufficient state protection is available, claimants will be unable to establish that their fear of persecution is objectively well-founded and therefore will not be entitled to refugee status. It is only where state protection is not available that the court moves to the second stage, wherein it considers whether the conduct alleged to be persecutory can provide an objective basis for the fear of persecution.
[27]
The Board was therefore correct to approach the issue the way it did. Having found adequate protection, there was no need to go on to consider whether the cumulative acts of discrimination amounted to persecution since such a finding could not have changed the result.
State Protection Test
[28]
As for the state protection test, the Board made the following statements in its decision:
[6] As states are presumed capable of protecting their citizens, an important issue before me is whether there is clear and convincing evidence that Polish authorities would not, on a balance of probabilities, be reasonably forthcoming with serious efforts to protect the claimants if they were to return to Poland now. It was open to the claimants to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence that adequate protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to them.
...
[8] According to refugee protection law, states only need to provide adequate protection and do not have to provide perfect protection; in other words, states only have to make serious efforts at protection and do not have to provide
de facto
effective or
de facto
guaranteed protection. Therefore, the state protection issue here is only whether Polish authorities can be reasonably expected to provide the claimants with serious efforts at protection if they were to return to Poland, and not whether those authorities can be reasonably expected to provide the claimants with
de facto
effective or
de facto
guaranteed protection.
...
[12] The latest United States of America (US) Department of State country report indicates that the state of Poland does not condone violence or discrimination against ethnic minorities, and it also indicates that Poland is making serious efforts, both in policy and in practice, to combat violence and discrimination against minorities, as follows:
...
[15] Response to an Information Request POL103089.E further indicates the same thing: while state protection for ethnic minorities in Poland is not perfect, adequate protection mechanisms do exist and are available to them.
...
[17] Based upon my review of the objective country conditions documents referenced above, I find that I am not persuaded on a balance of probabilities that Polish authorities would not be reasonably forthcoming with serious efforts to protect the claimants if they were to return to Poland. I therefore find, on the evidence, that the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.
(Footnotes omitted)
[29]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> I wrote:
[26] The Board's decision, however, frequently invokes the "serious efforts" of a state to provide protection. This concept is invoked at least ten times in its decision, including in its stating of the test for refugee status:
According to refugee protection law, home states only need to provide adequate protection and do not have to provide perfect protection: in other words, home states only need to make serious efforts at protection and do not have to provide
de facto
effective or
de facto
guaranteed protection.
[27] The use of the phrase "in other words" in the passage is incorrect: "adequate protection" and "serious efforts at protection" are not the same thing. The former is concerned with whether the actual outcome of protection exists in a given country, while the latter merely indicates whether the state has taken steps to provide that protection.
[28] It is of little comfort to a person fearing persecution that a state has made an effort to provide protection if that effort has little effect. For that reason, the Board is tasked with evaluating the empirical reality of the adequacy of state protection.
[29] This Court has affirmed this interpretation of state protection repeatedly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1589, Mr. Justice Roger Hughes made this clear (at paragraph 8):
Another error of law is with respect to what is the nature of state protection that is to be considered. Here the Member found that Mexico "is making serious and genuine efforts" to address the problem. That is not the test. What must be considered is the actual effectiveness of the protection.
[30]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 153, Mr. Justice Michel Beaudry indicated the same principle (at paragraph 10):
First of all, it weighed the evidence of criticisms of the effectiveness of the legislation against evidence on the efforts made to address the problems of domestic violence. This is not enough to ground a finding of state protection; regard must be given to what is actually happening and not what the state is endeavoring to put in place (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 215 at paragraph 14).
[31] Most recently, Madam Justice Catherine Kane confirmed the same principle in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
The test is not 'perfect' state protection, but adequate state protection. Still, mere willingness to protect is insufficient; state protection must be effective to a certain degree:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm RL (3d) 243 at para. 47.
[32] On this point, therefore, the Board clearly misstated the law. ...
[30]
In the present case, the Board member does make references to "adequate protection" and "serious efforts, both in policy and in practice". However, in paragraph 17 of the decision, the Board clearly applies the "serious efforts" test and in my opinion, paragraph 17 is a central finding in the decision. As well, in paragraph 8 of the decision, the Board also adopts the "serious efforts" test. Based on these statements, I am of the view that the board applied the wrong test with respect to its state protection finding.
[31]
The application for judicial review is therefore allowed and the matter is referred to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.
[32]
Because of my finding on this issue, I need not deal with the remaining issue.
[33]
Neither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.
[34]
The respondent, with the consent of the applicants requested that Klaudiusz Dawidowicz, Kornela Klaudia Kowalska, Juliano Gabriel Kowalski (a.k.a. Julianno Gabrie Kowalski) and Chanel Irena Kowalsk (a.k.a. Chanel Irena Kowalska) be removed as applicants. I will grant this request.
JUDGMENT
[35]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is referred to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.
2. The style of cause is amended by removing Klaudiusz Dawidowicz, Kornela Klaudia Kowalska, Juliano Gabriel Kowalski (a.k.a. Julianno Gabrie Kowalski) and Chanel Irena Kowalsk (a.k.a. Chanel Irena Kowalska) as applicants in this matter.

.........................
Leslaw Dawidowicz, Dawidowicz Dawid (alias Dawid Mojzesz Dawidowicz), Danuta Dawidowicz, Miranda Dawidowicz, Andrzej Dawidowicz et Klaudina Julia  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la Commission) a rejeté la demande d'asile des demandeurs. Ceux-ci demandent maintenant le contrôle judiciaire de la décision en question au titre du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la Loi].
[2]
Les demandeurs sollicitent une ordonnance en annulation de la décision défavorable et le renvoi de l'affaire à un tribunal différemment constitué pour qu'il rende une nouvelle décision.
Contexte
[3]
Les demandeurs sont une famille rom de trois générations de la Pologne. Ils sont arrivés au Canada le 15 avril 2011 et ont demandé l'asile peu après. Les dix demandes d'asile étaient essentiellement fondées sur l'exposé circonstancié du père/grand-père, Leslaw Dawidowicz (le demandeur principal).
Décision
[4]
La Commission a rejeté les demandes d'asile des demandeurs dans une décision datée du 23 mai 2012.
[5]
La Commission a commencé par énoncer les allégations des demandeurs. Les demandeurs craignaient de subir des actes de violence de la part de skinheads et de la discrimination équivalent à la persécution. Le demandeur principal a relaté de nombreux incidents à l'appui des demandes d'asile, y compris des agressions violentes. Les efforts qui sont déployés pour obtenir une protection ont donné des résultats mitigés: parfois, la police n'intervenait pas; une fois, la police a arrêté les agresseurs; une autre fois, c'est eux que la police a détenus.
[6]
La protection de l'État représente la question déterminante, et la Commission a écrit au paragraphe 8 que la question consistait à savoir « s'il est raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que les autorités polonaises déploient de sérieux efforts pour protéger les demandeurs d'asile si ceux-ci devaient retourner en Pologne, et non de savoir s'il est raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que ces autorités leur offrent une protection de fait efficace ou garantie ». De plus, les demandeurs devaient fournir des éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants étant donné que la Pologne est une démocratie parlementaire.
[7]
En l'espèce, la Commission a conclu que les demandeurs ne s'étaient pas acquittés de leur fardeau. Même si la police locale n'avait pas pu protéger les demandeurs à certaines occasions, la Commission a affirmé que ces manquements n'équivalaient pas à une absence de protection de l'État à moins qu'il ne s'agisse de symptômes d'une incapacité générale de l'État de protéger ses citoyens. De plus, la Commission a conclu que la Pologne n'était pas un agent de persécution et qu'elle luttait contre la discrimination et offrait une protection suffisante de sorte que les craintes des demandeurs n'étaient pas fondées.
[8]
La Commission a ensuite expliqué ses conclusions en citant un certain nombre de sources et a conclu que des mécanismes de protection étatiques existaient et étaient offerts aux minorités ethniques. Pour ces raisons, les demandes d'asile des demandeurs ont été rejetées au titre de l'article 96 et du paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi.
Demande de contrôle judiciaire
[9]
Les dix demandeurs d'asile ont demandé le contrôle judiciaire. Cependant, quatre d'entre eux (Klaudiusz Dawidowicz, Kornela Klaudia Kowalsk, Chanel Irena Kowalsk et Juliano Gabriel Kowalski) ont depuis produit un avis de désistement.
Questions en litige
[10]
Les demandeurs soumettent deux questions que je dois trancher:
1. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en omettant d'évaluer raisonnablement les éléments de preuve globalement, sans tenir compte des éléments de preuve dans leur totalité?
2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son interprétation de la définition et dans son évaluation de la persécution et de la protection de l'État?
[11]
Le défendeur soutient que la conclusion de la Commission concernant la protection de l'État est raisonnable.
[12]
Je reformulerais en ces termes les questions en litige:
1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
2. La Commission a-t-elle mal compris les critères applicables à la persécution et à la protection de l'État?
3. La décision de la Commission était-elle déraisonnable?
Observations écrites des demandeurs
[13]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que la norme de contrôle est celle de la raisonnabilité et que la décision était déraisonnable.
[14]
D'abord, les demandeurs soulignent que la Commission ne s'est pas prononcée sur la crédibilité des demandeurs et qu'il y a lieu de présumer qu'elle a accepté leurs prétentions, y compris celles concernant l'incapacité de la police d'intervenir. En fait, pendant l'audience, la Commission a abordé directement avec eux les questions de la protection de l'État et de la discrimination par rapport à la persécution et a posé très peu de questions. Les demandeurs soutiennent qu'une audience courte est incompatible avec un examen raisonnable des questions en litige et soutiennent que la décision était déraisonnable.
[15]
De plus, les demandeurs soutiennent que la Commission a appliqué le mauvais critère. Particulièrement, ils contestent l'affirmation faite par la Commission au paragraphe 11 selon laquelle les demandeurs « ne craignent pas avec raison d'être persécutés, car ils bénéficient de la protection offerte par l'État et l'UE en Pologne ». Ils soutiennent que la Commission a commis une erreur en faisant une telle affirmation à titre de lien de cause à effet et en procédant à une analyse de la protection de l'État sans évaluer si les actes cumulatifs de discrimination équivalaient à de la persécution (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4e) 68;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] ACF no 1669 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 36, 97 Imm LR (3e) 243; notamment).
[16]
Les demandeurs soutiennent de plus que la Commission a clos sa décision en citant l'arrêt
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], et affirmant que le refus d'accorder l'asile constituait une issue raisonnable. Les demandeurs soutiennent qu'une telle conclusion revient à la Cour et que la Commission avait eu tort d'essayer de prédire l'issue d'un contrôle judiciaire.
[17]
Enfin, les demandeurs contestent l'analyse de la protection de l'État effectuée par la Commission et soutiennent que celle-ci a appliqué le mauvais critère en se contentant d'exiger de « sérieux efforts pour protéger ». Selon les demandeurs, il ne s'agit pas du bon critère. La Commission devait plutôt examiner le caractère adéquat au plan opérationnel ou l'efficacité des efforts qui sont présentement déployés, ce qu'elle n'a pas fait (voir notamment
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 15, [2010] ACF no 153 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 42, [2012] CAF no 1637 (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 16, [2012] ACF no 1545 (QL)). De l'avis des demandeurs, le terme « adéquate » signifie une protection efficace, mais pas dans tous les cas, et il ne s'agit pas d'une protection assurée.
[18]
Si la Commission avait appliqué le bon critère, selon les demandeurs, les sources consultées par celle-ci montrent qu'aucune protection n'existe au niveau opérationnel. Elles font plutôt état des éléments suivants: corruption policière; discrimination et violence contre les Roms; ségrégation des Roms; taux de chômage de 80 p. 100 parmi les Roms; et les efforts qui ont été déployés pour améliorer la situation n'ont eu qu'un effet limité. De plus, elles indiquent que la Commission a mal interprété la réponse à la demande d'information. Les demandeurs soutiennent que les éléments de preuve montrent que la Commission s'est trompée et que le défaut de celle-ci de prendre en considération les éléments de preuve contradictoires rend la décision déraisonnable (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 30, [2013] ACF no 1253 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), aux paragraphes 15 à 17, 157 FTR 35).
[19]
Globalement, les demandeurs soutiennent que l'omission de la Commission d'examiner le caractère adéquat au plan opérationnel et de dûment examiner les éléments de preuve qu'ils ont présentés rendent la décision déraisonnable.
Observations écrites du défendeur
[20]
Le défendeur soutient que la norme de contrôle applicable est la raisonnabilité et que la décision était raisonnable.
[21]
Le défendeur affirme qu'il incombe aux demandeurs de réfuter la présomption de la protection de l'État et que le critère applicable est le caractère adéquat, et non pas l'efficacité (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En l'espèce, les éléments de preuve relatifs aux interventions de la Pologne concernent les actes perpétrés contre les minorités sont mitigés et ne réfutaient pas la présomption de protection de l'État. En ce qui concerne l'affirmation des demandeurs voulant que la Commission n'ait pas tenu compte d'éléments de preuve, les défendeurs soulignent qu'ils n'ont pas donné d'exemples de quelques contradictions que ce soit entre les conclusions de la Commission et les éléments de preuve documentaires. Il n'y a donc pas d'erreur susceptible de contrôle.
Analyse et décision
Question en litige 1
Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
[22]
Lorsque la jurisprudence a déjà arrêté la norme de contrôle devant s'appliquer à une question, la cour de révision peut adopter cette norme (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
[23]
Les parties prétendent que la norme de contrôle applicable à l'ensemble des questions est la raisonnabilité, mais je ne suis pas d'accord avec elles. Le juge en chef Paul Crampton a récemment expliqué la norme de contrôle applicable aux décisions relatives à la persécution et à la protection de l'État dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 22, [2013] ACF no 1099 (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Essentiellement, étant donné que la jurisprudence a mis au point des critères clairs pour les deux éléments, une commission ne peut pas y déroger. Par conséquent, lorsque les demandeurs allèguent qu'une commission a mal compris le critère, la norme applicable est celle de la décision correcte, et aucune retenue ne s'impose à l'égard de la compréhension par la Commission des critères qui s'appliquent. Toutefois, lorsque les demandeurs contestent la façon dont les critères ont été appliqués à l'égard des faits, il s'agit de questions mixtes de droit et de fait, et la norme applicable est celle de la raisonnabilité ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 20 à 22;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] ACF no 1082 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4e) 413 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). En l'espèce, les demandeurs allèguent que la Commission a commis les deux types d'erreurs, de sorte que j'examinerai le premier type en fonction de la norme de la décision correcte et le dernier, en fonction de la raisonnabilité.
[24]
En appliquant la norme de la raisonnabilité, je n'interviendrai pas si la décision de la Commission est transparente, justifiée, intelligible et s'il appartient aux issues possibles acceptables (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47; et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 59). Comme la Cour suprême l'a soutenu dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 59 et 61, un tribunal examinant le caractère raisonnable d'une décision ne peut pas substituer l'issue qui serait à son avis préférable, ni réévaluer les éléments de preuve.
Question en litige 2
La Commission a-t-elle mal compris les critères applicables à la persécution et à la protection de l'État?
[25]
Le premier argument des demandeurs veut que la Commission a omis d'examiner le bien-fondé des craintes des demandeurs puisqu'elle n'a pas évalué la question de savoir si les actes discriminatoires cumulatifs équivalaient à de la persécution. Elle a plutôt uniquement évalué la protection de l'État et déterminé que la crainte n'était pas fondée étant donné qu'une protection de l'État est offerte.
[26]
La Commission n'a commis aucune erreur à ce sujet. Dans
Canada (Procureur général) c Ward
, [1993] 2 RCS 689, à 712, la Cour suprême du Canada a affirmé que « si un État est capable de protéger le demandeur, alors, objectivement, ce dernier ne craint pas avec raison d'être persécuté ». Dans la même veine, dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour d'appel fédérale a affirmé la même chose au paragraphe 42:
Pour établir si la crainte d'être persécuté qu'éprouve un demandeur d'asile est fondée objectivement, la première étape de l'analyse consiste à évaluer si le demandeur peut être protégé de la persécution alléguée par son État d'origine. [...] Quand l'État offre une protection suffisante, le demandeur ne peut pas prouver que sa crainte d'être persécuté est fondée objectivement et, par conséquent, il ne peut pas se voir accorder l'asile. Ce n'est qu'en l'absence de protection étatique que la cour doit passer à la seconde étape, où elle examine si la conduite que le demandeur assimile à de la persécution peut fournir un fondement objectif à une crainte de persécution.
[27]
La Commission a par conséquent eu raison d'aborder la question comme elle l'a fait. Comme elle avait jugé que la protection était suffisante, il n'était pas nécessaire de poursuivre l'évaluation pour voir si les actes cumulatifs de discrimination équivalaient à de la persécution étant donné qu'une telle conclusion n'aurait pas changé le résultat.
Critère de la protection de l'État
[28]
En ce qui concerne le critère de la protection de l'État, la Commission a affirmé ce qui suit dans sa décision:
[6] Puisqu'il y a lieu de présumer que les États sont en mesure de protéger leurs citoyens, la question importante que je dois trancher est de savoir s'il existe des éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants démontrant que les autorités polonaises ne pourraient pas, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, déployer de sérieux efforts pour protéger les demandeurs d'asile s'ils devaient retourner en Pologne maintenant. Il était loisible aux demandeurs d'asile de réfuter la présomption de protection de l'État en présentant des éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants démontrant qu'une protection suffisante ne pourrait pas leur être raisonnablement assurée.
...
[8] Selon le droit en matière de protection des réfugiés, les États sont tenus uniquement d'offrir une protection adéquate, et non d'assurer une protection parfaite. En d'autres termes, ils doivent seulement déployer de sérieux efforts pour protéger leurs citoyens, mais ils n'ont pas, de fait, à offrir une protection efficace ni à en garantir une. Ainsi, en ce qui concerne la protection de l'État en l'espèce, la question est uniquement de savoir s'il est raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que les autorités polonaises déploient de sérieux efforts pour protéger les demandeurs d'asile si ceux-ci devaient retourner en Pologne, et non de savoir s'il est raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que ces autorités leur offrent une protection de fait efficace ou garantie.
...
[12] Selon le dernier United States of America (US) Department of State country report [rapport national du Département d'État des États-Unis d'Amérique, l'État de la Pologne ne tolère pas la violence ou la discrimination à l'endroit des minorités ethniques. Il y est également mentionné que la Pologne déploie de sérieux efforts, tant dans ses politiques que dans la pratique, pour lutter contre la violence et la discrimination à l'endroit des minorités ethniques, notamment:
...
[15] La Réponse à la demande d'information POL103089.EF mentionne également la même chose: même si la protection de l'État pour les minorités ethniques en Pologne n'est pas parfaite, il existe effectivement des mécanismes de protection adéquats auxquels elles ont accès.
...
[17] Ayant examiné les documents objectifs susmentionnés sur les conditions dans le pays, j'estime ne pas être convaincu, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que les autorités polonaises ne déploieraient des efforts sérieux et raisonnables pour protéger les demandeurs d'asile s'ils devaient retourner en Pologne. Par conséquent, je conclus, à la lumière de la preuve, que les demandeurs d'asile n'ont pas réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État au moyen d'éléments de preuve clairs et convaincants.
(Renvois omis)
[29]
Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , j'ai écrit::
[26] Cependant, la Commission parle souvent dans sa décision des « sérieux efforts » fournis ou à fournir par les États pour protéger leurs citoyens. Elle y invoque cette notion au moins dix fois, y compris dans sa formulation du critère applicable à la détermination de la qualité de réfugié:
Selon le droit en matière d'octroi de l'asile, l'État d'origine doit seulement offrir une protection adéquate; il n'a pas à assurer une protection parfaite. En d'autres termes, il doit seulement faire de sérieux efforts pour protéger ses citoyens et n'a pas à assurer une protection effective ou garantie dans les faits.
[27] La Commission a tort de dire « [e]n d'autres termes » dans ce passage: la « protection adéquate » et les « sérieux efforts pour protéger [les] citoyens » sont deux choses différentes. L'une concerne la question de savoir si la protection est effectivement assurée dans un pays donné, tandis que les autres ne nous renseignent que sur celle de savoir si l'État a pris des mesures afin de garantir cette protection.
[28] C'est une maigre consolation pour la personne qui craint d'être persécutée que son État ait fait des efforts pour la protéger si ceux-ci ne sont pas ou guère suivis d'effet. C'est pourquoi la Commission doit évaluer dans sa réalité empirique le caractère adéquat de la protection de l'État.
[29] Notre Cour a avalisé à maintes reprises cette interprétation du critère de la protection de l'État. Monsieur le juge Roger Hughes, par exemple, s'est exprimé sans ambiguïté à ce propos au paragraphe 8 de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 1589:
Une autre erreur de droit a trait à la nature de la protection de l'État. En l'espèce, le commissaire a conclu que le Mexique « fait de sérieux efforts » pour résoudre le problème. Ce n'est pas là le critère. Ce qui doit être pris en compte est l'efficacité réelle de la protection.
[30] Monsieur le juge Michel Beaudry a formulé le même principe au paragraphe 10 de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 153:
D'abord, [la Commission] a apprécié la preuve concernant les critiques de l'efficacité de la loi au regard de la preuve concernant les mesures prises pour traiter les problèmes de violence conjugale. Cela ne suffit pas à justifier une conclusion d'existence de la protection de l'État; on doit tenir compte de la situation réelle et non de ce que l'État se propose de faire ou a entrepris de mettre en place (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 215, au paragraphe 14).
[31] Enfin, Madame la juge Catherine Kane a réitéré ce principe au paragraphe 44 de la toute récente décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Le critère n'est pas une protection de l'État « parfaite », mais adéquate. Là encore, la simple volonté de protéger ne suffit pas; la protection de l'État doit présenter un certain niveau d'efficacité:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 243, au paragraphe 47.
[32] Donc, la Commission a de toute évidence mal défini le critère juridique applicable. ...
[30]
En l'espèce, le commissaire a renvoyé à la « protection suffisante » et « de sérieux efforts, tant dans ses politiques que dans la pratique ». Cependant, au paragraphe 17 de la décision, la Commission applique clairement le critère des « efforts sérieux » et, à mon avis, le paragraphe 17 contient la conclusion essentielle de la décision. De plus, au paragraphe 8 de la décision, la Commission adopte également le critère des « efforts sérieux ». Selon ces affirmations, j'estime que la Commission a appliqué le mauvais critère en ce qui concerne sa conclusion sur la protection de l'État.
[31]
Par conséquent, il est fait droit à la demande de contrôle judiciaire, et l'affaire est renvoyée à un tribunal différemment constitué pour qu'il rende une nouvelle décision.
[32]
À cause de ma conclusion en l'espèce, je n'examinerai pas la question en litige résiduelle.
[33]
Aucune partie n'a souhaité soumettre une question grave de portée générale à certifier.
[34]
Le défendeur, avec le consentement des demandeurs, a demandé que Klaudiusz Dawidowicz, Kornela Klaudia Kowalska, Juliano Gabriel Kowalski (alias Julianno Gabrie Kowalski) et Chanel Irena Kowalsk (alias Chanel Irena Kowalska) ne figurent plus parmi les demandeurs. J'accède à cette demande.

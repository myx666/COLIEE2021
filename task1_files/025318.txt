September 23, 2013.
Counsel:

Law Offices of Roger Rowe, Toronto, Ontario, for the applicants;
William F. Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.
Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Gleason, J.
: The applicants are all citizens of Hungary of Roma ethnicity. The adult applicant, Istvanne Rezmuves, is the mother and the other two applicants are her children. They made claims for refugee protection based on discrimination and victimization they alleged they had encountered and would in future encounter in Hungary by reason of their ethnicity.
[2]
Their claims for refugee protection were joined for hearing before the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [the RPD] with the claim of Ms. Rezmuves' now-estranged spouse. At the commencement of the hearing, counsel who then acted for the applicants requested disjoinder of the applicants' applications from that of Mr. Resmuves due to a conflict of interest which had developed between the spouses. The RPD panel member who heard the case, Edward C. Robinson [the Member], refused the motion and the case proceeded. Counsel chose to remain on the record for the applicants, and Mr. Resmuves proceeded without counsel.
[3]
In a decision dated June 13, 2012, the Member rejected the applicants' and Mr. Resmuves' applications and found that Ms. Resmuves' claim to have been harassed, assaulted and raped by members of the Hungarian Guard was not credible. The Member premised this credibility determination in large part on the fact that Mr. Resmuves did not believe that the rape had occurred.
[4]
The applicants argue that the Member's decision should be set aside because, among other things, he erred in refusing the motion for disjoinder, thereby violating their rights to procedural fairness, and committed a reviewable error in finding Ms. Rezmuves' claim to lack credibility. The applicants assert that the Member's treatment of Ms. Rezmuves' evidence violates the principles enshrined in IRB Guideline 4:
Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution
, Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to section 65(3) of the
Immigration Act
, effective date: November 13, 1996 [the Gender Guidelines] and that his credibility findings are perverse because the fact that a spouse - and most especially an estranged one - does not believe that his wife has been raped provides no basis for rejecting the wife's testimony.
[5]
I agree with the applicant that the refusal to disjoin the cases resulted in a violation of the applicants' procedural fairness rights and that the Member's credibility finding was perverse. I have accordingly determined that the Member's decision must be set aside, for the reasons set out below.
Standard of Review
[6]
The parties disagree as to the standard to be applied to the review of the Member's refusal to disjoin the claims; the applicants assert that the issue is one of procedural fairness to which the correctness standard applies, whereas the respondent argues that the determination involves the application by the Member of the provisions contained in the
Refugee Protection Division Rules
, SOR/2002-228 [the Rules] to the facts of the case and is therefore subject to review on the reasonableness standard. [see footnote 1] Both parties concur that the reasonableness standard of review applies to the assessment of the Member's credibility determination.
[7]
I agree that the reasonableness standard does apply to the credibility determination as has been firmly settled by the case law (see e.g.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 13 (FC) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 369 (" <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ")). However, the deferential standard, in my view, does not apply to the Board's refusal to disjoin the claims as the refusal resulted in a denial of procedural fairness and, in the circumstances of this case, the Member is not entitled to deference in respect of his ruling on the joinder issue even if it does involve application of a provision in the Rules.
[8]
The relevant provisions of the Rules provided as follows with respect to joinder and disjoinder of claims before the RPD:

b) si le fait d'accueillir la demande favoriserait l'efficacité du travail de la Section;
c) si le fait d'accueillir la demande causerait vraisemblablement une injustice.
[9]
There appears to be little authority on the issue of the standard of review applicable to a claim that the RPD erred in refusing to join or disjoin refugee claims for hearing, or, indeed, on the principles to be applied in determining whether the RPD should grant a motion for disjoinder.
[10]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Layden-Stevenson declined to rule on the standard of review issue, holding that the application in that case failed, regardless of the standard, because there was no basis in the record before her to support the claim that the applicants were relying on different factual situations. She thus found the refusal of joinder in that case to have been both reasonable and correct.
[11]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  my colleague, Justice Russell, dismissed an allegation that the Board erred in refusing a request for an adjournment and in ordering disjoinder of the wife's claim from those of the rest of her family. Justice Russell determined that the correctness standard was applicable to the review of the RPD's decision to refuse the adjournment and order disjoinder because the claim involved an alleged violation of the applicants' procedural fairness rights. He found there had been no denial of procedural fairness in that case as the wife was not a necessary witness in the husband's claim.
[12]
Apart from these two cases, the issue does not appear to have been considered in the jurisprudence.
[13]
Until recently, it has been taken as trite law that claims of violation of procedural fairness by an administrative tribunal are subject to full curial review and that it is for the court to determine whether a tribunal has violated a party's procedural fairness rights; some cases qualify this type of review as review on the correctness standard (see e.g.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] SCJ No 9 (" <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> "); and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2009] SCJ No 12).
[14]
A recent decision of the Québec Court of Appeal, however, casts doubt on this point and holds that the deferential reasonableness standard is to be applied by a court in assessing whether a tribunal has violated a party's procedural fairness rights if what is at issue is a procedural ruling that involves the tribunal's interpretation of a provision in its constituent statute or other disposition that is closely related to its mandate and function.
[15]
In
Syndicat des employés de Au dragon forgé inc. c Commission des relations de travail
, 2013 QCCA 793 [
Syndicat des employés de Au dragon forgé
], the Court of Appeal was faced with a claim by an applicant trade union that its procedural fairness rights were violated by the Québec Labour Commission in a displacement certification application because the Commissioner refused to provide the names of certain employees the Commission found had failed to pay the membership fees to a rival trade union that was seeking to displace the applicant. This information was relevant to the applicant's position as the rival union was required to file evidence of support of over 55% of employees in the unit to be eligible to displace the applicant union as the bargaining agent. The rival union filed its membership evidence with the Commission, and the applicant union provided evidence that eight employees had failed to pay the mandatory membership fee when they signed their membership cards in the rival union. During the hearing, the Commissioner advised the parties that the Commission had determined that six employees had in fact failed to pay the required dues to join the rival union and that their cards would therefore be discounted. The applicant union requested disclosure of which cards were being rejected, but the Commissioner refused to provide the names, relying on section 36 of the
Québec Labour Code
,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  union] shall not be revealed by anyone during the certification or decertification proceedings, except to the Commission [...] and every [...] person who becomes aware of the fact that the person belongs to [a union] is bound to secrecy".
[16]
The Québec Superior Court set aside the decision of the Labour Commissioner, finding that the Commissioner had violated the
audi alteram partem
rule in refusing to disclose the requested employee names to the applicant union. On appeal, this decision was overturned, and Justice Bich, writing for the Court, held that the reasonableness standard of review was applicable to the assessment of the claimed violation of the
audi alteram partem
rule. She wrote in this regard at para 47:
"Considering all this, I am of the view that the reasonableness standard must also apply to questions of natural justice in the context of the interpretation by an administrative tribunal of its constituent statute and also to the provisions which the tribunal must interpret and apply, as is the case here. Clearly it is unnecessary to state that an interpretation which is counter to a clear legislative provision would be unreasonable." [unofficial translation]
[17]
In result, the Court of Appeal restored the decision of the Labour Commissioner, finding the refusal to disclose the names of the employees whose cards were discarded was reasonable. Subsequent jurisprudence from the Province of Québec has also applied the reasonableness standard to assessment of claims of violation of procedural fairness that are tied to a tribunal's procedural rulings made under the legislation or regulations that apply to the tribunal (see e.g.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[18]
In my view, the decision of the Québec Court of Appeal in
Syndicat des employés de Au dragon forgé
does not require that the reasonableness standard be applied to assess the claimed violation of procedural fairness made by the Member in this case. In the first place, the decision does not constitute binding authority for this Court, whereas the decisions from the Supreme Court of Canada, indicating that the correctness standard applies to claimed violations of procedural fairness, are binding on me. Secondly, and more fundamentally, there is an important distinction between the legislative provision considered in
Syndicat des employés de Au dragon forgé
and the provisions of the Rules that the Member applied in the present case.
[19]
In this regard, the Québec
Labour Code
circumscribes the scope of permissible disclosure of otherwise relevant information and thus limits parties' procedural fairness rights in respect of such information. It is well-settled that common law procedural fairness rights may be limited by statute (so long as there is no violation of a party's constitutional rights under the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,
Part I of the
Constitution Act, 1982,
being Schedule B to the
Canada Act 1982
(UK), 1982, c 11) (see e.g.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). And, as Justice Bich notes, a decision made in violation of a clear legislative provision is unreasonable.
Syndicat des employés de Au dragon forgé
can therefore be read as a case where the content of parties' procedural fairness rights were fixed by statute and the tribunal's interpretation of that statute was subject to reasonableness review, as is normally the case when a tribunal interprets a provision in its constituent statute ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 54;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[20]
Sections 49 and 50 of the Rules, on the other hand, do not in any way define the scope of the procedural fairness rights that a party before the RPD enjoys at common law. Rather, paragraph 50(c) of the Rules merely requires the RPD to determine whether providing for joinder or disjoinder would "likely cause an injustice", which does not circumscribe the rights a party would otherwise enjoy to procedural fairness as such rights exist to prevent injustice.
[21]
Thus, in my view, the Member is not entitled to deference in respect of his decision to refuse the motion for disjoinder. The question for determination by me is therefore whether in refusing the motion the Member violated the applicants' procedural fairness rights and not whether he behaved reasonably.
Was there a denial of procedural fairness?
[22]
As noted, counsel who first represented the applicants was acting for both the applicants and Mr. Rezmuves when she initially appeared before the RPD. At the outset of the hearing, she renewed a request she had previously made in writing for disjoinder of the cases and told the Member that a conflict of interest had developed between her respective clients such that she could not continue to act for all of them. The Member asked her to provide details of what the conflict of interest involved and counsel indicated that she could not do so without violating solicitor-client privilege. The Member then refused the request for disjoinder, stating that he needed more information or, as he put it, more "meat", in respect of the request, but as it was not forthcoming, the request would be refused. He further ruled that the case would nonetheless proceed that day and gave counsel the option of selecting which client she wished to represent. Counsel decided she would continue to act for Ms. Resmuves and the children (for whom Ms. Resmuves was designated as representative as they were minors).
[23]
The Personal Information Form that Ms. Resmuves filed as well as her testimony before the Member revealed that the key incidents which led her to flee Hungary involved sexual assault and an incident of gang-rape that she alleged was committed by members of the Hungarian Guard, who operated openly in her village. Her husband relied on additional incidents of alleged persecution in support of his claim for protection.
[24]
As in the normal course, the Member conducted the hearing in an inquisitorial fashion and questioned both Ms. Resmuves and her spouse. Neither was provided the opportunity to cross-examine the other. During the course of his questioning of Mr. Resmuves, the Member asked him if he loved his family and if he believed that his wife had been raped. Mr. Resmuves replied that he did still love his family and indicated that he did not believe that his wife had been raped. The Member also questioned Ms. Resmuves as to whether her husband believed that she had been raped and she confirmed that he did not believe her.
[25]
In his decision, the Member stated as follows:
If the female claimant was specially targeted by the Hungarian Guards who are also police officers and on two prior occasions was sexually assaulted (they forced her on to a wall, tried to kiss her and touched her inappropriately, etc) by these men and as she said she 'protested' against what they were doing to her, but more importantly she told her husband about it 'and he knew it was real', but when she was actually abducted and raped by these same individuals he didn't believe her. Instead he believed they had 'a consensual relationship'. It does not make sense to me that if his wife told him the bad things these men had done to her previously, and he knew it was real but he did nothing about it, but when she is subsequently raped, he doesn't believe she is raped and claimed that she had consensual sex.
I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that the female claimant was not targeted by any Hungarian Guards who are also police officers and was raped. She, as her husband believed, had a consensual relationship with someone which brought a serious strain on their marriage. He seems to love his wife and family and wants to keep his family together. For example, when he was asked 'Do you love your family,' he replied, 'For me, my family is everything.' I believe that the claimant loves his family. But I also believe that because of the stigma associated with his wife's action and as his wife testified that she has been disowned by her family, he decided to move away from Hungary and start a new life in Canada far away from the stigma and seeing those who know about the event. When she was asked why she waited two days to tell her husband about the rape, she replied that 'I knew that our lives would be ruin by this.' When Budapest was suggested as a possible IFA to avoid the problems associated with the stigma and the people who knew about it, she said that 'We have a big family in Budapest' as well.
I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that this entire claim is based on the claimants trying to escape their past, but I find that it is not a past based on persecution but the stigma of what she did. She may have been disowned by her family but certainly not persecuted or harmed in anyway by them.
[26]
In the circumstances, the refusal of the disjoinder motion amounted to a violation of procedural fairness because Mr. and Ms. Resmuves were opposed in interest, Mr. Resmuves was questioned about his views on Ms. Resmuves' claim, Ms. Resmuves was not afforded the opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Resmuves and his views about her truthfulness were used by the Member as the primary reason to reject her claim. This is fundamentally unfair as Ms. Resmuves had no ability to test the unfavourable evidence of her estranged spouse nor to point out the rather obvious reasons why, following their separation, he might be pre-disposed against her.
[27]
In the absence of authority directly on point, an analogy may be drawn to the criminal context, where severance of the trials of co-accuseds will typically be granted if one wishes to call the other to provide exculpatory evidence (see e.g.
R v Boulet
(1987), 40 CCC (3d) 38 at 43 (Que CA);
R v Torbiak
(1978), 40 CCC (2d) 193 at para 20, [1978] OJ No 580 (Ont CA);
R v Savoury
(2005), 201 OAC 40 at paras 22-29, 200 CCC (3d) 94;
R v Chow
, 2005 SCC 24 at para 10, [2005] 1 SCR 384). In that context, severance is required to ensure a fair trial so as to afford the accused the ability to have all exculpatory evidence heard as a co-accused is not compellable due to the presumption of innocence.
[28]
Here, the Rules did not provide for the right of Ms. Resmuves to cross-examine her co-applicant ex-spouse. In this regard, the Rules contemplate that co-applicants will share a common interest in the proceeding because no provision is made for a co-applicant to cross-examine another applicant. Such a provision would be expected if co-applicants with opposing interests were anticipated because cross-examination is available under the Rules in other instances where an adverse party may testify. For example, if as opposed to being a co-applicant, Mr. Resmuves had been called as a witness, Ms. Resmuves' counsel would have been entitled to cross-examine him under Rule 57(3). Likewise, the Rules provided that counsel may question (but not cross-examine) their own clients (Rule 57(2)). However, no provision is made for cross-examination of an unrepresented co-applicant. Thus, the Rules, themselves, appear to contemplate that claims will not be joined if the co-applicants are adverse in interest.
[29]
More importantly, procedural fairness requires that the right of cross-examination be afforded to a refugee claimant when confronted with testimony that is adverse to the claimant's position. Cross-examination is fundamental to the truth seeking function of a court; in
Wigmore on Evidence
(Chadbourne Rev 1970) vol 3 at §1367 cross-examination is stated to be "beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth". In many instances, cross-examination has been found to be no less important in the administrative context (see e.g. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at 166-167 and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 62 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] likewise supports the conclusion that the applicants ought to have been afforded the right to cross-examine Mr. Resmuves. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , this Court considered the refusal of the Minister's Delegate to permit the applicant to cross-examine a witness who filed affidavit evidence that was adverse to the applicant's position. In finding that the Delegate had erred, my colleague, Justice Russell, stated at para 165:
Given the important interests at stake in the Applicant's case, including freedom from persecution and torture and the rights to life, liberty and security of the person, it is my view that both section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the common-law principles of natural justice required that he be given an opportunity to test the evidence given by Detective Fernandes [by cross examination].
Similar logic applies in this case (although section 7 of the
Charter
is not engaged).
[31]
The Member thus erred in relying on the evidence of Mr. Resmuves to deny Ms. Resmuves' claim without providing her an opportunity to test his evidence. Such cross-examination is envisaged under the Rules only if the claims had been disjoined. The Member's refusal of the disjoinder request and consequent denial of the right of the applicants to cross-examine Mr. Resmuves therefore violated the applicants' procedural fairness rights and must result in the decision's being set aside.
Were the Member's Credibility Findings Unreasonable?
[32]
While my determination on the procedural fairness issue is sufficient to dispose of this application, I feel I must address the Member's credibility findings because they are so perverse they cannot escape comment.
[33]
I start my analysis with the recognition that credibility determinations fall squarely within the core of the RPD's mandate and, accordingly, are normally provided considerable deference. As I noted at para 42 in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
... the starting point in reviewing a credibility finding is the recognition that the role of this Court is a very limited one because the tribunal had the advantage of hearing the witnesses testify, observed their demeanor and is alive to all the factual nuances and contradictions in the evidence. Moreover, in many cases, the tribunal has expertise in the subject matter at issue that the reviewing court lacks. It is therefore much better placed to make credibility findings, including those related to implausibility.
[34]
This, however, does not mean that credibility findings are immune from review. Where, as here, they are perverse, capricious or made without regard to the evidence, they will be set aside under subsection 18.1(4) of the
Federal Courts Act
, RSC 1985, c F-7.
[35]
Mr. Resmuves' evidence that he did not believe Ms. Resmuves had been raped is opinion evidence regarding her credibility. Absent additional evidence to establish some relevant basis in fact for why he did not believe her account, his evidence on this point was not probative and could not form the basis for a finding that Ms. Resmuves was not credible. Credibility assessments must be left to the trier of fact, and opinion evidence on credibility is not relevant, absent special circumstances (see e.g.
R v D(D)
, [2000] 2 SCR 275 at 287, [2000] SCJ No 44; and
R v Marquard
, [1993] 4 SCR 223 at 249, [1993] SCJ No 119). In general, evidence from a witness on the credibility of a second witness is not admissible. Justices Bryant, Lederman and Fuerst state this rule at §10.135 in their
The Law of Evidence in Canada
(3rd ed) (Markham, Ont: LexisNexis, 2009) ("
The Law of Evidence
") as follows:
Questioning which seeks to obtain the belief of one witness as to the credibility of another witness, even indirectly, is inadmissible.
[36]
Moreover, the Member's line of questioning evinces a sexist attitude that is out of place in any hearing, and most especially objectionable in a hearing before the RPD where a woman is testifying about incidents of alleged sexual assault and rape that have led her to seek protection in Canada.
[37]
The common law doctrine of recent complaint - under which a failure to report a sexual assault quickly was a factor that could be considered as undercutting a complainant's credibility - was abolished by statute in criminal matters in 1983 (
Criminal Code
, RSC 1985, c C-46 at s 275).
The Law of Evidence in Canada
notes, at §1.63, that this doctrine was "based on stereotypical myths [which] made it easy for the accused to undermine the testimony of the victim and to escape conviction". The Ontario Court of Appeal commented on the doctrine as follows in
R v WB
(2000), 49 OR (3d) 321 at paras 145 - 146, 134 OAC 1
The annulment of the law relating to recent complaint was a clear rejection by Parliament of the two assumptions underlying the common law doctrine. By repealing this judge-made rule, Parliament declared that it was wrong to suggest that complainants in sexual cases were inherently less trustworthy than complainants in other kinds of cases, and that it was wrong to assume that all victims of sexual assaults, whatever their age and whatever the circumstances of the assault, would make a timely complaint. Both assumptions reflected stereotypical notions which demeaned complainants (most of whom were female) and ignored the realities of human experience. It made no sense to suggest that all persons subjected to a traumatic event such as a sexual assault could be expected to react in the same way and make a timely complaint: R v W(R), [1992] 2 SCR 122 at 136. Indeed, that assumption is now so obviously wrongheaded that it is difficult to believe that it was ever part of the accepted wisdom of the common law.
By removing the doctrine of recent complaint, Parliament sought to eliminate a rule which treated complainants in sexual assault cases as second-class persons. In addition, Parliament sought to dispel an assumption which had a real potential to mislead the trier of fact and distort the search for the truth. The abrogation of the rule struck a blow for both equality and the truth-finding function of the criminal trial process.
[38]
The same stereotypical assumptions underlie the Member's line of questioning about what Mr. Resmuves believed and his conclusions regarding Ms. Resmuves' credibility.
[39]
Indeed, in proceeding in this fashion, the Member ignored the Gender Guidelines. They provide in relevant part that:
Women refugee claimants face special problems in demonstrating that their claims are credible and trustworthy. Some of the difficulties may arise because of cross - cultural misunderstandings. For example:
1. Women from societies where the preservation of one's virginity or marital dignity is the cultural norms may be reluctant to disclose their experiences of sexual violence in order to keep their 'shame' to themselves and not dishonour their family or community
[40]
While the Gender Guidelines are not binding on the RPD, this Court has often set aside decisions where the RPD failed to apply the principles enshrined in the Guidelines. For example, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  my colleague, Justice Mosley, reviewed another decision by Member Robinson, in which the Member had found that the applicant had undertaken an "elaborate scheme of fabrication based on exaggerations and embellishments to bolster her claim for refugee status". Justice Mosley concluded that the Member's credibility findings were made in a perverse and capricious manner:
At paragraph 18 of its decision, the Board made the following implausibility finding, impugning the applicant's credibility:
The panel also looked at the claimant's testimony that she was not allowed to have friends and even sit outside of the house because that meant to her husband that she was looking for other men to be exaggerations and embellishments. For example, this is the same man who would force her to have sex with other men while he watches. As such the panel finds that the claimant's husband was hardly the kind of person to confine the claimant because of jealousy.
This reasoning fails to appreciate the psychological dimensions of abuse and the many forms in which abuse manifests in an abuser. It wrongly assumes that someone who is jealous or controlling would not subject another to demeaning sexual acts. Forcing the applicant to perform sex acts with his friends and business associates was another way for Mr. Evans to assert control of her. Jealousy and controlling behaviour can coexist. Both are rooted in control and a lack of regard for the individual and her body. The logic of the Board on this issue demonstrates both an insensitivity to the applicant's situation and a lack of awareness to the broader issue of domestic abuse and sexual assault. As such, this finding of credibility was made in a perverse and capricious manner.
[41]
A similar conclusion pertains in this case.
[42]
Thus, for these reasons, the Member's decision must be set aside.
Certified Question
[43]
The applicants submit the following question for certification under section 74 of the IRPA:
What is the applicable standard of review for an alleged error in failing to disjoin claims before the IRB?
[44]
Paragraph 74(d) of the IRPA provides that "an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal may be made only if, in rendering judgment, the judge certifies that a serious question of general importance is involved and states the question". The case law establishes three criteria for such a question, namely, that it must transcend the interest of the parties, must concern issues of broad significance or general application and must be determinative of the appeal (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 365;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 168; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 382).
[45]
Here, the respondent opposes certification of the question as it submits that the law is settled and the appropriate standard is that of reasonableness. I, however, have found precisely the opposite and believe the issue has not been canvassed in any degree in the case law. I also believe that the issue will arise in other cases as disjoinder applications are bound to reoccur, as will applications for judicial review in respect of them. I accordingly determine that the question as posed by the applicants is appropriate for certification.
JUDGMENT
[46]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. This application for judicial review is granted and the Member's decision dated June 13, 2012 is set aside;
2. The applicants' claims shall be remitted to the RPD for re-determination by a different RPD member;
3. The following question of general importance is certified:
What is the applicable standard of review for an alleged error in failing to disjoin claims before the IRB?; and
4. There is no order as to costs.

, SOR/2012-256. The two versions are substantially similar with respect to the joinder and separation of claims.
.........................
Istvanne Rezmuves, Melissza Rezmuves (mineur) et Istvan Rezmuves (mineur), représentés par leur tutrice à l'instance  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeurs sont tous des citoyens hongrois d'origine rom. La demanderesse adulte, Istvanne Rezmuves, est la mère et les deux autres demandeurs sont ses enfants. Ils ont demandé l'asile en invoquant la discrimination et la victimation qu'ils allèguent avoir subi et subiront encore en Hongrie du fait de leur origine ethnique.
[2]
Leurs demandes d'asile avaient été jointes à l'origine en vue d'une audience devant la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (SPR) à la demande de M. Rezmuves, maintenant séparé de son épouse. Au début de l'audience, l'avocate qui agissait pour le compte des demandeurs a demandé de séparer la demande de M. Rezmuves de celle des demandeurs en raison d'un conflit d'intérêt qui s'était développé entre-temps entre les deux conjoints. Le commissaire de la CISR qui a instruit la cause, Edward C. Robinson [le commissaire], a rejeté la demande et l'instance s'est poursuivie. L'avocate a choisi de représenter les demandeurs, et M. Rezmuves a plaidé sa cause sans conseil.
[3]
Dans une décision du 13 juin 2012, le commissaire a rejeté les demandes des demandeurs et celle de M. Rezmuves et a conclu que l'allégation selon laquelle que Mme Rezmuves avait été harcelée, agressée et violée par des membres de la Garde hongroise n'était pas crédible. Le commissaire a fondé sa conclusion relative à la crédibilité en grande partie sur le fait que M. Rezmuves ne croyait pas que le viol avait eu lieu.
[4]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que la décision devrait être annulée parce que, entre autres choses, le commissaire avait commis une erreur en rejetant la requête de séparation et les a du coup privés de leur droit à l'équité procédurale et qu'il avait également commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle en concluant que la demande de Mme Rezmuves n'était pas crédible. Les demandeurs affirment que la façon dont le commissaire a traité la preuve de Mme Rezmuves contrevient aux principes énoncés dans les
Directives numéro 4 du président: Revendicatrices du statut de réfugié craignant d'être persécutées en raison de leur sexe: mise à jour
, données en application du paragraphe 65(3) de la Loi sur l'immigration et entrées en vigueur le 13 novembre 1996 (lesDirectives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe) et que ses conclusions relativement à la crédibilité étaient abusives parce que le fait qu'un époux - et surtout un ex-époux - ne croit pas que sa femme a été violée ne justifie pas de rejeter le témoignage de l'épouse.
[5]
Je conviens avec la demanderesse que le refus de séparer les demandes a privé les demandeurs de l'exercice de leur droit à l'équité procédurale et que la conclusion qu'a tirée le commissaire relativement à la crédibilité était abusive. Je conclus par conséquent que la décision du commissaire doit être annulée pour les motifs énoncés ci-après.
Norme de contrôle
[6]
Les parties ne s'entendent pas sur la norme de contrôle qui s'applique au refus du commissaire de séparer les demandes; les demandeurs affirment qu'il s'agit ici d'équité procédurale et que la norme de la décision correcte s'applique, tandis que le défendeur soutient que le commissaire a appliqué les dispositions des
Règles de la Section de la protection des réfugiés
, DORS/2002-228 [les Règles] aux faits de l'espèce et que sa décision est par conséquent assujettie au contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable [voir note 1]. Les deux parties conviennent que la conclusion tirée par le commissaire relativement à la crédibilité doit être appréciée selon la norme de la décision raisonnable.
[7]
Je conviens que la norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique à la conclusion relative à la crédibilité ainsi que l'a fermement établi la jurisprudence (voir p. ex.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] ACF no 13 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] ACF no 369 (« <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> »)). Cependant, j'estime que le refus de la Commission de séparer les demandes ne donne pas lieu à l'application d'une norme déférente étant donné que ce refus a occasionné un manquement à l'obligation d'équité procédurale et, dans les circonstances de l'espèce, il ne convient pas de faire preuve de déférence à l'égard de la décision du commissaire sur la question de la séparation des demandes même si elle est le résultat de l'application d'une disposition des Règles.
[8]
Les Règles prévoient ce qui suit en ce qui concerne la jonction et la séparation des demandes présentées à la SPR:
Jonction automatique de demandes d'asile
49. (1) La Section joint la demande d'asile du demandeur d'asile à celle de son époux ou conjoint de fait, son enfant, son père, sa mère, son frère, sa soeur, son petit-fils, sa petite-fille, son grand-père et sa grand-mère.
Jonction de demandes d'annulation ou de constat de perte d'asile
(2) La Section joint les demandes d'annulation ou les demandes de constat de perte d'asile dans le cas où les demandes d'asile des personnes protégées étaient jointes.
Demande de jonction
50. (1) Toute partie peut demander à la Section de joindre plusieurs demandes d'asile, d'annulation ou de constat de perte d'asile.
Demande de séparation
(2) Toute partie peut demander à la Section de séparer des demandes d'asile, d'annulation ou de constat de perte d'asile qui ont été jointes.
Forme et transmission de la demande
(3) La partie fait sa demande selon la règle 44, mais elle n'a pas à y joindre d'affidavit ou de déclaration solennelle. De plus, elle transmet:
a) à toute personne qui sera touchée par la décision de la Section à l'égard de la demande une copie de la demande;
b) à la Section une déclaration écrite indiquant à quel moment et de quelle façon une copie de la demande a été transmise à toute personne touchée, avec preuve de transmission à l'appui.
Délai
(4) Les documents transmis selon la présente règle doivent être reçus par leurs destinataires au plus tard vingt jours avant l'audience.
Éléments à considérer
(5) Pour statuer sur la demande, la Section prend en considération tout élément pertinent. Elle examine notamment:
a) si des questions similaires de droit ou de fait découlent des affaires;
b) si le fait d'accueillir la demande favoriserait l'efficacité du travail de la Section;
c) si le fait d'accueillir la demande causerait vraisemblablement une injustice.
Claims automatically joined
49. (1) The Division must join the claim of a claimant to a claim made by the claimant's spouse or common-law partner, child, parent, brother, sister, grandchild or grandparent.
Applications joined if claims joined
(2) Applications to Vacate Refugee Protection or Applications to Cease Refugee Protection are joined if the claims of the protected persons were joined.
Application to join
50. (1) A party may make an application to the Division to join claims, Applications to Vacate Refugee Protection or Applications to Cease Refugee Protection.

(a) provide a copy of the application to any person who will be affected by a decision of the Division on the application; and
(b) provide the Division with a written statement of how and when the copy of the application was provided to any affected person, together with proof that the party provided the copy to that person.
Time limit
(4) Documents provided under this rule must be received by their recipient no later than 20 days before the hearing.
Factors
(5) In deciding the application, the Division must consider any relevant factors, including
(a) whether the claims or Applications involve similar questions of fact or law;
(b) whether allowing the application would promote the efficient administration of the work of the Division; and
(c) whether allowing the application would likely cause an injustice.
[9]
La jurisprudence et la doctrine ne traitent que peu de la norme de contrôle applicable à une décision par laquelle la SPR aurait commis une erreur en rejetant une demande de joindre ou de séparer les demandes d'asile ni, de fait, des principes applicables pour décider si la SPR devrait accueillir une demande de jonction.
[10]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la juge Layden-Stevenson a refusé de statuer sur la question de la norme de contrôle, faisant valoir que la demande avait été rejetée parce que, indépendamment de la norme applicable, rien dans le dossier qui lui avait été présenté n'appuyait pas l'argument selon lequel les demandeurs se fondaient sur des faits différents. Elle a conclu que le refus de joindre les demandes dans cette affaire était à la fois raisonnable et correct.
[11]
Dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  mon collègue, le juge Russell, a rejeté l'argument voulant que la Commission avait fait erreur en rejetant une demande d'ajournement et en ordonnant la séparation de la demande de l'épouse de celle du reste de sa famille. Le juge Russell a décidé que la norme de la décision correcte s'appliquait au contrôle de la décision de la SPR de refuser l'ajournement et d'ordonner la séparation des demandes parce que les demandeurs alléguaient un manquement à l'équité procédurale. Il a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas été privés de leur droit à cet égard et que le témoignage de l'épouse n'était pas indispensable dans l'examen de la demande de l'époux.
[12]
Mis à part ces deux cas, le sujet ne semble pas avoir été pris en considération dans la jurisprudence.
[13]
Jusqu'à récemment, il était considéré comme un principe bien établi que les allégations de manquement à l'équité procédurale de la part d'un tribunal administratif sont sujettes à un examen judiciaire exhaustif et que c'est à la cour qu'il incombe de déterminer si le tribunal a effectivement manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale; dans certaines décisions, ce type d'examen est qualifié de contrôle selon la norme de la décision correcte (voir p. ex.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] ACS no 9 ( «
Dunsmuir »
); et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2009] ACS no 12).
[14]
Dans une récente décision, toutefois, la Cour d'appel du Québec met ce principe en doute en statuant que la cour doit appliquer la norme déférente du caractère raisonnable pour déterminer si un tribunal administratif a privé une partie de ses droits à l'équité procédurale dans le cas où la décision contestée est d'ordre procédural et a trait à l'interprétation que le tribunal a faite d'une disposition de sa loi constitutive ou de toute autre disposition qui est étroitement liée à son mandat et à son rôle.
[15]
Dans l'arrêt
Syndicat des employés de Au dragon forgé inc. c Commission des relations de travail
, 2013 QCCA 793 [
Syndicat des employés de Au dragon forgé
], la Cour d'appel a été saisie d'une affaire dans laquelle une organisation syndicale prétendait que ses droits à l'équité procédurale avaient été violés par la Commission des relations du travail, laquelle, dans le cadre d'une demande de substitution d'agent négociateur, avait refusé de fournir les noms de certains des employés qui, de l'avis de la Commission, avaient omis d'acquitter les droits d'adhésion au syndicat rival qui cherchait à prendre la place du demandeur. Cette information revêtait de l'importance pour le demandeur étant donné que le syndicat rival était tenu de produire la preuve du soutien de plus de 55 % des employés de l'unité de négociation pour avoir le droit de se substituer au demandeur. Le syndicat rival avait déposé la preuve du soutien des membres auprès de la Commission, et le demandeur avait fourni la preuve que huit de ces employés n'avaient pas acquitté les droits d'adhésion obligatoires au moment de signer leur carte de membre du syndicat rival. Au cours de l'audience, le commissaire avait informé les parties que la Commission avait conclu que six des huit employés n'avaient effectivement pas acquitté les droits requis pour adhérer au syndicat rival et que, en conséquence, leur cartes n'allaient pas être prises en compte. Le syndicat demandeur avait cherché à savoir quelles cartes allaient être rejetées, mais le commissaire a refusé de communiquer les noms en s'appuyant sur l'article 36 du
Code du travail
du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  salariés ne doit être révélée par quiconque au cours de la procédure d'accréditation ou de révocation d'accréditation sauf à la Commission [...] Ces personnes ainsi que toute autre personne qui prend connaissance de cette appartenance sont tenues au secret ».
[16]
La Cour supérieure du Québec a cassé la décision de la Commission des relations du travail et conclu que le commissaire avait contrevenu à la règle
audi alteram partem
en refusant de révéler les noms des employés en cause au syndicat demandeur. En appel, la décision a été infirmée par la juge Bich, laquelle, s'exprimant au nom de la Cour, a déclaré que la norme du caractère raisonnable s'appliquait à l'examen relatif à la violation alléguée de la règle
audi alteram partem
. À cet égard, elle écrit au paragraphe 47:
Considérant tout cela, j'estime, par analogie, que la norme de la décision raisonnable doit aussi s'appliquer lorsque la question de la justice naturelle se pose dans le contexte de l'interprétation par le tribunal administratif de sa loi constitutive et accessoirement aux dispositions qu'elle doit ainsi interpréter et appliquer, comme c'est ici le cas. Évidemment, il n'est pas nécessaire de préciser qu'une interprétation qui irait à l'encontre d'une disposition législative limpide serait déraisonnable.
[17]
Enfin, la Cour d'appel a rétabli la décision de la Commission des relations du travail, estimant raisonnable le refus d'identifier les employés dont les cartes avaient été rejetées. Dans des décisions subséquentes, la Cour du Québec a aussi appliqué la norme de la raisonnabilité à l'examen des allégations de manquement à l'équité procédurale qui se rapportent aux décisions d'ordre procédural qu'un tribunal a rendues en vertu de la législation ou des règlements qui s'appliquent à lui (voir p. ex.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[18]
À mon avis, la décision qu'a rendue la Cour d'appel du Québec dans l'affaire
Syndicat des employés de Au dragon forgé
ne nous oblige pas à appliquer la norme de la raisonnabilité à l'examen relatif au manquement à l'équité procédurale qu'aurait commis le commisssaire en l'espèce. Tout d'abord, cette décision ne lie pas la Cour, contrairement aux arrêts de la Cour suprême du Canada, selon lesquels la norme du caractère correct doit s'appliquer lorsqu'il est question de manquement à l'équité procédurale. Ensuite, et surtout, il importe de distinguer la disposition législative considérée dans l'affaire
Syndicat des employés de Au dragon forgé
et les dispositions des Règles que le commissaire a appliquées en l'espèce.
[19]
À cet égard, le
Code du travail
du Québec circonscrit la portée de la communication autorisée de renseignements par ailleurs pertinents, et restreint ainsi l'exercice des droits à l'équité procédurale des parties à l'égard de cette information. Il est bien établi que les droits à l'équité procédurale reconnus en common law peuvent être restreints par la loi (tant que ne sont pas enfreints les droits constitutionnels garantis par la
Charte
canadienne des droits et libertés
, partie 1 de la
Loi constitutionnelle de 1982
, annexe B de la
Loi constitutionnelle de 1982
(R.-U.) 1982, c 11) (voir p. ex.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Ainsi que le fait remarquer la juge Bich, toute décision contravenant à une disposition législative claire est déraisonnable. L'affaire
Syndicat des employés de Au dragon forgé
peut donc être considérée comme un cas où les droits à l'équité procédurale d'une partie étaient définis par une loi et où l'interprétation de cette loi par le tribunal était sujette à la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable, comme c'est normalement le cas lorsqu'un tribunal interprète une disposition de sa loi constitutive ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 54;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[20]
Les articles 49 et 50 des Règles, par ailleurs, ne définissent d'aucune façon la portée des droits à l'équité procédurale que peut exercer en common law une partie qui comparaît devant la SPR. En fait, l'alinéa
c
) de l'article 50 requiert seulement que la CISR détermine si la jonction ou la séparation des demandes « causerait vraisemblablement une injustice », ce qui ne circonscrit pas les droits à l'équité procédurale qu'une partie pourrait exercer puisque ces droits ont pour objet d'empêcher toute injustice.
[21]
Par conséquent, je suis d'avis qu'il n'y a pas lieu de faire preuve de déférence à l'égard de la décision de rejeter la demande de séparation. Je dois donc statuer sur la question de savoir si, en rejetant la demande, le commissaire a porté atteinte aux droits à l'équité procédurale des demandeurs, et non si sa décision était raisonnable.
Y a-t-il eu manquement à l'équité procédurale?
[22]
Comme nous l'avons fait remarquer, l'avocate qui a la première représenté les demandeurs agissait à la fois au nom des demandeurs et au nom de M. Rezmuves lorsqu'elle s'est présentée devant la SPR. Au début de l'audience, elle a renouvelé une demande de séparation des cas qu'elle avait déjà faite par écrit et a informé le commissaire qu'en raison d'un conflit d'intérêts qui avait émergé entre les époux, elle ne pouvait plus les représenter tous. Le commissaire lui a demandé des précisions sur ce conflit d'intérêts et l'avocate lui a déclaré qu'elle ne pouvait lui en donner sans violer le secret professionnel. Le commissaire a alors rejeté la demande de séparation, faisant valoir qu'il lui fallait plus de renseignements ou, à tout le moins, qu'il lui fallait connaître l'essentiel du conflit, à défaut de quoi il devrait rejetter la demande. Il a également décidé d'instruire quand même l'affaire le jour même et a donné à l'avocate la possibilité de choisir l'époux qu'elle voulait représenter. L'avocate a décidé de continuer d'agir au nom de Mme Rezmuves et de ses enfants (desquels Mme Rezmuves a été nommée tutrice en raison de leur statut de mineurs).
[23]
Le formulaire de renseignements personnels déposé par Mme Rezmuves ainsi que son témoignage devant le commissaire ont mis au jour le fait qu'elle s'était enfuie de la Hongrie parce qu'elle avait été victime d'agression sexuelle et de viol collectif aux mains de membres de la Garde hongroise qui se livraient sans gêne à ces activités dans son village. Son époux a allégué quant à lui d'autres actes de persécution pour appuyer sa demande d'asile.
[24]
Comme c'est la coutume, le commissaire a mené l'audience de façon inquisitoire et a interrogé aussi bien Mme Rezmuses que son époux. Aucun n'a eu la possibilité de contre-interroger l'autre. Durant l'interrogatoire de M. Rezmuves, le commissaire lui a demandé s'il aimait sa famille et s'il croyait que sa femme avait été violée. M. Rezmuves a répondu qu'il aimait toujours sa famille, mais qu'il ne croyait pas que sa femme avait été violée. Le commissaire a également demandé à Mme Rezmuves si son mari croyait qu'elle avait été violée et elle a confirmé qu'il ne la croyait pas.
[25]
Dans sa décision, le commissaire a déclaré ce qui suit.
Si la demandeure d'asile a bien été ciblée expressément par des membres de la Garde hongroise, qui sont aussi des policiers, et qu'elle a été agressée sexuellement deux fois auparavant (ils l'ont poussée de force contre un mur, ont essayé de l'embrasser et l'ont touchée de façon inappropriée, etc.) par ces hommes et, comme elle l'a affirmé, qu'elle a protesté contre ce qu'ils lui faisaient subir, mais surtout, qu'elle l'a dit à son époux et que celui-ci a su que ces incidents avaient réellement eu lieu, il n'en reste pas moins que, lorsque la demandeure d'asile a en fait été enlevée et violée par ces mêmes individus, son époux ne l'a pas cru. Il a plutôt pensé qu'elle avait eu « une relation consensuelle ». Il ne me semble pas logique que l'épouse du demandeur d'asile lui ait parlé des choses graves que ces hommes lui avaient fait subir auparavant, que celui-ci ait su que ces incidents avaient réellement eu lieu et qu'il n'avait rien fait, mais que, lorsqu'elle avait été violée par la suite, le demandeur d'asile n'ait pas cru qu'elle avait été violée et ait dit qu'elle avait eu une relation sexuelle consensuelle.
Par conséquent, je conclus, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que la demandeure d'asile n'a pas été ciblée ni violée par des membres de la Garde hongroise, qui sont aussi policiers. Son époux croyait qu'elle avait eu une relation consensuelle avec quelqu'un, ce qui a mis leur mariage à rude épreuve. Il semble aimer son épouse et sa famille et veut que celle-ci demeure unie. Par exemple, lorsqu'il lui a été demandé [traduction] « Aimez-vous votre famille? », le demandeur d'asile a répondu ce qui suit: [traduction] « Ma famille est tout pour moi. » Je crois que le demandeur d'asile aime sa famille, mais je pense aussi que, en raison de la stigmatisation associée aux gestes de son épouse et de l'affirmation de celle-ci selon laquelle sa famille l'avait reniée, le demandeur d'asile a décidé de quitter la Hongrie et de commencer une nouvelle vie au Canada loin de la stigmatisation et des personnes qui étaient au courant de l'événement. Lorsqu'il lui a été demandé pourquoi elle avait attendu deux jours avant de parler du viol à son époux, la demandeure d'asile a répondu ceci: [traduction] « Je savais que nos vies en seraient ruinées. » Lorsque la ville de Budapest a été proposée comme possibilité de refuge intérieur pour éviter les problèmes associés à la stigmatisation et aux personnes qui étaient au courant de ce qui s'était passé, la demandeure d'asile a déclaré que son époux et elle avaient une grande famille à Budapest également.
Par conséquent, je conclus, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que toute cette demande d'asile repose sur le fait que les demandeurs d'asile tentent d'échapper à leur passé, mais j'estime qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un passé fondé sur la persécution, mais plutôt sur la stigmatisation découlant du comportement de la demandeure d'asile. Les membres de sa famille l'ont peut-être reniée, mais ne l'ont certainement pas persécutée ni blessée d'aucune façon.
[26]
Dans ces circonstances, le refus d'autoriser la séparation des demandes équivalait à un manquement à l'équité procédurale parce que les intérêts de M. et de Mme Rezmuves étaient opposés; on a demandé à M. Rezmuves de donner son avis sur l'allégation de Mme Rezmuves, mais Mme Rezmuves n'a pas eu la possibilité de contre-interroger M. Rezmuves et le commissaire s'est essentiellement fondé sur l'opinion qu'avait M. Rezmuves sur la sincérité de Mme Rezmuves pour rejeter sa demande. Cette décision est fondamentalement injuste étant donné que Mme Rezmuves n'a pas pu contester la preuve défavorable de son ex-époux ni signaler les raisons évidentes pour lesquelles, à la suite de leur séparation, il serait moins bien disposé à son égard.
[27]
À défaut de doctrine ou de jurisprudence sur la question, on peut faire une analogie avec la justice pénale, où la séparation des procès de co-accusés est généralement autorisée si l'un des accusés souhaite faire témoigner l'autre pour obtenir une preuve disculpatoire (voir p. ex.
R c Boulet
(1987), 40 CCC (3rd) 38, à la p. 43 (QC CA);
R c Torbiak
(1978), 40 CCC (2d) 193, au paragraphe 20, [1978] OJ no 580 (ON CA);
R c Savoury
(2005), 201 OAC 40, aux paragraphes 22 à 29, 200 CCC (3rd) 94;
R c Chow
, 2005 CSC 24, au paragraphe 10, [2005] 1 RCS 384). Dans ce contexte, la séparation est requise pour garantir un procès équitable et donner à l'accusé la possibilité de faire entendre toute la preuve disculpatoire étant donné qu'un co-accusé n'est pas contraint de témoigner en raison de la présomption d'innocence.
[28]
En l'espèce, les Règles ne donnent pas à Mme Rezmuves le droit de contre-interroger son ex-époux co-demandeur. Les Règles reposent sur la prémisse que les co-demandeurs ont un intérêt commun dans une instance puisque rien n'autorise un co-demandeur à contre-interroger l'autre demandeur. Cela serait possible dans le cas où des co-demandeurs auraient des intérêts opposés car les Règles autorisent le contre-interrogatoire lorsqu'une partie adverse est susceptible de témoigner. Par exemple, si M. Rezmuves avait dû témoigner non pas comme co-demandeur mais comme témoin, le paragraphe 57(3) des Règles aurait permis à l'avocate de Mme Rezmuves de le contre-interroger. Par ailleurs, les Règles prévoient que le conseiller peut interroger (mais non contre-interroger ses propres clients (paragraphe 57(2)). Toutefois, rien ne prévoit le contre-interrogatoire d'un co-demandeur non représenté. En conséquence, les Règles semblent envisager la possibilité que les demandes soient séparées si les intérêts des co-demandeurs sont opposés.
[29]
Plus important encore, l'équité procédurale implique que le droit de contre-interroger doit être accordé à un demandeur d'asile dans le cas où le témoignage d'une autre partie lui est défavorable. Le contre-interrogatoire est essentiel à la fonction de recherche de la vérité des tribunaux. Dans
Wigmore on Evidence
(Chadbourne rev. 1970), vol. 3, au paragraphe 1367, le contre-interrogatoire est considéré comme le meilleur mécanisme juridique qu'on ait jamais imaginé pour mettre la vérité au jour. Dans bien des cas, le contre-interrogatoire a été jugé tout aussi important dans le contexte administratif (voir p. ex. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux pages 166 et 167, et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 62 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] appuie aussi la conclusion selon laquelle les demandeurs auraient dû pouvoir se prévaloir du droit de contre-interroger M. Rezmuves. Dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour s'est penchée sur le refus de la déléguée du ministre d'autoriser le demandeur à contre-interroger un témoin qui avait déposé par affidavit une preuve nuisible à la position du demandeur. En concluant que la déléguée du ministre avait fait erreur, mon collègue, le juge Russell, a déclaré ceci au paragraphe 165:
Vu l'importance pour le demandeur des conséquences de la décision contrôlée, qui mettait notamment en jeu son droit de ne pas être soumis à la persécution et à la torture, ainsi que ses droits à la vie, à la liberté et à la sécurité de sa personne, j'estime que l'article 7 de la
Charte canadienne des droits et libertés
aussi bien que les principes de justice naturelle inhérents à la common law exigeaient qu'on lui accorde la possibilité de mettre à l'épreuve la véracité de la déclaration du détective Fernandes produite en preuve contre lui [en contre-interrogatoire].
Le même raisonnement s'applique en l'espèce (même si l'article 7 de la Charte ne s'applique pas).
[31]
Le commissaire a donc fait erreur en se fondant sur la déclaration de M. Rezmuves pour rejeter la demande de Mme Rezmuves sans donner à celle-ci la possibilité de mettre à l'épreuve la véracité de la déclaration. Le contre-interrogatoire est autorisé par les Règles uniquement si les demandes ont été séparées. Le rejet de la demande de séparation et le déni conséquent du droit des demandeurs de contre-interroger M. Rezmuves ont privé les demandeurs de leur droit à l'équité procédurale et doivent entraîner l'annulation de la décision.
La Commission a-t-elle tiré des conclusions déraisonnables quant à la crédibilité?
[32]
Bien que ma conclusion sur la question de l'équité procédurale suffise à trancher la présente demande, je me sens tenu de revenir sur les conclusions qu'a tirées le commissaire quant à la crédibilité car leur caractère est si abusif qu'elles doivent être commentées.
[33]
Je commencerai mon analyse en reconnaissant que les décisions relatives à la crédibilité ressortissent entièrement au mandat de la SPR et, en conséquence, méritent généralement une grande déférence. Comme je l'ai fait remarquer au paragraphe 42 du jugement <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[...] il faut reconnaître, avant même de se pencher sur une conclusion relative à la crédibilité, que le rôle de la Cour est très limité, étant donné que le tribunal a eu l'occasion d'entendre les témoins, d'observer leur comportement et de relever toutes les nuances et contradictions factuelles contenues dans la preuve. Ajoutons à cela que, dans bien des cas, le tribunal possède une expertise reconnue dans le domaine qui fait défaut à la cour de révision. Le tribunal est donc bien mieux placé pour tirer des conclusions quant à la crédibilité, et notamment pour juger de la plausibilité de la preuve.
[34]
Toutefois, cela ne signifie pas que les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité sont à l'abri d'un contrôle. Lorsque, comme c'est le cas en espèce, elles sont tirées de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte de la preuve au dossier, elles doivent être annulées en vertu du paragraphe 18.1(4) de la
Loi sur les Cours fédérales
, LRC 1985, c F-7.
[35]
En déclarant qu'il ne croyait pas que Mme Rezmuves avait été violée, M. Rezmuves a fourni un témoignage d'opinion sur sa crédibilité. À défaut d'autres éléments de preuve permettant d'appuyer sur des faits les raisons pour lesquelles il ne l'a pas cru, ce témoignage n'était pas probant et ne pouvait servir de fondement à une conclusion selon laquelle Mme Rezmuves n'était pas crédible. Les appréciations de la crédibilité doivent être laissées au juge des faits et les témoignages d'opinion relativement à la crédibilité ne sont pas pertinents, sauf dans des conditions particulières (voir p.ex.
R c D(D)
, [2000] 2 RCS 275, à la page 287, [2000] ACS no 44; et
R c Marquard
, [1993] 4 RCS 223, à la page 249, [1993] ACS no 119). En règle générale, le témoignage d'un témoin sur la crédibilité d'un autre témoin n'est pas admissible. Les juges Bryant, Lederman et Fuerst établissent cette règle au paragraphe 10.135 de leur ouvrage
The Law of Evidence in Canada
(3e ed.) (Markham (Ontario), LexisNexis, 2009) («
The Law of Evidence
»):
[traduction]
Les questions qui visent à obtenir l'opinion d'un témoin sur la crédibilité d'un autre témoin, même indirectement, sont inadmissibles.
[36]
De plus, le type d'interrogatoire auquel a procédé le commissaire révèle une attitude sexiste qui n'a pas sa place dans une audience et est d'autant plus inacceptable dans une audience devant la SPR où une femme relate des agressions sexuelles et des viols qu'elle aurait subis et qui l'ont poussée à demander l'asile au Canada.
[37]
Le principe de la plainte immédiate en common law - selon lequel le défaut de rapporter une agression sexuelle rapidement est un facteur pouvant être considéré comme minant la crédibilité d'un plaignant - a été aboli par la législation pénale en 1983 (
Code criminel
, LRC 1985, c C-46, art. 275). Dans l'ouvrage
The Law of Evidence in Canada
, les auteurs font remarquer au paragraphe 1.63, que ce principe était [traduction] « fondé sur des stéréothypes qui permettaient a l'accusé de saper le témoignage de la victime et d'échapper à la condamnation ». La Cour d'appel de l'Ontario a fait les observations suivantes à ce sujet
R c WB
(2000), 49 OR (3rd) 321, aux paragraphes 145 et 146, 134 OAC 1:
[traduction]
L'abrogation du principe de droit de la plainte immédiate a signifié le rejet clair par le législateur des deux fondements de ce principe de common law. En révoquant cette règle conçue par un juge, le législateur a déclaré qu'il était injuste de laisser entendre que les plaignants dans des affaires d'agressions sexuelles étaient moins crédibles que les plaignants dans d'autres types d'affaires, et qu'il était injuste de présumer que toutes les victimes d'agressions sexuelles, peu importe leur âge et les circonstances de l'agression, présentent une plainte sans attendre. Les deux suppositions véhiculaient des stéréotypes qui rabaissaient les plaignants (dont la plupart étaient de sexe féminin) et ne tenaient pas compte des réalités de l'existence. Il était insensé de laisser entendre qu'il fallait présumer des victimes d'un crime traumatisant comme l'agression sexuelle qu'elles réagissent toutes de la même façon et qu'elles fassent une plainte spontanée (
R c W (R)
, [1992] 2 RCS 122, à la page 136. De fait, cette supposition est aujourd'hui si erronée qu'il est difficile de s'imaginer qu'elle a déjà été reconnue dans la common law.
En révoquant la règle de la plainte spontanée, le législateur a voulu éliminer une règle qui traitait les plaignants d'agressions sexuelles comme des citoyens de seconde classe. De plus, le Parlement a également voulu écarter une présomption qui risquait vraiment d'induire le juge des faits en erreur et de dénaturer la quête de la vérité. L'abrogation de la règle a été très favorable aussi bien à l'égalité qu'à la quête de la vérité à laquelle les tribunaux sont tenus.
[38]
Les mêmes stéréotypes sous-tendent les questions que le commissaire a posées à M. Rezmuves au sujet de son opinion sur Mme Rezmuves et des conclusions qu'il a tirées quant à la crédibilité de cette dernière.
[39]
De fait, en procédant de cette façon, le commissaire n'a pas fait cas des Directives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe, lesquelles disposent de ce qui suit:
Les femmes qui revendiquent le statut de réfugié font face à des problèmes particuliers lorsque vient le moment de démontrer que leur revendication est crédible et digne de foi. Certaines difficultés peuvent survenir à cause des différences culturelles. Ainsi,
1. Les femmes provenant de sociétés où la préservation de la virginité ou la dignité de l'épouse constitue la norme culturelle peuvent être réticentes à parler de la violence sexuelle dont elles ont été victimes afin de garder leur sentiment de « honte » pour elles-mêmes et de ne pas déshonorer leur famille ou leur collectivité.
[40]
Si les Directives concernant la persécution fondée sur le sexe ne lient pas la SPR, la Cour a souvent annulé des décisions où la SPR a omis d'appliquer les principes qui sont énoncés dans les Directives. Par exemple, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  mon collègue, le juge Mosley, a contrôlé une autre decision du commissaire Robinson selon lequel la demanderesse usait « d'un stratagème complexe de fabrications fondées sur des exagérations et sur une version embellie de son histoire pour étayer sa demande d'asile ». Le juge Mosley a conclu que les conclusions du commissaire quant à la crédibilité de la demanderesse avaient été tirées de manière abusive et arbitraire.
Au paragraphe 18 de sa décision, la Commission a émis la conclusion quant à la vraisemblance suivante, portant atteinte à la crédibilité de la demanderesse:
Le tribunal a également considéré que le témoignage de la demandeure d'asile, selon lequel il lui était interdit d'avoir des amis, voire de s'asseoir à l'extérieur de la maison, parce que ces gestes signifieraient pour son époux qu'elle cherchait d'autres hommes, était constitué d'exagérations et d'embellissements. Par exemple, il s'agit du même homme qui aurait forcé la demanderesse d'asile à avoir des relations sexuelles avec d'autres hommes alors qu'il regardait. Le tribunal estime donc que l'époux de la demanderesse d'asile pouvait difficilement être le genre d'homme à enfermer son épouse parce qu'il était jaloux.
Les aspects psychologiques de l'agression ainsi que les diverses formes sous lesquelles les agressions et sévices peuvent se présenter chez l'agresseur ne sont pas reconnus dans ce raisonnement. Ce raisonnement considère, à tort, qu'une personne jalouse ou qui brime son conjoint ne peut forcer une personne à se soumettre à des activités sexuelles dégradantes. M. Evans soumettait sa conjointe à des activités sexuelles avec ses amis et collègues de travail et cela constituait pour lui un autre moyen d'assurer sa dominance sur sa conjointe. La jalousie et la domination peuvent coexister. Les deux attitudes découlent de la volonté d'exercer son pouvoir sur une autre personne et du manque de respect envers l'autre personne et son corps. La logique de la Commission sur ce point démontre tant une insensibilité envers la situation de la demanderesse qu'un manque de vigilance quant à l'ensemble de la problématique de la violence conjugale et de l'agression sexuelle. À la lumière de ces éléments, la Cour estime que la présente conclusion au sujet de la crédibilité fut tirée de manière abusive et arbitraire.
[41]
Nous appliquons le même jugemenrt en l'espèce.
[42]
Par conséquent, pour ces motifs, la décision du commissaire doit être annulée.
Question certifiée
[43]
Les demandeurs demandent de certifier la question suivante en application de l'article 74 de la LIPR:
Quelle norme de contrôle s'applique lorsque l'erreur alléguée consiste à avoir omis de séparer les demandes devant la SPR?
[44]
L'alinéa 74
d
) de la LIPR dispose que « le jugement consécutif au contrôle judiciaire n'est susceptible d'appel en Cour d'appel fédérale que si le juge certifie que l'affaire soulève une question grave de portée générale et énonce celle-ci ». La jurisprudence a établi trois critères à cet égard, à savoir que la question doit transcender les intérêts des parties, qu'elle doit être de portée ou d'importance générale et qu'elle doit déterminante de l'issue de l'appel (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 365;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 168; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 10, 446 NR 382).
[45]
En l'espèce, le défendeur s'oppose à la certification de la question, soutenant que la loi est bien établie et que la norme de contrôle applicable est celle du caractère raisonnable. Toutefois, je pense exactement le contraire et estime que la question n'a pas été vraiment débattue dans la jurisprudence. J'estime également que cette question sera soulevée à nouveau dans l'avenir car d'autres demandes de séparation se présenteront certainement, tout comme les demandes de contrôle judiciaire des décisions rendues à leur égard. Je conclus par conséquent que la question posée par les demandeurs doit être certifiée.
JUGEMENT
[46]
LA COUR STATUE que
:
1. La présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie et la décision du commissaire datée du 13 juin 2012 est annulée.
2. Les demandes d'asile sont renvoyées à la SPR pour être examinées par un tribunal différemment constitué.
3. La question d'importance générale suivante est certifiée:
Quelle norme de contrôle s'applique lorsque l'erreur alléguée consiste à avoir omis de séparer les demandes devant la SPR?
4. Aucuns dépens ne sont adjugés.
Notes
1. La version DORS/2002-228 des
Règles
de la Section de la protection des réfugiés
était en vigueur à l'époque de la décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle. Elle a été remplacée le 15 décembre 2012 par la version DORS/2012-256). L'une comme l'autre version sont essentiellement identiques en ce qui a trait à la jonction et à la séparation des demandes

 Introduction 
 
 
 
 [1] 
   
 Tremblay-Lamer, J. 
  [Translation]: This is an application for judicial review of a "Requirement to Pay" (administrative seizure) issued by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (respondent) on January 25, 2006, to the National Bank of Canada requiring it to remit the sum of $58,200.75, property of Jus d'Or Inc. (applicant), to the Receiver General on account of the liability of the tax debtor, Jus d'Or Inc. 
 
 
 
 Facts 
 
 
 
 [2] 
  The applicant operates a restaurant, hotel and bar business. The payroll management for its staff is contracted out to third parties, 9145-5287 Québec Inc, 9079-1526 Québec Inc. and 6369910 Canada Inc. 
 
 
 
 [3] 
  The respondent sought to determine whether the amounts deducted from the wages of the applicant's employees under the  
 Income Tax  
 Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th supp.) (the  
 ITA 
 ) and the  
 Employment Insurance  
 Act 
 , R.S.C. 1996, c. 23 (the  
 EIA 
 ) had been remitted. Having failed to obtain the relevant documents from the applicant and the third-party companies, the respondent issued a first notice of assessment against the applicant on January 17, 2006, in the amount of $58,100.39. This figure represented the source deductions from the wages of the applicant's employees for the period from April 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. 
 
 
 
 [4] 
  The amount claimed was payable immediately. In fact, on January 26, 2006, the respondent sent an administrative seizure to the National Bank of Canada for $58,200.75, naming the applicant as the tax debtor. This amount was remitted to the respondent the following day. 
 
 
 
 [5] 
  On March 6, 2006, the applicant sent the respondent a notice of objection to the notice of assessment issued on January 17, 2006, under the  
 ITA 
 . 
 
 
 
 [6] 
  On March 10, 2006, after the respondent had obtained more information about the source deductions from the wages of the applicant's employees, a new notice of assessment was issued against the applicant requiring payment of $96,275.28. 
 
 
 
 Issues 
 
 
 
 (1) Did Canada Customs and Revenue Agency err in assessing the applicant? 
 
 
 
 (2) Did the administrative seizure comply with the time limits in subsection 225.1 of the  
 ITA 
 ? 
 
 
 
 (3) Did the second notice of assessment nullify the administrative seizure that had been sent to the National Bank of Canada? 
 
 
 
 Analysis 
 
 
 
 (1) Did Canada Customs and Revenue Agency err in assessing the applicant? 
 
 
 
 [7] 
  According to the applicant, two distinct legal entities were responsible for hiring, dismissing and paying the employees who worked in the applicant's businesses. The applicant therefore maintains that, under the principles developed in  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the respondent erred in assessing Jus d'Or Inc. for non-payment of the source deductions. According to this decision, where a third party is responsible for paying employees' wages, the same company should be responsible for statutory deductions. However, this Superior Court decision does not apply here at all because this is an application for judicial review to the Federal Court of a notice of assessment issued under the  
 ITA 
  and the  
 EIA 
 , not a notice of assessment issued by the Minister of Revenue of Quebec under the  
 Ministry of Revenue  
 Act 
 . 
 
 
 
 [8] 
  It should be noted that the jurisdiction of this Court is much narrower than that of the Québec Superior Court. In fact, the jurisprudence of this Court is clear: the  
 Federal Court has no jurisdiction on a judicial review to vacate or review tax assessments 
  ( 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED). In  
 FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 [9] 
  More recently, Mr. Justice O'Keefe statedFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 
 In view of this jurisprudence, it is clear that the Court cannot grant the relief requested on an application for judicial review. 
 
 
 
 [10] 
  The legislation establishes the procedure that must be followed by anyone who objects to a notice of assessment issued under the  
 ITA 
  or the  
 EIA 
 . The procedure is set out in sections 165 and following of the  
 ITA 
  and in sections 92 and 103 of the  
 EIA 
 . These provisions provide that an objection to a notice of assessment must be served on the Minister and that it may be appealed to the Tax Court of Canada and from there to the Federal Court of Appeal. Accordingly, to allow this Court on an application for judicial review to vacate or review a notice of assessment would create a duplicity of proceedings, which is not acceptable under section 18.5 of the  
 Federal Courts  
 Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7. 
 
 
 
 (2) Did the administrative seizure comply with the time limits in subsection 225.1 of the  
 ITA 
 ? 
 
 
 
 [11] 
  The purpose of the administrative seizure of January 26, 2006, was to recover the amounts that had been deducted from the wages of the applicant's employees from April 1, 2005, to December 31, 2005, pursuant to the  
 ITA 
  and the  
 EIA 
 . 
 
 
 
 [12] 
  The collection of amounts due on account of tax is suspended during the time periods specified in subsections 225.1(1) to (5) of the  
 ITA 
 . The exceptions to this suspension are set out in subsection 225.1(6) of the  
 ITA 
 . The relevant provisions can be found in the Appendix. 
 
 
 
 [13] 
  As indicated in this provision, particularly subsection 225.1(6) of the  
 ITA 
 , collection activity is not suspended for "an amount required to be deducted or withheld, and required to be remitted or paid." That said, subsection 153(1) of the  
 ITA 
  specifies that deductions from an employee's wages are "amount[s] required to be deducted or withheld, and required to be remitted or paid." 
 
 
 
 [14] 
  Consequently, the respondent was entitled to proceed by way of administrative seizure on January 26, 2006, to recover the amounts deducted for tax from the wages of the applicant's employees. I also accept that there is no restriction on the collection of amounts deducted from employees' wages under the  
 EIA 
 . 
 
 
 
 [15] 
  In short, there was no restriction on the applicant in collecting amounts due under the  
 ITA 
  or the  
 EIA 
 . 
 
 
 
 (3) Did the second notice of assessment nullify the administrative seizure that had been sent to the National Bank of Canada? 
 
 
 
 [16] 
  A first notice of assessment was issued against the applicant on January 17, 2006, in the amount of $58,100.39 to recover the amounts deducted from the wages of the applicant's employees from April 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. On January 25, 2006, the respondent sent an administrative seizure to the National Bank of Canada to collect the amount of $58,100.39. Last, on March 10, 2006, a second notice of assessment was issued against the applicant in the amount of $96,275.28 for the deductions from employees' wages from April 1, 2005, to February 16, 2006. 
 
 
 
 [17] 
  It should be noted that the applicant's requirement to pay acknowledged that the $58,200.75 seized on January 27, 2006, should be applied to the $96,275.28 that was indicated in the second notice of assessment. 
 
 
 
 [18] 
  That being said, the applicant maintains that the second notice of assessment issued on March 10, 2006, replaced the first notice of assessment issued on January 17, 2006, and therefore any collection action before March 10, 2006, under the first notice of assessment should be set aside. Accordingly, the applicant seeks reimbursement of the $58,200.75 that was seized on January 25, 2006. 
 
 
 
 [19] 
  This position is not consistent with the jurisprudence of the Federal Court. In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Federal Court of Appeal wrote: 
 
 
 
 " 
 It follows that a reassessment of tax does not nullify the liability to pay the tax covered by the previous tax [sic] as long as that tax is included in the amount reassessed. 
  As there can be no basis for the appellant's contention on this motion unless the 'amount payable' on which the certificate was based had ceased to be 'payable' and as the material before us does not show that it had ceased to be payable, in our view, the appeal had to be dismissed. Indeed, the appeal was argued, as we understood the argument, on the assumption that the amounts on which the certificate was based were carried forward into the new assessments." (Emphasis added.) 
 
 
 
 [20] 
  I would add that the Federal Court of Appeal repeated these statements in  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
 [21] 
  In light of this jurisprudence, I am of the view that the administrative seizure that took place on January 27, 2006, is valid because the second notice of assessment did not nullify the amount of tax payable established in the first notice of assessment. The applicant may pursue its opposition to the assessment before the appropriate courts. If it is successful at the end of this process, it may be entitled to a refund pursuant to subsections 164(4.1) of the  
 ITA 
  and 96(3) of the  
 EIA 
 . 
 
 
 
 [22] 
  For these reasons, the Court dismisses the application for judicial review with costs. 
 
 
 
 ORDER 
 
 
 
 [23] 
   
 THE COURT ORDERS that 
  the application for judicial review is dismissed with costs. 
 
 
 
 Application dismissed.

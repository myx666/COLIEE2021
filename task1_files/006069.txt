INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC- 2001, c 27 (Act) for judicial review of the decision of an immigration officer (Officer), dated 16 November 2011 (Decision), which refused the Applicant's application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds under subsection 25(1) of the Act.
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicant is a 42-year-old citizen of Sudan. He currently lives in Toronto. He arrived in Canada and made a claim for refugee protection on 24 June 2003. His claim was rejected on 20 April 2005.
[3]
The Applicant submitted an H&C application on 4 December 2007. The Applicant relied on his establishment in Canada, and the risk that he faced if returned to Sudan. To support his H&C application, the Applicant provided several letters of reference and support from friends, employers, and colleagues in Toronto, as well as receipts for charitable donations and evidence that he has been furthering his education while in Canada. These letters praised the Applicant's commitment to volunteerism, as well as his strong work ethic and caring nature.
[4]
In a letter from the Applicant's employer, Forensic Support Services Inc., dated 30 October 2007, President Dennis Brooks states that the Applicant has a "strong work ethic" and has "earned our trust many times over." Mr. Brooks also says that the Applicant "has addressed the needs of many people facing issues of homelessness, mental health and addictions. Taj has always met this challenge with understanding, strong people skills, and good humour."
[5]
Letters were also included from the Scott Mission detailing the Applicant's involvement with their Meals on Wheels program, the Arab Community Centre of Toronto discussing the Applicant's volunteer administrative work, and the St. Felix Centre indicating the Applicant volunteered in their kitchen. The Executive Director of the St. Felix Centre states that "Taj is a positive, hard working, punctual and dedicated volunteer who we value immensely."
[6]
Through his employment, the Applicant has been involved with an organization called Lawyers Feed the Hungary. Jay Brecher, the volunteer coordinator, wrote in his letter of support that the Applicant has worked "with literally dozens of security personnel, and [he] can honestly say that Taj has distinguished himself as the most diligent, reliable and hard working of them all." Mr. Brecher elaborates as follows:
Taj routinely arrives before 6:00 am and eagerly helps the volunteers to prepare bag lunches for the guests, even though that is not within the scope of his duties as a security guard [...] Taj also has an incredibly positive disposition [...] In my opinion, Canada needs more people like Taj, who are hard-working, caring and optimistic. Hence, I strongly support his application to become a landed immigrant, and I hope that ultimately he is able to obtain Canadian citizenship ...
The Applicant also included a letter from the Sudanese Community Association of Ontario dated 7 November 2007 stating that the Applicant is a "very active and supportive member." The letter goes on to say that the Applicant "has always shown initiative in coming to the aid of the community and its members; never hesitated to stretch an arm to help the community in and by all means."
[7]
Friends and community members also wrote letters demonstrating the Applicant's ties to the community. In a letter dated 26 November 2007, the Applicant's friend Yasir Elsayid says that the Applicant has been very involved and helpful in the local community group they are involved in, and at one time prepared and distributed the food for over 25 people during Ramadan. Earl Babb, the Applicant's friend and former landlord states that the Applicant is "responsible, honest, trustworthy, reliable, punctual and dependable." Another friend, George Vincze, says the Applicant is "outstanding, loyal, and kind," and another, Lauren Bailey, say the Applicant is "honest, pleasant, and trustworthy." A friend and co-worker, Gary Blaize, writes in his letter that he often goes to the Applicant for advice, and that they have developed a strong friendship. He expresses his appreciation for the Applicant's "sense of honour, his maturity, his positive outlook on life, his appreciation for hard work and his respect for our way of life."
[8]
The Applicant also submitted certificates from the George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology indicating that he has completed courses in English, Mathematics, and Computer Literacy, as well as a letter from his ESL teacher attesting to his many positive attributes, such as his interest in different cultures and faiths. He also submitted letters acknowledging that he has made donations to organizations such as the Sick Kids Children Hospital, Police Association of Ontario, and the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs.
[9]
The Applicant also submitted country condition documents in regards to the situation in Sudan. These include materials from many different sources, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and newspapers, and most are dated in 2010 and 2011. The Applicant submitted updates to his materials in October 2010 and September 2011.
[10]
The Officer considered the Applicant's submissions and refused his application on 9 September 2011. The Officer notified the Applicant of the Decision by letter dated 21 September 2011 (Refusal Letter).
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[11]
The Decision in this case consists of the Refusal Letter and the H&C Reasons for Decision (Reasons) which the Officer signed on 16 November 2011.
[12]
The Officer reviewed the Applicant's biographical data and immigration history. The grounds upon which the application was based were stated as being the Applicant's establishment in Canada and the risk the Applicant would face if returned to Sudan. The Officer stipulated that the Applicant bore the onus of demonstrating that the hardship of having to obtain a permanent residence visa from outside Canada would be unusual and undeserved or disproportionate.
Establishment in Canada
[13]
The Officer drew a negative inference from the Applicant's period of unemployment from when he arrived in Canada until April 2005. The Applicant had not provided information on how he supported himself during this period. The Officer gave positive consideration to the employment the Applicant did find and his ability to financially support himself, as well as his reference letter from his current employer.
[14]
The Officer acknowledged the Applicant's letters of support from people in the community and gave positive consideration to his volunteer activities. The Officer noted the Applicant's involvement with Lawyers Feed the Hungry, and that he made sandwiches and gave his own time for the project. The Officer stated that letters of recommendation were on file.
Country Conditions
[15]
The Officer reiterated that the RPD found at the Applicant's refugee hearing that his claims of political involvement were not plausible. It also found that the Applicant was unlikely to be persecuted based on his ethnicity, as the evidence did not support that persons were being persecuted merely by being part Nuba and part Zande. The Officer also found that a letter from the Applicant's brother stating that officials had come to his home asking about the Applicant was vague and lacking in detail. The Officer point out that the Applicant's brother is of similar ethnicity, but did not indicate that he has been experiencing any difficulties.
[16]
Documentary evidence of country conditions found through the Officer's own independent research of publicly available sources was also considered. The Officer reviewed the history of the civil war in Sudan, and quoted materials from 2006 and 2007 stating that Sudan has one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa. The Officer stated that human rights abuses primarily occur in the Southern and Darfur region of Sudan, and neither of the places where the Applicant would be likely to reside, Kartoum or Port Sudan, are in these regions.
[17]
The Officer also pointed out that a letter from the Nuba Mountain International Association of Canada said that they are of the opinion that asylum seekers are at risk if they return to Sudan, but they did not provide an objective basis for this statement. The Officer found that the Applicant had not demonstrated how conditions in Sudan related to a personal hardship that he has raised.
[18]
The Officer found the Applicant had not shown he would suffer unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship if he applied for permanent residence from outside Canada. He had acquired training during his time in Canada that would be transferable, and he was born and raised in Sudan and still has family there. The Applicant's decision to remain in Canada after his refugee claim was rejected in April 2005 was within his control, and a measure of establishment is expected during this time. The Officer found that the Applicant did not face an unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship to warrant an exemption from the requirements of the Act.
ISSUES
[19]
The Applicant raises the following issues in this application:
i. Whether the Officer erred by failing to consider evidence of the Applicant's establishment in Canada;
ii. Whether the Officer erred by ignoring relevant evidence.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[20]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis.
[21]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada held that when reviewing an H&C decision, "considerable deference should be accorded to immigration Officers exercising the powers conferred by the legislation, given the fact-specific nature of the inquiry, its role within the statutory scheme as an exception, the fact that the decision-maker is the Minister, and the considerable discretion evidenced by the statutory language" (paragraph 62). Justice John O'Keefe followed this approach in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The standard of review applicable to both issues is reasonableness.
[22]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 47, and
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)v Khosa
, 2009 SCC 12 at paragraph 59. Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
STATUTORY PROVISIONS
[23]
The following provision of the Act is applicable in this proceeding:
25.
(1) The Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.
25.
(1) Le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada qui est interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant hors du Canada, étudier le cas de cet étranger; il peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des considérations d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger le justifient, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché.
ARGUMENTS
The Applicant
Establishment in Canada
[24]
The Applicant submits that the Officer did not conduct a reasonable analysis of his establishment in Canada. As Justice Michael Kelen said at paragraph 5 of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "the presumption that the decision-maker has considered all the evidence is a rebuttable one, and where the evidence in question is of significant probative value this Court can make a negative inference from the decision-maker's failure to mention it."
[25]
The Applicant also cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
The Court may infer that the administrative agency under review made the erroneous finding of fact "without regard to the evidence" from the agency's failure to mention in its reasons some evidence before it that was relevant to the finding, and pointed to a different conclusion from that reached by the agency. Just as a court will only defer to an agency's interpretation of its constituent statute if it provides reasons for its conclusion, so a court will be reluctant to defer to an agency's factual determinations in the absence of express findings, and an analysis of the evidence that shows how the agency reached its result.
On the other hand, the reasons given by administrative agencies are not to be read hypercritically by a court (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  required to refer to every piece of evidence that they received that is contrary to their finding, and to explain how they dealt with it (see, for example,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). That would be far too onerous a burden to impose upon administrative decision-makers who may be struggling with a heavy case-load and inadequate resources. A statement by the agency in its reasons for decision that, in making its findings, it considered all the evidence before it, will often suffice to assure the parties, and a reviewing court, that the agency directed itself to the totality of the evidence when making its findings of fact.
However, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact "without regard to the evidence":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). In other words, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts. Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact. Moreover, when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion, it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact.
[26]
The Officer stated that the Applicant's volunteer activities and ability to support himself financially were given "positive consideration," but then went on to state that "it is expected that persons seeking the benefit of Canada's immigration and refugee protection programs will show a degree of establishment during that time ..." The Applicant submits that just because he stayed in Canada after his refugee claim was denied does not negate the hardship he demonstrated he would suffer if removed to Sudan.
[27]
The Applicant provided extensive evidence of the hardship that he would suffer by uprooting him from his community in Canada. The Officer dismissed this without giving consideration to the Applicant's many submissions and letters of support, and this was unreasonable. The letters submitted by the Applicant were extremely positive, and provided strong support for his application. The Applicant lists the following examples that are not referred to in the Decision:
• A letter from the Sudanese Community Association of Ontario, describing the Applicant as a "very active and supportive member," and stating that his contribution to society has been "quite substantial";
• A letter from the Applicant's employer praising his work with people who are dealing with homelessness, mental health problems, and addictions;
• A letter from the Executive Director of the St. Felix Community Centre saying that the Applicant is a "dedicated volunteer who we value immensely";
• A letter from the Applicant's teacher, praising his ability to appreciate the different cultures and faiths that make up Toronto;
• A letter from Jay Brecher, the volunteer coordinator at Lawyers Feed the Hungry, which says that "...Canada needs more people like Taj, who are hard-working, caring and optimistic ... Knowing that Canada opens its doors to persons of exceptional character, like Taj Eltaher, makes me very proud to be Canadian";
• A letter from a co-worker stating that "it would be a [loss] to me and many others if Taj was no longer in our daily lives";
• Many other letters from the Applicant's friends and colleagues expressing their support for him and attesting to his strong ties to the community.
[28]
The Applicant submits that the significance of these letters goes beyond showing that he has been gainfully employed and has volunteered in the community; they demonstrate the Applicant's integration into the community such that uprooting him would cause undeserved hardship. The Officer showed no appreciation of this point and simply noted "positive consideration" of these submissions; he did not engage in any analysis of the hardship that would be caused by uprooting the Applicant from the community.
[29]
The Officer noted the Applicant's work history and volunteerism, and then said that "submissions include references and letters of support from colleagues and friends in the community." This is the only mention given by the Officer to these relationships. The Applicant's submissions were numerous and spanned a period of 4 years, yet they were given no consideration by the Officer. The Applicant submits that the Officer was not cognizant of the thrust of the letters which was to demonstrate that the Applicant's integration into Canadian society would result in significant hardship to himself and other members of the community if he were removed.
[30]
The Applicant submits that he explicitly stated in his H&C application that he has significant ties to the community, yet this important element of hardship was not considered at all by the Officer. The Applicant also made specific mention of his charitable donations and language classes, but these were simply mentioned in passing in the Decision.
[31]
The Applicant submits that the Officer is not required to mention every document available in the evidentiary record, but in this case the Officer failed to appreciate a central point in the Applicant's application and ignored a large portion of the relevant evidence. A major part of the Applicant's submissions as to hardship was the high degree of integration he has established in Canada, and it is not evident from the Decision that this key point was considered at all. The Applicant submits that this renders the Decision unreasonable.
[32]
The Applicant also submits that the Officer committed a reviewable error when he found that the Applicant was no more established than would be expected of anyone in Canada for that period of time, without paying any consideration to the Applicant's personal circumstances. The failure to consider personal circumstances has been deemed to be a reviewable error by the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[33]
Furthermore, the Applicant points out that he made his H&C application in 2007. He submits that his situation is analogous to the one in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Lin
], where the Court said at paragraph 3 that "the question of the Applicant's status in Canada is a result of a shared responsibility between the Applicant and the Respondent." The Applicant further submits that the Respondent's failure to render a decision for almost four years is unreasonable by itself, and moreover it surely cannot be used to discount the high level of integration that the Applicant has established for himself.
[34]
The Applicant submits that his situation does not fit into Citizenship and Immigration Canada's IP-5 Manual of what constitutes circumstances beyond an applicant's control. There is no evidence the Applicant failed to cooperate with Immigration officials, and he has been trying to regularize his status. He has filed his taxes with the Canada Revenue Agency. As stated in paragraph 3 of
Lin
, "[o]f course the Applicant continued to put down roots in Canada during this hiatus period; it is not a matter of accepting risk to do so, it is a matter of getting on with life while waiting, and waiting."
Country Conditions
[35]
The Applicant further submits that the Officer selectively read the country condition evidence, and did not pay any attention to negative country conditions submitted by the Applicant. The Officer noted that there is evidence of human rights abuses in Sudan, with "particular attention to the conflicts which have involved the Southern States and Darfur." Since the Applicant is not likely to return to either of these places, the Officer simply rejected all the negative country conditions. This was not reasonable.
[36]
The Applicant's submissions included many documents about country conditions in Sudan, and he regularly updated this material. His latest update, from September 2011, included many articles from reputable sources. The Officer did not refer to any of them, but conducted his own research into country conditions.
[37]
From the documents that were considered, the Officer selectively read portions of the evidence. These articles focused on South Kordofan and Darfur, but also included information about northern Sudan. For example, in a letter to the UN Security Council dated 12 May 2011 from Human Rights Watch, it expressed "grave concern and call for an end to Sudan's increased use of arbitrary detention, torture, and other forms of ill-treatment and excessive force to repress basic civil and political rights of expression and assembly across northern Sudan." Another article from Human Rights Watch, dated 6 June 2011, said that displaced people are detained in Darfur and in Khartoum. Khartoum was identified by the Officer as a likely place of residence for the Applicant.
[38]
In stating that Sudan's economy was booming, the Officer also cited sources from 2006 and 2007. The Officer had at his disposal documents such as the US Department of State Report on Human Rights: Sudan for 2011 [US DOS Report], so it is not reasonable that documents from 2006 and 2007 were given so much weight. In fact, the US DOS Report specifically states that there have been incidents of arrests and torture of activists in Khartoum, and well as numerous reports of arbitrary and unlawful killings by government agents.
[39]
The Applicant submits that this Decision is erroneous in the same way as the one in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . I also agree with the applicants that the panel appears to have ignored significant evidence which contradicted its findings on the issue of state protection and thus committed a reviewable error (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), 83 A.C.W.S. (3d) 264). It quoted lengthy sections of the DOS Report on Venezuela in support of its findings that Venezuela is a democratic country able to protect its citizens, but failed to mention other more relevant passages. The DOS Report states that "[p]oliticization of the judiciary and official harassment ... of the political opposition continued to characterize the human rights situation" in the country. It also specifically referred to violent disruptions of opposition marches and rallies by supporters of the government and the security forces, in which hundreds of people were injured.
14. As Justice John Evans observed  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> - <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at par. 17, "when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion, it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact." Such an inference is warranted in the case at bar.
15. Indeed, in a recent case where, as here, the contradictory evidence overlooked by the decision-maker was contained in the same document on which it relied in support of its finding, Justice James Russell concluded that "[a] review of the evidence before the Board reveals an extremely partial selectiveness in order to support conclusions that the evidence in total may well contradict." (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 124, at par. 26; see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 246 at par. 33).
[40]
In sum, the Applicant submits that the Officer ignored relevant evidence with respect to country conditions in Sudan that were contrary to its findings. The Officer also unreasonably assigned weight to documents from 2006 and 2007 when many reliable recent documents were available. The Officer failed to reasonably consider the hardship the Applicant will face upon return to Sudan, and the Applicant requests that the Decision be quashed for this reason.
The Respondent
[41]
The Respondent submits that the Applicant's arguments must be considered in the special context of the legislation governing H&C decisions. The Respondent reminds us that an H&C review offers an individual special and additional consideration for an exemption from Canadian immigration laws, and that a negative decision takes no rights away from an individual (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA). An H&C decision is an exceptional and highly discretionary decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  this case the Applicant simply did not satisfy the Officer that he would suffer unusual or undeserved or disproportionate hardship if he were to apply for permanent residence from outside Canada.
Establishment
[42]
An H&C decision does not turn on the issue of establishment; it is simply one of many factors to be considered (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Paragraph 20 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> says that
The guidelines could be seen as limiting a decision-maker's discretion as to when establishment can be considered as a factor for an H & C determination. Without anything more than reference to the guidelines themselves, I cannot agree with the applicants that the H & C officer was required to give some weight to their degree of establishment in Canada. It is a factor to be considered, but it is not, nor can it be, the determining factor, outweighing all others. The degree of attachment is relevant to the issue of whether the hardship flowing from having to leave Canada is unusual or disproportionate. It does not take those issues out of contention.
The Respondent submits that the issue of establishment is not determinative of the Applicant's application.
[43]
Furthermore, the weighing of a particular factor, in this case establishment in Canada, is for the Officer to determine (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This is a matter to which deference is owed ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).
[44]
In response to the Applicant's insinuation that the Officer must have erred by not granting an H&C application to a person which such admirable characteristics, the Respondent points to paragraphs 25-26 of the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
[...] when asked to review an H&C decision, the Court is often made aware that the person whose fate is being decided is a deserving human being who has the support of the Canadian community she or he has joined. From the perspective of that community I am sure that any decision that requires the person in question to leave must often seem perverse. But that is because the law of Canada does not say that it is possible to remain in Canada provided you are a deserving individual and a valued member of your community. The facts of the present case are fairly typical in the sense that Ms. Davoudifar has developed personal and community ties and has gained the respect of many people, and it is obvious to anyone that she would be far happier and better off in Canada, and that those she loves and supports would also be happier and better off if she remained in Canada.
But the Officer in this case, as in all H&C cases, was faced with a specific task. It was her job to decide this matter in accordance with the relevant jurisprudence ...
[45]
The Applicant has suggested that it was unreasonable for the Officer to state that the degree of establishment was in part the result of his attempts to remain in Canada after receiving a negative RPD decision in 2005. The Applicant, however, made a conscious decision to remain in Canada irrespective of the fact that there was a valid removal order against him. Justice Yves de Montigny addressed a similar argument in the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], at paragraphs 19, 22 and 23:
On the other hand, the fact that a removal order is stayed pending a PRRA application does not affect the validity of the removal order. The Applicants, knowing that further time in Canada waiting for their legal processes to be completed would mean more alleged difficulty in returning to their home country, and knowing that they had been ordered to be removed, made the choice to stay anyway. This cannot be equated to a "prolonged inability to leave Canada", which is one of the situations where the Applicant's degree of establishment may be a factor to be considered pursuant to section 11.2 of the IP5 Manual.
[...]
The Applicants relied on section 11.2 of the IP5 Manual, according to which an applicant's degree of establishment in Canada "may be a factor to consider in certain situations", one of which is when the "prolonged inability to leave Canada has led to establishment". A note to that section further adds that "establishment of the applicant up to the time of the H & C decision may be considered". It was submitted that without a proper and reasonable consideration of establishment, the Immigration Officer could not make a reasonable assessment of whether the family would suffer undue, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if returned to Argentina.
There are a number of answers to that submission. First of all, the public policy considerations outlined in the Immigration Manual do not bind the Minister and his agents (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). More importantly, it cannot be said that the exercise of all the legal recourses provided by the IRPA are circumstances beyond the control of the Applicant. A failed refugee claimant is certainly entitled to use all the legal remedies at his or her disposal, but he or she must do so knowing full well that the removal will be more painful if it eventually comes to it ...
The Respondent submits that the present case is in line with the reasoning in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Country Conditions
[46]
The Officer had no obligation to refer to all of the documentary evidence in its Decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)). Further, the reasons of an administrative officer do not need to be as comprehensive as those that would be generated by a tribunal that renders its decision following an adjudicative hearing (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[47]
That being said, the Respondent submits that the Officer did consider the basis of the Applicant's fear of returning to Sudan. Specifically, the Officer noted that the Applicant's alleged political activities were deemed not plausible by the RPD, and that the Applicant had not indicated how the documented human rights abuses in Sudan relate to his personal circumstances.
[48]
The Respondent states that "the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the officer about a particular situation that exists in their country and that their personal circumstances in relation to that situation make them worthy of positive discretion"  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Respondent submits that the Applicant has not done so in this case, and requests that this application be dismissed.
ANALYSIS
[49]
The Applicant makes a series of assertions about what the Officer overlooked and should have taken into account when assessing hardship. Some of these assertions have some basis; others do not. The question for the Court is whether the deficiencies in the Decision that can be substantiated are sufficient to render it unreasonable.
[50]
In my view, the Applicant's strongest point is that the establishment factor was not appropriately dealt with
[51]
The Officer says that he has:
read and considered in their entirety the applicant's Request for Exemption from the Requirement of a Permanent Resident visa application and submissions, his PRRA application and submissions and the Reasons for Decision of the RPD. In addition, I have considered the documentary evidence found through my own independent research of publicly available sources.
[52]
A reading of the Decision as a whole, however, suggests to me that, although the Officer may have read the evidence on establishment, he shows no awareness of the degree of establishment in this case, and hence the degree of hardship that is likely to be suffered by this Applicant if he is now required to leave Canada. I agree with the Respondent that establishment is only one of the factors that needs to be considered and weighed to arrive at an assessment of hardship. I also agree with the Respondent that this weighing process is very much part of the Officer's competence and discretion and the Court should be very reluctant to interfere. In the present case, however, establishment was obviously a highly significant aspect of the H&C application and so required appropriate analysis. What we have is a perfunctory acknowledgement of establishment which is then given "positive consideration." What is missing is a full appreciation of the degree of establishment and the hardship to which this is likely to give rise.
[53]
The Applicant argues that his references and letters of support were extremely positive and provide strong support for his application in that they show integration into the community to a degree that uprooting him would cause unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. He says the Officer showed no appreciation of this point. I agree.
[54]
The Officer's summary on point is as follows:
I have considered the factors that were raised by the applicant, both individually and cumulatively. I am satisfied that the difficulties the applicant may encounter in leaving Canada arise from the normal and foreseeable working of the law. The purpose of the law, and of public policy, is not to ameliorate all hardship; it is to mitigate unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
While I have given positive consideration to aspects of this application, I am not satisfied that there are grounds in this application for the exceptional response requested by the applicant. Given the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the factors constitute an unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship to warrant an exemption from the requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Act.
[55]
The Decision also shows that the Officer is aware that he should balance the difficulties and hardship that might arise from the Applicant's establishment in Canada against what awaits him in Sudan:
Return to Sudan is feasible. The skills and training that the applicant may have acquired during his time in Canada (such as English language) are reasonably transferable. The applicant was born and raised in Sudan. He is familiar with the language and culture of the country. The applicant has family in Sudan with whom he has maintained communication. It is reasonable to believe that they would assist in his reintegration, if only emotionally.
[56]
What is missing is an analysis of the degree of establishment in this case. The Applicant believes it is exceptional and would lead to exceptional hardship if he is removed. This was a highly significant aspect of the H&C application. The Officer did not have to agree with the Applicant but, on these facts, I think he did have to explain why he disagreed.
[57]
The same problem arose in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where the officer failed to appreciate the degree and extent of establishment, and did not properly consider the hardship related to that establishment. Justice Zinn warned in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 21, that "what is required is an analysis and assessment of the degree of establishment ... and how it weighs in favour of granting an exemption." I do not think this really occurs in the Decision before me. This does not mean, however, that I agree with other grounds raised by the Applicant.
[58]
The Applicant also says that the Officer erred by either ignoring or selectively reading the country condition evidence. In this case, however, the Applicant overlooks the Officer's conclusion:
The applicant has submitted numerous articles regarding general country conditions in Sudan. He is not named in the articles, nor has he informed as to how they relate to the personal hardship that he has raised such that they are unusual and undeserved or disproportionate.
[59]
The Officer also acknowledges and addresses the other documentary evidence and concedes that there are "well documented issues regarding general human rights abuses"in the Southern States and Darfur. However, the problem is that "the Applicant has not indicated how they relate to his personal circumstances."
[60]
The Officer only says that the articles pay "particular attention to the conflicts which have involved the Southern States and Darfur." This does not mean that the Officer does not consider the situation in Kartoum, which he specifically refers to:
The Applicant previously resided in Kartoum, he has family members who continue to reside in that city and his ex-wife resided in Port Sudan.
[61]
As the Respondent points out, the Officer also addresses the actual risk that the Applicant claims he would experience if returned to Sudan:
The applicant's submission of political involvement was determined not plausible by the RPD. Evidence before me does not support that the applicant's involvement in politics in Sudan in the 1990s is such that his return is a hardship that is unusual and undeserved or disproportionate. Nor does the evidence support that the applicant's ethnicity is such that return to Sudan is a hardship that is unusual and undeserved or disproportionate.
[62]
In other words, if there are risks and human rights abuses in Kartoum, the Applicant did not establish how
he
would be at risk there and the ensuring hardship that would result from his having to return. The Applicant has already been found not to be at risk by the RPD and under a PRRA.
[63]
In my view, the hardship resulting from risk was appropriately dealt with by the Officer, and I see no ignoring or selectivity with regard to evidence relevant to the Applicant and his personal circumstances or attributes on this issue.
[64]
The Applicant further argues that in assessing the situation on Sudan, the Officer ignores more recent documentation. What he does not say, however, is how, given the findings of the RPD and the PRRA, this more recent documentation places him at risk, or gives rise to a hardship that was not considered by the Officer.
[65]
At the judicial review hearing, the Applicant complained that the Officer's treatment of the letter from the Nuba Mountain International Association of Canada was unreasonable. He says that the Officer misses the point and fails to consider the risk he will confront on return as a failed asylum seeker.
[66]
The Officer specifically says that the Association is "of the opinion that asylum seekers are at risk if they return to Sudan," so the assertion of this risk is fully acknowledged.
[67]
The Association's letter says that it believes the Applicant will face unfair treatment and "may face persecution and torture" because "the government is holding all Sudanese asylum seekers and activists as responsible for the ICC's decision in issuing a warrant against Sudan President Omar Elbashir." The letter is also premised on "the situation in Sudan nowadays, and the unlawful arrest and treatment of activists and people from marginalized areas ...."
[68]
The Officer says that the Association's opinion does not provide "an objective basis" for the risks it asserts. There are several reasons why I do not think this is unreasonable. To begin with, the Association does not say how it knows these things, and what it has done to monitor the situation. Also, it makes assumptions about the Applicant's past experiences, which obviously come from the Applicant and which do not take into account the Applicant's negative RPD and PRRA decisions, which is what I believe the Officer means by the "letter does not inform as to the applicant's personal circumstances in Sudan ...."
[69]
The Association is clearly a supporter of the Applicant - who is a member - and accepts his version of what has happened to him in Sudan.
[70]
In the end, I cannot say that the Officer was unreasonable for requiring objective evidence to support an assertion that the government in Sudan is "holding all Sudanese asylum seekers and activists as responsible ..."
[71]
In conclusion, I think that the only ground of review that the Applicant has substantiated is the Officer's failure to reasonably consider the full extent of his establishment and the degree of hardship that is likely to result from this aspect of the Applicant's case. However, because this was such an important and material ground in his H&C application, I think this error renders the Decision unreasonable and that the matter requires reconsideration.
[72]
The Officer had an obligation to engage in the Applicant's
personal
evidence of establishment. As Justice Elizabeth Heneghan said in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
11 The Applicant submits that the Officer failed to consider her degree of establishment in Canada and erred in making the finding that the establishment was no more than would be expected of a person who has been in Canada for several years without status. The Officer said the following:
...the degree of establishment is nothing beyond the normal establishment that one would expect the applicants to have achieved in the circumstances. Accordingly, I do not find that the applicants' establishment in Canada is to such a degree that having to apply for permanent residence from outside of Canada would constitute unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
12 Relying on the decisions in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  argues that this conclusion, made without analysis of her particular circumstances, is erroneous. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Blais said the following at para. 29:
[29] In my view, the IC made an unreasonable finding of facts: the IC's conclusions that "their establishment is no more than is expected of any refugee who is given similar opportunities in Canada" and that she is "not satisfied that in their case, their establishment can be considered so different and significant that it differs from what is expected from any other person who resides in Canada while undergoing the refugee determination process" are patently unreasonable in the circumstances of this case.
13 The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision was made pursuant to the Act and pursuant to the Immigration Manual: Inland Processing 5: Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds. I see no basis in principle to disagree with the approach taken by the Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and I am satisfied that the Applicant has shown the Officer committed a reviewable error in the manner of addressing the issue of establishment.
[73]
Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[74]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application is allowed. The Decision is quashed and the matter is returned for reconsideration by a different officer.
2. There is no question for certification.

[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande, présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), sollicitant le contrôle judiciaire de la décision du 16 novembre 2011 (la décision) par laquelle un agent d'immigration (l'agent), a rejeté la demande de résidence permanente du demandeur fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire en vertu du paragraphe 25(1) de la Loi.
CONTEXTE
[2]
Le demandeur est un citoyen du Soudan âgé de 42 ans qui vit actuellement à Toronto. Il est arrivé au Canada et y a déposé une demande d'asile le 24 juin 2003. Sa demande a été rejetée le 20 avril 2005.
[3]
Le demandeur a déposé le 4 décembre 2007 une demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. Il a invoqué son établissement au Canada et les risques auxquels il serait exposé s'il était renvoyé au Soudan. À l'appui de sa demande, le demandeur a fourni plusieurs lettres de référence et de soutien de la part d'amis, d'employeurs et de collègues à Toronto de même que des reçus de dons de charité et la preuve qu'il avait poursuivi ses études pendant qu'il se trouvait au Canada. Les auteurs de ces lettres faisaient ressortir l'engagement du demandeur dans le domaine du bénévolat, sa solide éthique du travail et son empathie naturelle.
[4]
Dans une lettre rédigée par l'employeur du demandeur, Forensic Support Services Inc., datée du 30 octobre 2007, son président, Dennis Brooks, déclarait que le demandeur possédait une [traduction] « solide éthique de travail » et qu'il avait « mérité à maintes reprises sa confiance ». Monsieur Brooks poursuivait aussi en soulignant ce qui suit: [traduction] « ... [I] l a contribué à combler les besoins de nombreuses personnes aux prises avec des problèmes d'itinérance, de santé mentale et de toxicomanie. Taj a toujours relevé ce défi grâce à un esprit compréhensif, à d'excellentes aptitudes en relations interpersonnelles et à un très bon sens de l'humour. »
[5]
Ont aussi été incorporées au dossier une lettre de la Scott Mission, exposant le rôle du demandeur dans son programme de popote roulante [Meals on Wheels], une seconde de l'Arab Community Centre de Toronto qui décrit le travail administratif bénévole effectué par le demandeur, de même qu'une troisième du St. Felix Centre qui mentionne le travail du demandeur dans la cuisine de l'organisme. Selon le directeur exécutif du St. Felix Centre, [traduction] « Taj est un bénévole à l'esprit positif, travaillant, ponctuel et dévoué dont nous reconnaissons la très grande valeur ».
[6]
Grâce à son emploi, le demandeur a participé aux activités d'une organisation appelée Lawyers Feed the Hungry. Voici un extrait de la lettre de soutien rédigée par Jay Brecher, le coordonnateur bénévole, à l'appui du demandeur. Il y expliquait que ce dernier avait travaillé [traduction] « avec des dizaines de préposés à la sécurité et [qu'il était] nettement ressorti comme le plus appliqué, le plus fiable et le plus travaillant entre eux ». Voici d'autres explications fournies par M. Brecher:
[traduction]
Taj arrive habituellement avant 6 h et travaille activement à la préparation de sacs à lunch avec les bénévoles pour les invités, même si cela ne fait pas partie de ses tâches de gardien de sécurité [...] Taj a aussi une attitude extrêmement positive. À mon avis, le Canada a besoin de plus de personnes comme Taj, des gens travaillants, empathiques et optimistes. Par conséquent, j'appuie sans réserve sa demande en vue de l'obtention de la résidence permanente et j'espère qu'il obtiendra finalement la citoyenneté canadienne ...
Le demandeur a aussi fourni une lettre de la Sudanese Community Association de l'Ontario datée du 7 novembre 2007 selon laquelle le demandeur est un [traduction] « membre très actif et très utile ». L'auteur de la lettre poursuivait en soulignant que le demandeur [traduction] « avait toujours fait preuve d'initiative pour aider la collectivité et ses membres et qu'il n'avait jamais reculé devant les efforts pour venir en aide à la collectivité, sans lésiner sur les moyens ».
[7]
Des amis et des membres de la collectivité ont aussi rédigé des lettres faisant état des liens entre le demandeur et cette dernière. Dans une lettre datée du 26 novembre 2007, Yasir Elsayid, un ami du demandeur, déclarait que le demandeur avait joué un rôle très actif et très utile dans le groupe communautaire local envers lequel ils sont engagés et qu'il avait déjà préparé et distribué un repas à plus de 25 personnes pendant la période du ramadan. De l'avis d'Earl Babb, ami et ex-propriétaire du demandeur, le demandeur est [traduction] « sérieux, honnête, fiable et ponctuel ». Selon un autre ami, George Vincze, le demandeur est [traduction] « une personne exceptionnelle, loyale et affable » et, une amie, Lauren Bailey, jugeait le demandeur [traduction] « honnête, agréable à vivre et digne de confiance ». Gary Blaize, ami et collègue de travail, a écrit dans sa lettre qu'il demandait souvent des conseils au demandeur et que les deux hommes avaient tissé de solides liens d'amitié. Il y affirmait aimer chez le demandeur [traduction] « le sens de l'honneur, la maturité, la vision positive de la vie, l'amour du travail et le respect à l'égard de notre mode de vie ».
[8]
Le demandeur a aussi soumis des certificats du George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology démontrant qu'il a réussi des cours d'anglais, de mathématiques et d'initiation à l'ordinateur ainsi qu'une lettre de son professeur d'anglais langue seconde qui confirmait ses nombreuses qualités positives, comme son intérêt à l'égard des autres cultures et des autres religions. Il a aussi soumis des lettres attestant ses dons à des organisations comme le Sick Kids Children Hospital, la Police Association of Ontario et l'Association canadienne des chefs de pompiers.
[9]
Le demandeur a aussi déposé des documents relatifs à la situation au Soudan. Les documents proviennent de sources différentes, comme Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch et des articles de journaux; la plupart d'entre eux datent de 2010 et de 2011. Le demandeur a mis à jour en octobre 2010 et en septembre 2011 les documents présentés.
[10]
L'agent a tenu compte des observations du demandeur et a rejeté sa demande le 9 septembre 2011. L'agent a informé le demandeur de la décision dans une lettre datée du 21 septembre 2011 (la lettre de refus).
Décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[11]
La décision en l'espèce est composée à la fois de la lettre de refus et des motifs de la décision relative à la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire (les motifs) que l'agent a signés le 16 novembre 2011.
[12]
L'agent a passé en revue les données biographiques du demandeur et ses antécédents en matière d'immigration. La demande était fondée sur l'établissement du demandeur au Canada et les risques auxquels il serait exposé s'il était renvoyé au Soudan. L'agent a précisé qu'il incombait au demandeur de démontrer que les difficultés qu'il devrait surmonter pour obtenir un visa de résident permanent à partir de l'étranger seraient inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives.
Établissement au Canada
[13]
L'agent a tiré une inférence défavorable de la période de chômage du demandeur entre son arrivée au Canada et le mois d'avril 2005. Le demandeur n'avait pas fourni de renseignements sur ses moyens de subsistance au cours de cette période. L'agent a cependant accordé une attention particulière à l'emploi que le demandeur a trouvé et à sa capacité de subvenir financièrement à ses besoins de même qu'à la lettre de référence de son employeur actuel.
[14]
L'agent a tenu compte des lettres d'appui provenant de membres de la collectivité et il a accordé une attention particulière à ses activités de bénévolat. L'agent a souligné la participation du demandeur aux activités de l'organisation Lawyers Feed the Hungry et le fait qu'il avait préparé des sandwichs et donné de son temps au projet. L'agent a précisé que les lettres de recommandation figuraient au dossier.
Situation dans le pays
[15]
L'agent a rappelé que, selon les conclusions tirées par la SPR après l'audience relative à la demande d'asile du demandeur, les allégations de participation à des activités politiques de ce dernier n'étaient pas vraisemblables. Il a aussi conclu qu'il était peu probable que le demandeur soit persécuté du fait de son origine ethnique étant donné que la preuve ne démontrait pas que des personnes étaient persécutées uniquement parce qu'elles appartenaient en partie à l'ethnie Nuba et en partie à l'Ethnie Zandé. L'agent a aussi établi qu'une lettre rédigée par le frère du demandeur selon laquelle des fonctionnaires s'étaient rendus à son domicile pour s'informer au sujet des allées et venues du demandeur était vague et floue. L'agent souligne que le frère du demandeur a le même profil ethnique, mais qu'il n'a pas déclaré avoir été exposé à des difficultés à cet égard.
[16]
L'agent a aussi tenu compte de documents sur la situation dans le pays qu'il a trouvés dans le cadre de sa propre recherche à même des sources publiques. Il a pris connaissance de l'historique de la guerre civile au Soudan et a cité des documents de 2006 et de 2007 selon lesquels le Soudan était doté de l'une des économies africaines dont la croissance était la plus rapide. L'agent a indiqué que les violations des droits de la personne survenaient principalement dans le sud du Soudan et dans la région du Darfour; or, aucun des endroits où le demandeur serait susceptible d'habiter, soit Khartoum ou Port-Soudan, ne se trouve dans ces régions.
[17]
L'agent a également souligné que, selon une lettre de la Nuba Mountain International Association du Canada, les demandeurs d'asile courent des risques s'ils sont renvoyés au Soudan, mais l'Association ne fournissait pas de données objectives pour justifier cette affirmation. L'agent a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré de quelle façon la situation au Soudan était liée aux difficultés personnelles auxquelles il serait exposé.
[18]
L'agent a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas démontré qu'il serait exposé à des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives s'il demandait la résidence permanente à partir de l'étranger. Le demandeur avait acquis des compétences transférables pendant qu'il était au Canada, qu'il était né au Soudan et y avait été élevé et que sa famille y vivait encore. La décision du demandeur de demeurer au Canada après le rejet de sa demande d'asile en avril 2005 n'était pas indépendante de sa volonté et il lui incombait de s'établir au Canada pendant cette période. L'agent a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas exposé à des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives qui justifieraient une exemption de l'application des exigences de la Loi.
Questions en LITIGE
[19]
Le demandeur soulève les questions suivantes dans sa demande:
i. L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte des éléments de preuve qui démontraient l'établissement du demandeur au Canada?
ii. L'agent a-t-il commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte d'éléments de preuve pertinents?
NORME DE CONTRÔLE
[20]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour suprême du Canada a conclu qu'il n'est pas nécessaire de procéder dans tous les cas à une analyse relative à la norme de contrôle. Lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable à une question particulière dont la cour de révision est saisie est bien établie par la jurisprudence, la cour peut adopter cette norme. Ce n'est que lorsque cette recherche se révèle infructueuse que la cour de révision doit examiner les quatre facteurs dont est composée l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle.
[21]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada a statué que, dans les cas de contrôle d'une décision relative à une demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, « on devrait faire preuve d'une retenue considérable envers les décisions d'agents d'immigration exerçant les pouvoirs conférés par la loi, compte tenu de la nature factuelle de l'analyse, de son rôle d'exception au sein du régime législatif, du fait que le décideur est le ministre, et de la large discrétion accordée par le libellé de la loi » (au paragraphe 62). Le juge John O'Keefe a suivi ce principe dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . La norme de contrôle applicable à ces deux questions est celle de la décision raisonnable.
[22]
Lorsque la norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique, l'analyse porte sur « la justification de la décision, [...] la transparence et [...] l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel ainsi [que sur] l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».Voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47, et
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . En d'autres termes, la Cour devrait intervenir seulement si la décision n'est pas raisonnable en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».
DISPOSITIONS LÉGISLATIVES
[23]
La disposition suivante de la Loi s'applique en l'espèce.
25.
(1) Le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada qui est interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant hors du Canada, étudier le cas de cet étranger; il peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des considérations d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger le justifient, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché.
25.
(1) The Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.
ARGUMENTS
Le demandeur
Établissement au Canada
[24]
Le demandeur soutient que l'agent n'a pas effectué une analyse raisonnable de son établissement au Canada. Comme le juge Michael Kelen le soulignait au paragraphe 5 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  « la présomption selon laquelle le décideur a tenu compte de tous les faits est une présomption réfutable et, lorsque la valeur probante des faits en question est significative, la Cour peut considérer défavorablement l'absence de mention des faits en question dans les motifs du décideur ».
[25]
Le demandeur invoque aussi la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 17:
La Cour peut inférer que l'organisme administratif en cause a tiré la conclusion de fait erronée « sans tenir compte des éléments dont il [disposait] » du fait qu'il n'a pas mentionné dans ses motifs certains éléments de preuve dont il était saisi et qui étaient pertinents à la conclusion, et en arriver à une conclusion différente de celle de l'organisme. Tout comme un tribunal doit faire preuve de retenue à l'égard de l'interprétation qu'un organisme donne de sa loi constitutive, s'il donne des motifs justifiant les conclusions auxquelles il arrive, de même un tribunal hésitera à confirmer les conclusions de fait d'un organisme en l'absence de conclusions expresses et d'une analyse de la preuve qui indique comment l'organisme est parvenu à ce résultat.
Par ailleurs, les motifs donnés par les organismes administratifs ne doivent pas être examinés à la loupe par le tribunal (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  pas non plus les obliger à faire référence à chaque élément de preuve dont ils sont saisis et qui sont contraires à leurs conclusions de fait, et à expliquer comment ils ont traité ces éléments de preuve (voir, par exemple,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.)). Imposer une telle obligation aux décideurs administratifs, qui sont peut-être déjà aux prises avec une charge de travail imposante et des ressources inadéquates, constituerait un fardeau beaucoup trop lourd. Une simple déclaration par l'organisme dans ses motifs que, pour en venir à ses conclusions, il a examiné l'ensemble de la preuve dont il était saisi suffit souvent pour assurer aux parties, et au tribunal chargé du contrôle, que l'organisme a analysé l'ensemble de la preuve avant de tirer ses conclusions de fait.
Toutefois, plus la preuve qui n'a pas été mentionnée expressément ni analysée dans les motifs de l'organisme est importante, et plus une cour de justice sera disposée à inférer de ce silence que l'organisme a tiré une conclusion de fait erronée « sans tenir compte des éléments dont il [disposait] »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.). Autrement dit, l'obligation de fournir une explication augmente en fonction de la pertinence de la preuve en question au regard des faits contestés. Ainsi, une déclaration générale affirmant que l'organisme a examiné l'ensemble de la preuve ne suffit pas lorsque les éléments de preuve dont elle n'a pas discuté dans ses motifs semblent carrément contredire sa conclusion. Qui plus est, quand l'organisme fait référence de façon assez détaillée à des éléments de preuve appuyant sa conclusion, mais qu'elle passe sous silence des éléments de preuve qui tendent à prouver le contraire, il peut être plus facile d'inférer que l'organisme n'a pas examiné la preuve contradictoire pour en arriver à sa conclusion de fait.
[26]
L'agent a déclaré que les activités de bénévolat du demandeur de même que sa capacité d'être autonome sur le plan financier avaient reçu une [traduction] « attention particulière », mais il a poursuivi en soulignant [traduction] « qu'il est prévu que les personnes qui cherchent à bénéficier des programmes d'immigration et de protection des réfugiés du Canada démontrent un certain degré d'établissement pendant cette période ... ». Le demandeur soutient que le simple fait qu'il soit demeuré au Canada après le rejet de sa demande d'asile n'enlève rien à la preuve qu'il a établie au sujet des difficultés auxquelles il serait exposé s'il était renvoyé au Soudan.
[27]
Le demandeur a fourni de nombreux éléments de preuve pour établir les difficultés auxquelles il serait exposé s'il était déraciné de sa collectivité au Canada. L'agent a rejeté ces éléments de preuve, sans tenir compte des nombreuses observations et lettres d'appui du demandeur, ce qui était déraisonnable. Les lettres soumises par le demandeur avaient un ton extrêmement positif et militaient fortement en faveur de sa demande. Le demandeur énumère les exemples ci-après qui ne sont pas mentionnés dans la décision:
• Une lettre de la Sudanese Community Association of Ontario, décrivant le demandeur comme un [traduction] « membre très actif et très utile » et précisant que son apport avait été [traduction] « vraiment substantiel ».
• Une lettre de l'employeur du demandeur décrivant favorablement son travail auprès de personnes itinérantes et de personnes souffrant de problèmes de santé mentale et de toxicomanie.
• Une lettre du directeur général du Felix Community Centre décrivant comme suit le demandeur: « [U]n bénévole à l'esprit positif, travaillant, ponctuel et dévoué dont nous reconnaissons la très grande valeur. »
• Une lettre du professeur du demandeur, qui vantait sa capacité d'apprécier à leur juste valeur les diverses cultures et croyances religieuses qui forment le tissu de la ville de Toronto.
• Une lettre de Jay Brecher, coordonnateur des bénévoles à l'organisation Lawyers Feed the Hungry, dont voici un extrait: [traduction] « ... [L]e Canada a besoin de plus de personnes comme Taj, des gens travaillants, empathiques et optimistes ... Le simple fait de savoir que le Canada ouvre ses portes à des personnes qui possèdent des qualités exceptionnelles comme Taj Eltaher me rend très fier d'être Canadien. »
• Voici un extrait d'une lettre d'un collègue du demandeur: [traduction] « [L]'absence de Taj dans nos vies serait une grande perte pour moi-même et bien d'autres personnes. »
• Bien d'autres lettres d'amis et collègues du demandeur exprimant leur soutien à son égard et confirmant les liens solides qui le rattachent à la collectivité.
[28]
Selon le demandeur, ces lettres ne montrent pas simplement qu'il a occupé un emploi rémunéré et qu'il a fait du bénévolat dans la collectivité; elles démontrent que l'intégration du demandeur à la collectivité est telle que son déracinement l'exposerait à des difficultés excessives. L'agent n'a pas tenu compte de cet élément et a simplement mentionné avoir accordé une [traduction] « attention particulière » à ces observations; il ne s'est pas livré à une analyse des difficultés qu'entrainerait le déracinement du demandeur de la collectivité.
[29]
L'agent a pris note des antécédents de travail et des activités de bénévolat du demandeur et a ajouté que [traduction] « les observations comprennent des références et des lettres d'appui de collègues et d'amis de la collectivité ». C'est la seule mention qu'a faite l'agent de ces relations. Or, les observations du demandeur étaient nombreuses et couvraient une période de quatre ans; malgré cela, l'agent n'en a pas tenu compte. Le demandeur soutient que l'agent n'a pas saisi l'essence même des lettres, soit démontrer, étant donné l'intégration du demandeur à la société canadienne, que son renvoi entrainerait des difficultés importantes pour lui-même et d'autres membres de la collectivité.
[30]
Le demandeur soutient qu'il a explicitement déclaré dans sa demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire qu'il avait établi des liens importants avec la collectivité; or, cet élément important des difficultés auxquelles il serait exposé en cas de renvoi n'a pas du tout été abordé par l'agent. Le demandeur a aussi mentionné spécifiquement ses dons de charité et les cours de langue qu'il a suivis, mais ces éléments ont été simplement cités de façon accessoire dans la décision.
[31]
Selon le demandeur, il est vrai que l'agent n'est pas tenu de mentionner chaque document qui fait partie du dossier de la preuve mais, en l'espèce, il a omis d'évaluer un élément essentiel de la demande et a laissé de côté une grande partie des éléments de preuve pertinents. Le degré élevé d'intégration du demandeur au Canada était un élément important des observations du demandeur quant aux difficultés auxquelles il serait exposé et rien ne permet de conclure que cet élément essentiel a été abordé. Le demandeur estime donc que, pour cette raison, la décision est déraisonnable.
[32]
Le demandeur soutient aussi que l'agent a commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle lorsqu'il a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas mieux établi au Canada que le serait toute personne y ayant vécu pendant la même période, sans prendre en compte de quelque façon que ce soit la situation particulière du demandeur. La Cour fédérale a déjà statué que le défaut de tenir compte de la situation personnelle des demandeurs constituait une erreur susceptible de contrôle (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[33]
De plus, le demandeur souligne qu'il a déposé sa demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire en 2007. Il allègue que sa situation est semblable à celle qui est visée dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Lin
], où la Cour énonçait notamment ce qui suit au paragraphe 3: « [L]a demanderesse et le défendeur ont une responsabilité partagée à l'égard du statut de l'intéressée au Canada. » Le demandeur ajoute que le défaut du défendeur de rendre une décision pendant une période de près de quatre ans est déraisonnable en soi; de plus, ce délai ne peut être invoqué pour réduire la valeur du degré élevé d'intégration à la société que le demandeur a réussi à atteindre.
[34]
Le demandeur allègue que sa situation ne correspond pas à la définition que présente le manuel IP-5 de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada de ce que constituent « des circonstances indépendantes de [la] volonté » d'un demandeur. Rien ne démontre que le demandeur n'a pas collaboré avec les fonctionnaires de l'immigration; de plus, il a tenté de régulariser sa situation. Il a produit ses déclarations de revenus à l'Agence du revenu du Canada. Comme il est mentionné au paragraphe 3 de la décision
Lin
, « la demanderesse a naturellement continué pendant ce temps à s'enraciner au Canada; elle n'a pas accepté un risque en agissant ainsi, elle a simplement tenté de continuer à vivre normalement en attendant ».
Situation dans le pays
[35]
Le demandeur allègue de plus que l'agent a lu de façon sélective les données sur la situation dans le pays et qu'il n'a pas accordé d'attention aux éléments négatifs liés à cette situation qui ont été soumis par le demandeur. L'agent a souligné que des éléments de preuve démontrent l'existence de violations des droits de la personne au Soudan [traduction] « relativement aux conflits qui ont surgi dans les États du sud du pays et au Darfour ». Étant donné que le demandeur ne retournera vraisemblablement pas dans l'un de ces endroits, l'agent a simplement rejeté toutes les données négatives sur la situation dans le pays, ce qui n'était pas raisonnable.
[36]
Les observations du demandeur comprenaient de nombreux documents sur la situation au Soudan et il les a mis à jour périodiquement. La dernière mise à jour, qui datait de septembre 2011, contenait de nombreux articles de sources fiables. L'agent n'a mentionné aucun de ces documents, mais il a effectué sa propre recherche sur la situation dans le pays.
[37]
Dans tous les documents qui ont été pris en compte, l'agent n'a choisi que certains éléments. Ces articles portaient sur le Kordofan-Sud et le Darfour, mais contenaient aussi des renseignements sur le nord du Soudan. Par exemple, l'organisme Human Rights Watch, dans une lettre adressée au Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies datée du 12 mai 2011, se disait [traduction] « très inquiète et appelait les autorités compétentes à faire cesser l'utilisation accrue de la détention arbitraire, de la torture et d'autres formes de mauvais traitements ainsi que de l'usage excessif de la force pour réprimer les droits civils et politiques fondamentaux d'expression et de réunion dans tout le nord du Soudan ». Selon un autre article de Human Rights Watch, daté du 6 juin 2011, des personnes déplacées étaient détenues au Darfour et à Khartoum. Or, l'agent avait désigné Khartoum comme un lieu de résidence potentiel du demandeur.
[38]
Lorsqu'il a affirmé que l'économie du Soudan était prospère, l'agent a aussi cité des sources de 2006 et de 2007. Il avait à sa disposition des documents comme le rapport du Département d'État des États-Unis sur les droits de la personne au Soudan en 2011 [US Department of State Report on Human Rights: Sudan for 2011] [Rapport du Département d'État américain], de sorte qu'il n'était pas raisonnable d'accorder autant de valeur à des documents datant de 2006 et de 2007. En fait, le Rapport du Département d'État américain précise nommément que des incidents impliquant l'arrestation et la torture de militants à Khartoum s'étaient déroulés et cite de nombreux rapports sur les assassinats arbitraires perpétrés par des agents de l'État.
[39]
Le demandeur soutient que la décision est erronée de la même façon que celle qui avait été prise dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Je suis également d'accord avec les demandeurs pour dire que le tribunal semble avoir négligé des éléments de preuve importants qui contredisent ses conclusions sur la question de la protection de l'État et qu'il a donc commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.), 83 A.C.W.S. (3d) 264). Il a cité de longs passages du rapport du Département d'État sur le Venezuela à l'appui de ses conclusions selon lesquelles le Venezuela est un pays démocratique en mesure de protéger ses citoyens, mais il a omis de mentionner d'autres passages plus pertinents. Le rapport du Département d'État déclare que la [traduction] « [p] olitisation de la magistrature et le harcèlement exercé par les autorités [...] auprès des opposants politiques ont continué à définir la situation des droits de la personne » dans ce pays. Il a également expressément mentionné les troubles violents lors des marches et des manifestations d'opposition - lesquels troubles avaient été causés par les partisans du gouvernement et les forces de sécurité - au cours desquelles des centaines de personnes ont été blessées.
14. Comme l'a déclaré le juge John Evans au paragraphe 17 de la décision Cepeda-Gutierrez, précitée, « quand l'organisme fait référence de façon assez détaillée à des éléments de preuve appuyant sa conclusion, mais qu'elle passe sous silence des éléments de preuve qui tendent à prouver le contraire, il peut être plus facile d'inférer que l'organisme n'a pas examiné la preuve contradictoire pour en arriver à sa conclusion de fait ».Une telle inférence est justifiée en l'espèce.
15. En effet, dans une affaire récente dans laquelle, comme en l'espèce, la preuve contradictoire négligée par le décideur se trouvait dans le même document sur lequel il s'est fondé pour étayer sa conclusion, le juge James Russell a conclu qu'« [u]ne analyse de la preuve dont disposait la Commission révèle le caractère extrêmement sélectif de la Commission dans le choix de la preuve sur laquelle elle s'est fondée pour étayer ses conclusions, lesquelles pourraient bien être contredites par la preuve dans son ensemble ». (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 124, paragraphe 26; voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 246, paragraphe 33).
[40]
En résumé, le demandeur allègue que l'agent n'a pas tenu compte d'éléments de preuve pertinents relatifs à la situation au Soudan qui étaient contraires à ses conclusions. L'agent a aussi, de façon déraisonnable, accordé de la valeur à des documents de 2006 et 2007 alors que de nombreux documents récents et fiables existaient. L'agent n'a pas évalué de façon raisonnable les difficultés auxquelles le demandeur serait exposé à son retour au Soudan et ce dernier demande que, pour ce motif, la décision soit annulée.
Le défendeur
[41]
Le défendeur soutient que les arguments du demandeur doivent être examinés dans le contexte particulier des dispositions législatives qui régissent les décisions relatives à des demandes fondées sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. Le défendeur nous rappelle qu'un examen fondé sur ces motifs permet à l'intéressé de bénéficier d'une évaluation particulière et supplémentaire en vue d'une exemption de l'application des lois canadiennes sur l'immigration et qu'une décision défavorable n'enlève à l'intéressé aucun des droits qu'il possède déjà (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF). Une décision fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire a un caractère exceptionnel et nettement discrétionnaire (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et, en l'espèce, le demandeur n'a tout simplement pas convaincu l'agent qu'il serait exposé à des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives s'il devait faire sa demande de résidence permanente à partir de l'étranger.
Établissement
[42]
Une décision relative à une demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire ne concerne pas la question de l'établissement. En effet, ce dernier est simplement l'un des nombreux facteurs à prendre en compte (
Irimie,
précitée). Voici le paragraphe 20 de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Il serait possible de considérer que ces lignes directrices limitent le pouvoir discrétionnaire que possède le décideur au sujet des circonstances dans lesquelles l'établissement peut être considéré comme un facteur aux fins de la décision relative aux raisons d'ordre humanitaire. En l'absence d'un élément autre que les lignes directrices elles-mêmes, je ne puis être d'accord avec les demandeurs lorsqu'ils disent que l'agente qui a examiné la demande fondée sur des raisons d'ordre humanitaire était tenue d'accorder une certaine importance au degré d'établissement au Canada. Il s'agit d'un facteur dont il faut tenir compte, mais ce n'est pas et cela ne peut pas être le facteur déterminant qui l'emporte sur tous les autres. Le degré d'attachement se rapporte à la question de savoir si la difficulté découlant du fait qu'une personne doit quitter le Canada est inhabituelle ou excessive. Il n'a pas pour effet de régler ces questions.
Le défendeur soutient que la question de l'établissement n'est pas suffisante pour disposer de la demande.
[43]
De plus, le poids relatif d'un facteur donné, en l'espèce l'établissement au Canada, relève du pouvoir discrétionnaire de l'agent (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). C'est une question à l'égard de laquelle il faut faire preuve de déférence ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité).
[44]
En réponse au demandeur qui laisse entendre que l'agent a probablement commis une erreur en n'accueillant pas une demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire déposée par une personne possédant des caractéristiques aussi admirables, le défendeur cite les paragraphes 25 et 26 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
... lorsque la Cour est invitée à revoir une décision se rapportant à des considérations humanitaires, elle est souvent informée que la personne dont le sort est entre ses mains est un être humain méritant qui a le soutien de la population canadienne à laquelle elle s'est jointe. Je suis sûr que, de l'avis de la population, toute décision obligeant la personne en question à partir doit souvent sembler perverse. Mais, s'il en est ainsi, c'est parce que les lois du Canada ne disent pas qu'il vous est possible de rester au Canada dès lors que vous êtes une personne méritante et un membre apprécié de votre collectivité. Les circonstances de la présente affaire sont assez communes, en ce sens que Mme Davoudifar a développé des liens personnels et des liens avec la collectivité et qu'elle a gagné le respect de beaucoup de gens, et il est évident pour quiconque qu'elle serait beaucoup plus heureuse et se sentirait mieux au Canada et que ceux qu'elle aime et soutient seraient eux aussi plus heureux et se sentiraient mieux si elle restait au Canada.
Mais dans cette affaire, comme dans toutes les affaires portant sur l'existence de considérations humanitaires, l'agente devait accomplir une tâche particulière. Il lui incombait de rendre une décision conforme à la jurisprudence applicable ...
[45]
Le demandeur a laissé entendre qu'il était déraisonnable de la part de l'agent de déclarer que le degré d'établissement résultait en partie des tentatives du demandeur de demeurer au Canada après avoir fait l'objet d'une décision défavorable de la SPR en 2005. Cependant, le demandeur a décidé en toute connaissance de cause de demeurer au Canada, malgré le fait qu'une ordonnance de renvoi valide avait été rendue contre lui. Le juge Yves de Montigny a abordé un argument semblable dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], aux paragraphes 19, 22 et 23:
D'un autre côté, le fait qu'il soit sursis à une ordonnance de renvoi jusqu'à l'issue de la demande d'ERAR n'affecte pas la validité de cette mesure de renvoi. Les demandeurs, sachant très bien que plus longtemps ils resteraient au Canada dans l'attente que le processus judiciaire arrive à son terme, plus il serait difficile de retourner dans leur pays d'origine, et sachant qu'il leur avait été ordonné de quitter le pays, ont choisi de rester malgré tout. Cette situation ne s'apparente pas à une « incapacité prolongée à quitter le Canada », l'une des situations où le niveau d'établissement du demandeur au Canada peut être pris en compte, comme le prévoit la section 11.2 du chapitre IP5 du Guide.
[...]
Les demandeurs s'appuient sur la section 11.2 du chapitre IP5 du Guide, selon lequel le degré d'établissement du demandeur au Canada « peut être un facteur à considérer dans certains cas », notamment dans un cas d'« incapacité prolongée à quitter le Canada aboutissant à l'établissement ». Dans une note figurant dans la même section, il est précisé ce qui suit: « On peut tenir compte de l'établissement du demandeur jusqu'au moment de la décision CH ». L'avocat des demandeurs soutient qu'en l'absence d'un examen approprié et raisonnable de l'établissement, l'agente d'immigration ne pouvait pas raisonnablement évaluer si la famille subirait une difficulté inhabituelle ou injustifiée ou des difficultés démesurées advenant son renvoi en Argentine.
Il y a plusieurs manières de répondre à cet argument. Premièrement, le facteur d'intérêt public dont il est question dans le Guide de l'immigration ne lie pas le ministre et ses mandataires (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Plus important encore, on ne peut pas dire que l'exercice de tous les recours prévus par la LIPR corresponde à des circonstances échappant au contrôle du demandeur. Le demandeur qui se voit refuser le statut de réfugié est parfaitement en droit d'épuiser tous les recours mis à sa disposition par la loi mais il doit savoir que ce faisant, son éventuel renvoi en sera d'autant plus pénible ...
Le défendeur soutient que le raisonnement tenu dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> s'applique en l'espèce.
Situation dans le pays
[46]
L'agent n'était pas tenu de mentionner dans sa décision tous les éléments de preuve documentaires (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)). De plus, il n'est pas nécessaire que les motifs d'un agent administratif soient aussi détaillés que ceux d'un tribunal administratif qui rend sa décision après des audiences en règle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[47]
Par contre, le défendeur soutient que l'agent a tenu compte des éléments essentiels de la crainte du demandeur d'être renvoyé au Soudan. Plus précisément, l'agent a souligné que la SPR avait jugé non vraisemblables les activités politiques alléguées du demandeur et que ce dernier n'avait pas montré de quelle façon les violations des droits de la personne au Soudan, confirmées par la preuve documentaire, s'appliquaient à sa situation personnelle.
[48]
Le défendeur cite l'extrait suivant de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : « C'est au demandeur qu'il appartient de prouver à l'agent qu'il existe une situation particulière dans son pays et que sa situation personnelle eu égard à cette situation particulière justifie l'exercice favorable de son pouvoir discrétionnaire. » Le défendeur soutient que le demandeur n'a pas réussi à faire cette preuve en l'espèce et sollicite par conséquent le rejet de la demande.
ANALYSE
[49]
Le demandeur formule une série d'allégations au sujet des éléments que l'agent a écartés, mais dont il aurait dû tenir compte pour évaluer les difficultés auxquelles il serait exposé. Certaines de ces allégations ont un certain fondement, d'autres non. La Cour doit se demander si les lacunes de la décision dont l'existence peut être démontrée sont suffisantes pour la rendre déraisonnable.
[50]
À mon avis, l'argument le plus solide du demandeur tient au fait que le facteur de l'établissement n'a pas été correctement abordé.
[51]
Voici de quelle façon l'agent expose ce qu'il a fait:
[traduction]
J'ai lu et pris en compte dans leur totalité la demande d'exemption de l'exigence d'un visa de résident permanent de même que les observations qui l'accompagnaient, sa demande d'ERAR et les observations qui l'accompagnaient de même que les motifs de la décision de la SPR. De plus, j'ai tenu compte de la preuve documentaire que j'ai réunie par ma propre recherche à même des sources publiques.
[52]
Cependant, la lecture de la décision dans son ensemble me donne à penser que même si l'agent a pu lire les éléments de preuve sur l'établissement, rien n'indique qu'il a bien saisi l'importance de l'établissement du demandeur en l'espèce et, par conséquent, l'ampleur des difficultés auxquelles le demandeur serait vraisemblablement exposé s'il est maintenant tenu de quitter le Canada. Je reconnais avec le défendeur que l'établissement n'est qu'un des facteurs à prendre en compte et à évaluer pour statuer sur la question des difficultés. Je suis aussi d'accord avec le défendeur selon qui le processus d'évaluation de la preuve relève tout à fait de la compétence et du pouvoir discrétionnaire de l'agent et que la Cour doit hésiter beaucoup à intervenir. Cependant, en l'espèce, l'établissement était de toute évidence un aspect très important de la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire et, par conséquent, il exigeait une analyse appropriée. Or, nous n'avons en l'espèce qu'une reconnaissance superficielle de l'établissement auquel une [traduction] « attention particulière » est accordée. Je constate toutefois l'absence d'une évaluation complète du degré d'établissement et des difficultés auxquelles le renvoi est susceptible de donner lieu dans ce contexte.
[53]
Le demandeur soutient que ses références et les lettres d'appui étaient extrêmement positives et qu'elles venaient étayer solidement sa demande parce qu'elles révélaient son intégration dans la collectivité à un point tel que son déracinement entrainerait des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives. Il allègue que l'agent n'a pas tenu compte de cet élément. Je suis d'accord.
[54]
Voici le résumé de l'agent sur cette question:
[traduction]
J'ai tenu compte des facteurs mentionnés par le demandeur, tant séparément que cumulativement. Je suis convaincu que les difficultés auxquelles le demandeur pourrait être exposé en quittant le Canada découlent du fonctionnement normal et prévisible de la loi. L'objet de la loi et des politiques publiques n'est pas d'alléger toutes les difficultés; il consiste plutôt à atténuer les difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives.
S'il est vrai que j'ai accordé une attention particulière à certains aspects de la présente demande, je ne suis pas convaincu qu'il s'y trouve des motifs suffisants pour justifier l'intervention exceptionnelle qu'aimerait obtenir le demandeur. Étant donné la preuve dont je suis saisi, je ne suis pas convaincu que les facteurs en cause équivalent à des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives qui justifieraient une exemption des exigences de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
.
[55]
La décision révèle aussi que l'agent savait qu'il devait soupeser les difficultés qui pourraient résulter de l'établissement du demandeur au Canada comparativement à celles qui l'attendraient au Soudan:
[traduction]
Le retour au Soudan est possible. Les compétences et la formation que le demandeur a pu acquérir au cours de son séjour au Canada (comme sa connaissance de la langue anglaise) se transfèrent assez bien. Le demandeur est né au Soudan et y a été élevé. Il en connaît la langue et la culture. Le demandeur a au Soudan de la famille avec les membres de laquelle il est demeuré en communication. Il est raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'ils facilitent sa réintégration, ne serait-ce que sur le plan émotif.
[56]
L'analyse du degré d'établissement est absente en l'espèce. Le demandeur estime que ce degré d'établissement est exceptionnel et qu'il entrainerait des difficultés exceptionnelles s'il était renvoyé. Il s'agissait d'un aspect extrêmement important de la demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. L'agent n'était pas tenu d'être d'accord avec le demandeur mais, en ce qui concerne ces faits, je pense qu'il devait expliquer pour quels motifs il était en désaccord.
[57]
Le même problème s'est produit dans l'affaire visée par la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dans laquelle l'agent n'avait pas évalué le degré et l'ampleur de l'établissement et n'avait pas dûment tenu compte des difficultés liées à cet établissement. Au paragraphe 21 de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Zinn faisait la mise en garde suivante: « [L]a présente affaire commande une analyse et une évaluation du degré d'établissement ... et de la mesure dans laquelle cet élément joue en faveur de l'octroi d'une dispense. » Je ne pense pas que ce fut vraiment le cas dans le cadre de la décision que j'examine. Cependant, cela ne signifie pas que je suis d'accord avec les autres motifs invoqués par le demandeur.
[58]
Le demandeur affirme aussi que l'agent a commis une erreur en laissant de côté les éléments de preuve relatifs à la situation dans le pays ou en se montrant sélectif à leur sujet. Cependant, en l'espèce, le demandeur ne tient pas compte de la conclusion de l'agent:
[traduction]
Le demandeur a déposé de nombreux articles relatifs à la situation générale au Soudan. Il n'est pas nommé dans les articles et il ne s'est pas informé au sujet de la façon dont la situation dans le pays influence les difficultés auxquelles il disait craindre d'être exposé seraient inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives.
[59]
L'agent prenait en compte les autres éléments de preuve documentaires et reconnaissait que [traduction] « l'existence de violations généralisées des droits de la personne [était] bien étayée » dans les États du sud du pays et au Darfour. Cependant, le problème vient du fait que [traduction] « le demandeur n'a pas indiqué de quelle façon ces violations étaient liées à sa situation personnelle ».
[60]
L'agent dit seulement que les articles [traduction] « accordent une attention particulière aux conflits qui se sont déroulés dans les États du sud du pays et au Darfour ». Cela ne signifie pas que l'agent n'a pas tenu compte de la situation à Khartoum, qu'il mentionne pourtant explicitement:
[traduction]
Le demandeur a déjà habité Khartoum et des membres de sa famille habitent encore cette ville; son ex-épouse a déjà vécu à Port-Soudan.
[61]
Comme le souligne le défendeur, l'agent aborde aussi les risques réels auxquels le demandeur dit être exposé s'il était renvoyé au Soudan:
[traduction]
L'allégation du demandeur selon laquelle il aurait participé à des activités politiques a été jugée invraisemblable par la SPR. La preuve qui m'a été présentée ne me permet pas de conclure que la participation du demandeur à des activités politiques au Soudan au cours de la décennie 1990 est telle que son retour dans ce pays l'exposerait à des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives. La preuve ne permet pas non plus de conclure que l'origine ethnique du demandeur ferait en sorte que son retour au Soudan entrainerait pour lui des difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives.
[62]
En d'autres termes, même s'il existe des risques et des violations des droits de la personne à Khartoum, le demandeur n'a pas démontré de quelle façon il serait
lui-même
exposé à des risques dans cette ville non plus que l'existence des difficultés qui résulteraient de son obligation d'y retourner. La SPR et un agent chargé de l'ERAR avaient déjà établi qu'il n'était pas exposé à des risques.
[63]
À mon avis, la question des difficultés liées aux risques auxquels il serait exposé a été bien abordée par l'agent et je ne pense pas que ce dernier ait laissé de côté ou consulté sélectivement les éléments de preuve pertinents pour le demandeur de même que sa situation ou ses caractéristiques personnelles relativement à cette question.
[64]
Le demandeur ajoute que dans son évaluation de la situation au Soudan, l'agent n'a pas tenu compte de documents plus récents. Cependant, il ne dit pas, compte tenu des conclusions de la SPR et de l'agent chargé de l'ERAR, de quelle façon ces documents plus récents montrent qu'il est exposé à des risques ou font état de difficultés qui n'ont pas été prises en compte par l'agent.
[65]
Lors de l'audience relative au contrôle judiciaire, le demandeur a affirmé que le traitement qu'a fait l'agent de la lettre de la Nuba Mountain International Association of Canada était déraisonnable. Il allègue que l'agent est passé à côté de la question et qu'il n'a pas tenu compte des risques auxquels il serait exposé lors de son retour au pays en tant que demandeur d'asile débouté.
[66]
L'agent a précisément indiqué que l'Association [traduction] « est d'avis que les demandeurs d'asile sont exposés à des risques s'ils sont renvoyés au Soudan »; l'assertion relative à ce risque a donc été pleinement prise en compte.
[67]
Selon la position exprimée par l'Association dans sa lettre, le demandeur risque d'être soumis à de mauvais traitements ainsi qu'à [traduction] « la persécution et la torture » parce que « le gouvernement tient tous les demandeurs d'asile et tous les militants soudanais responsables de la décision de la CPI qui a lancé un mandat d'arrestation contre le président soudanais Omar Elbashir ». La lettre invoque aussi [traduction] « la situation actuelle au Soudan et l'arrestation illégale de militants et de citoyens des régions marginalisées ainsi que les mauvais traitements qui leur sont infligés ... ».
[68]
Selon l'agent, l'opinion de l'Association ne fournit pas [traduction] « un fondement objectif » qui confirme l'existence des risques qu'elle évoque. Je pense que cette affirmation n'est pas déraisonnable et ce, pour plusieurs motifs. D'abord, l'Association n'explique pas de quelle façon elle a pris connaissance de ces renseignements et ce qu'elle a fait pour effectuer le suivi de la situation. De plus, elle formule des hypothèses inspirées des expériences antérieures du demandeur, dont le compte rendu provient de toute évidence du demandeur, et qui ne tiennent pas compte des décisions défavorables de la SPR et de l'agent chargé de l'ERAR à l'égard du demandeur; c'est ce à quoi l'agent, à mon avis, fait allusion dans le passage suivant: « [L] a lettre ne fournit pas de renseignements sur la situation personnelle du demandeur au Soudan ... »
[69]
Il est clair que l'Association appuie le demandeur - qui est un de ses membres - et qu'elle accepte sa version de ce qu'il a vécu au Soudan.
[70]
En dernière analyse, je ne peux pas dire que l'agent a agi de façon déraisonnable en exigeant des éléments de preuve objectifs pour étayer l'assertion selon laquelle le gouvernement du Soudan [traduction] « tient tous les demandeurs d'asile et tous les militants soudanais responsables ... ».
[71]
En conclusion, je pense que le seul motif de contrôle que le demandeur a étayé est le défaut de l'agent d'évaluer raisonnablement toute l'ampleur de son établissement et le degré de difficulté susceptible de résulter de cet aspect du dossier du demandeur. Cependant, étant donné qu'il s'agissait d'un élément tellement important de sa demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, je pense que cette erreur rend la décision déraisonnable et que l'affaire doit faire l'objet d'un nouvel examen.
[72]
L'agent était tenu d'évaluer les éléments de preuve relatifs à l'établissement
personnel du demandeur
. Comme la juge Elizabeth Heneghan l'a souligné dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 13:
11 La demanderesse soutient que l'agent a omis de tenir compte de son degré d'établissement au Canada et a commis une erreur en concluant que son établissement n'était pas supérieur à ce qu'on pourrait s'attendre d'une personne qui vit au Canada sans statut depuis plusieurs années. L'agent a mentionné ce qui suit:
[traduction]
[...] son degré d'établissement ne dépasse pas le degré normal d'établissement auquel on s'attendrait de la part de demandeurs dans leur situation. Par conséquent, je conclus que l'établissement des demandeurs au Canada n'est pas d'un tel degré que l'obligation de présenter leur demande de résidence permanente de l'étranger constituerait une difficulté inhabituelle, injustifiée ou excessive.
[12] Sur le fondement des décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.), et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la demanderesse soutient que cette conclusion, tirée sans aucune analyse de sa situation particulière, est erronée. Dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Blais a mentionné ce qui suit au paragraphe 29:
[29] J'estime que la CI en est arrivée à une conclusion de fait qui n'est pas raisonnable: les conclusions de la CI selon laquelle « leur degré d'établissement n'est pas supérieur à celui auquel on peut s'attendre à l'égard d'un réfugié qui aurait eu les mêmes possibilités au Canada » et selon laquelle elle n'est pas convaincue que dans leur cas, « leur degré d'établissement est suffisamment différent ou important pour que l'on puisse dire que la famille Jamrich est mieux établie que toute autre famille qui réside au Canada en attendant que se déroule le processus de détermination du statut de réfugié » sont manifestement déraisonnables, compte tenu des circonstances de l'espèce.
[13] La décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> a été rendue en application de la Loi et du Guide de l'immigration: Traitement des demandes au Canada -5: Demande présentée par des immigrants au Canada pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire. Je ne vois aucun motif pour ne pas souscrire à l'approche prise par la Cour dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et je suis convaincue que la demanderesse a établi que l'agent avait commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle dans la façon dont il avait traité la question de l'établissement.
[73]
Les avocats conviennent qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier. La Cour est aussi de cet avis.
JUGEMENT
[74]
LA COUR ORDONNE
1. La demande est accueillie. La décision est annulée et l'affaire est renvoyée à un autre agent pour nouvel examen.
2. Il n'y a aucune question à certifier.

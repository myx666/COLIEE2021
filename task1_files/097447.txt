Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2014] F.T.R. TBEd. JA.020.
[1]
de Montigny, J.
: This is a motion, pursuant to s. 213 of the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106, and s. 18(1)(b) of the
Citizenship Act
, RSC 1985, c C-29 (the "
Citizenship Act
") for summary judgment on the Plaintiff's claim, issued January 18, 2012. In essence, the Minister seeks an order declaring that the Defendant obtained his Canadian citizenship by knowingly concealing material circumstances because he failed to advise a citizenship official that he was charged with an indictable offence prior to obtaining his Canadian citizenship. If the Minister is successful in the action, he will then be entitled, pursuant to s. 10(1) of the
Citizenship Act
, to make a report to the Governor in Council which, if accepted, will result in the Defendant ceasing to be a Canadian citizen.
[2]
In this motion, the Minister asks the Court to grant summary judgment and issue the declaration it seeks in the action, on the basis that there is no arguable issue for trial and that the action should not proceed further. Having carefully considered both the arguments submitted by the parties and the record, I have come to the conclusion that the Minister's motion for summary judgment must be granted.
Facts
[3]
The Defendant was born in Kingstown, St. Vincent and Grenadines, on October 4, 1982. He became a permanent resident of Canada on January 18, 2000.
[4]
The Defendant completed an adult application for Canadian citizenship on March 20, 2003. The citizenship application, consistent with the legislative provisions, contained a warning that Canadian citizenship shall not be granted while the applicant is charged with an indictable offence and that applicants must inform citizenship officials of pending charges for indictable offences. Section 11 of the application form reads as follows:
I agree to advise Citizenship and Immigration Canada if any information on this form changes before I take the Oath of Citizenship. I understand the contents of this form. I declare that the information provided is true, correct, and complete, and that the photographs enclosed are a true likeness of me. I understand that if I make a false declaration, or fail to disclose all information material to my application, I could lose my Canadian citizenship and be charged under the
Citizenship Act
.
I have indicated in Section 8 whether the prohibitions apply to me.
[5]
On June 6, 2003, less than three months after completing his citizenship application, the Defendant was charged with various indictable offences, including trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking, contrary to s. 5(1) of the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act,
SC 1996, c 19. The Defendant was further charged with trafficking on October 3, 2003.
[6]
On December 11, 2003, the Defendant was advised that his application was approved and invited to supply further information. On March 23 2004, the Defendant took the oath of citizenship and became a Canadian citizen, having declined to disclose the pending criminal charges against him. The oath the Defendant signed contains a confirmation that the Defendant has no pending charges. The Defendant was eventually convicted of trafficking in cocaine on November 12, 2004, after having entered a guilty plea on that charge; the other two charges against him were withdrawn at the request of the Crown.
[7]
On August 25, 2005, the Defendant was charged with unlawfully procuring Canadian citizenship by failing to disclose his pending charges for cocaine trafficking. On July 3, 2007, the Defendant was convicted of the offence with which he had been charged under the
Citizenship Act
, namely that he knowingly concealed a material circumstance, by failing to advise a Citizenship official that he was charged with an indictable offence prior to obtaining his Canadian Citizenship, contrary to paragraph 29(2)(a) of the
Citizenship Act
. He was also charged a victim surcharge of $1,000.
[8]
In his reasons released on November 20, 2007, the judge of the Ontario Court of Justice concluded that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant knowingly concealed material circumstances in order to procure Canadian citizenship. More specifically, he stated:
On all of the evidence, including Mr. Campbell's own evidence, I am not left with a doubt that Mr. Campbell knew that he was required to tell Citizenship and Immigration Canada about his criminal charges. From the day he was charged, until the day he swore his oath of citizenship, he knew he had an obligation to disclose this information to the proper authorities. For whatever reason, he failed to do so. I reject beyond a reasonable doubt the contention that Mr. Campbell was honestly mistaken about his obligations under the Act and how to fulfill them ...
Reasons for Judgment, at p 7. Exhibit "I" to the Affidavit of Paulette Haughton, Plaintiff's Motion Record, at p 51.
[9]
The Defendant was given notice in accordance with section 18 of the
Citizenship Act
of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration's intent to revoke his citizenship. The Notice was dated September 20, 2011. Consistent with the Defendant's request, the matter was then referred to the Federal Court pursuant to s. 18 of the
Citizenship Act
.
Issue
[10]
The only issue raised by this motion is whether summary judgement should be granted in favour of the Plaintiff. In other words, has the Plaintiff satisfied the Court that there is no genuine issue of fact or law for trial?
Analysis
[11]
No person who is charged with an indictable offence under any Act of Parliament may be granted citizenship or take the oath of citizenship:
Citizenship Act
, at paragraph 22(1)(b). Indeed, the notice to appear to take the oath of citizenship includes a warning that anyone charged with an offence under the
Criminal Code,
RSC 1985, c C-46, or other enactment is ineligible to take the oath of citizenship. The notice advises as well that anyone in this circumstance must inform the citizenship office. The Defendant was first notified that he met the requirements for citizenship on December 11, 2003 and was given a notice to appear to take the oath of citizenship on January 15, 2004. This notice, however, was returned undeliverable and a new notice was provided, with a new oath date of March 23, 2004. The Defendant claimed that the second notice did not contain the above-mentioned warning, but there is no evidence on the record to confirm the allegation. There is no reason to believe that the second notice would not have been similar to the first one and would not have contained the same warning, as it appears to be a standard form.
[12]
Where the Governor in Council, on a report from the Minister, is satisfied that any person has obtained, retained, renounced or resumed citizenship under the
Citizenship Act
by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances, the person ceases to be a citizen:
Citizenship Act
, paragraph 10(1)(a). Paragraph 18(1)(a) and (b) of the
Citizenship Act
reads as follows:
18. (1) The Minister shall not make a report under section 10 unless the Minister has given notice of his intention to do so to the person in respect of whom the report is to be made and
(a) that person does not, within thirty days after the day on which the notice is sent, request that the Minister refer the case to the Court; or
(b) that person does so request and the Court decides that the person has obtained, retained, renounced or resumed citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances.
18. (1) Le ministre ne peut procéder à l'établissement du rapport mentionné à l'article 10 sans avoir auparavant avisé l'intéressé de son intention en ce sens et sans que l'une ou l'autre des conditions suivantes ne se soit réalisée:
a) l'intéressé n'a pas, dans les trente jours suivant la date d'expédition de l'avis, demandé le renvoi de l'affaire devant la Cour;
b) la Cour, saisie de l'affaire, a décidé qu'il y avait eu fraude, fausse déclaration ou dissimulation intentionnelle de faits essentiels.
[13]
Therefore, the Court does not revoke citizenship. It only makes a declaration, which can enable the Governor in Council to do so at some subsequent time. It is important to note that the Defendant will be entitled to make submissions to the Governor in Council before his citizenship is revoked, and may also seek judicial review of such a decision.
[14]
When a party brings a motion for summary judgment, the Court must determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial with respect to a claim or defence. The purpose of summary judgment is to allow the Court to summarily dispense with cases which ought not to proceed to trial because there is no genuine issue to be tried. The test is not whether a party cannot possibly succeed at trial; rather, it is whether the case is so doubtful that it does not deserve consideration by the trier of fact at a future trial. As such, summary judgment is not restricted to the clearest of cases.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[15]
The record shows that the Defendant was charged, that he was warned about his duty to disclose charges, that he did not do so and proceeded to take the oath of citizenship. His defence does not dispute any of these facts. The Defendant claims, however, that he was not aware that he must inform Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) that he had been charged while his citizenship application was pending, and that in any event, the police would inform CIC if it impacted his citizenship application.
[16]
The Defendant's defence amounts to a collateral attack on a final decision of a criminal court of competent jurisdiction in an attempt to re-litigate an issue that has already been tried and is an abuse of process. The facts necessary for this Court to make the order the Plaintiff seeks have already been found on the criminal standard of proof, in the context of the proceedings against the Defendant in the Ontario courts. The Defendant has been convicted of the offence of knowingly concealing material circumstances in obtaining his citizenship. Evidence of a conviction for knowingly concealing material circumstances for the purpose of obtaining citizenship is proof in a reference proceeding, such as the case at bar.
[17]
The Ontario Court of Justice rejected the argument that Mr. Campbell discharged his obligation by cooperating with the arresting police officers, and his further claim that he had discharged his obligation by telling the police about his dealings with CIC. There is therefore no need to say more about these submissions. As for his (somewhat contradictory) submission that he was not aware of his obligation, it should have been made before the Ontario Court of Justice. The Defendant had the opportunity to challenge the charge of misrepresentation, he could have called witnesses and he could have argued that he did not "knowingly" conceal material circumstances. Yet, it appears from the reasons of the Ontario Court of Justice that "Mr. Campbell did not testify to any misunderstanding as to his obligations while his application for citizenship was pending" (Reasons, p 2; Plaintiff's Motion Record, p 46). This proceeding is not an appeal of the decision of the Ontario Court of Justice; once again, the Defendant cannot launch a collateral attack on a final decision of a provincial criminal court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[18]
The Defendant also complains about an alleged delay in the bringing of revocation proceedings. He submits that the Plaintiff became aware or ought to have become aware in August 2005 that the Defendant may have obtained the Canadian citizenship by failing to disclose his pending charges for cocaine trafficking, but did not issue its Notice in Respect of Revocation of Citizenship until September 2011. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's six years delay amounts to an abuse of process that is sufficient to stay the revocation proceedings.
[19]
Even assuming that the relevant time period for determining delay is the period between when the government became aware of the fraud and the issuance of the statement of claim, as opposed to the period between the notice of revocation being sent to the applicant and the date when the referral proceedings began as decided in a number of cases (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Tremblay-Lamer came to the conclusion that three factors have to be balanced in assessing the reasonableness of an administrative delay: (1) the time taken compared to the inherent time requirements of the matter; (2) the causes of the delay beyond the inherent requirements of the matter; and (3) the impact of the delay.
[20]
The case at bar was not a complex one and did not require further investigation. Moreover, the Minister offered no explanation for the delay in processing the revocation. These first two factors therefore weigh in favour of the Defendant. However, the Defendant has been unable to show that he was prejudiced by the delay. On the contrary, he has allegedly benefitted from the delay, however it is calculated, as he has lived with his Canadian spouse, has fathered a child and has been gainfully employed. Given the absence of evidence with respect to the impact of the delay on the Defendant, the damage to the public interest in the fairness of the administrative process should the proceeding go ahead would not exceed the harm to the public interest in the enforcement of the legislation if the proceedings were halted. I agree with the Minister that it would be perverse that the Defendant be permitted to continue to enjoy that which he fraudulently obtained, merely because he has so far enjoyed the ill-gotten citizenship for several years.
Conclusion
[21]
For all of the foregoing reasons, the Minister's motion is granted, and a declaration will issue pursuant to subsection 10(1) and paragraph 18(1)(b) of the
Citizenship Act
that the Defendant obtained Canadian citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances. There will be no costs, as the Minister provided no explanation for the delay in commencing this proceeding.
ORDER
[22]
THIS COURT ORDERS that
the Minister's motion for summary judgment is granted, without costs. The Court declares that Chibanbo Abonie Campbell obtained Canadian citizenship by false representation or fraud by knowingly concealing material circumstances.

Le Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  jugement sommaire, présentée en application de l'article 213 des
Règles des Cours fédérales
, DORS/98-106, et de l'alinéa 18(1)
b
) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
, LRC 1985, c C-29 (la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
), visant la déclaration délivrée par le demandeur le 18 janvier 2012. En substance, le ministre sollicite une ordonnance déclarant que le défendeur a acquis la citoyenneté canadienne en dissimulant de façon intentionnelle des faits essentiels, en ce qu'il n'a pas informé un agent de la citoyenneté qu'on l'avait inculpé d'un acte criminel avant l'acquisition de la citoyenneté. S'il obtient gain de cause, le ministre pourra soumettre un rapport au gouverneur en conseil, en application du paragraphe 10(1) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
, et l'acceptation du rapport par le gouverneur en conseil fera perdre sa citoyenneté canadienne au défendeur.
[2]
Par la présente requête, le ministre demande à la Cour de rendre un jugement sommaire en sa faveur, et de faire la déclaration qu'il sollicite dans le cadre de l'action, au motif qu'il n'y a pas de question sérieuse à instruire et qu'il n'y a pas lieu de poursuivre l'action. J'ai examiné avec soin tant les arguments des parties que le dossier, et je suis venu à la conclusion qu'il y a lieu d'accueillir la requête en jugement sommaire du ministre.
Faits pertinents
[3]
Le défendeur est né à Kingstown, à Saint-Vincent-et-les Grenadines, le 4 octobre 1982. Le 18 janvier 2000, il est devenu résident permanent du Canada.
[4]
Le 20 mars 2003, le défendeur a rempli une Demande de citoyenneté canadienne-Adultes. La demande de citoyenneté renfermait un avertissement précisant, en conformité avec les dispositions législatives pertinentes, que la citoyenneté canadienne ne serait pas accordée au demandeur accusé d'un acte criminel, et que les demandeurs devaient informer les agents de la citoyenneté s'ils étaient sous le coup d'une telle accusation. L'article 11 du formulaire de demande prévoit ce qui suit:
Si des renseignements que j'ai fournis dans le présent formulaire devaient être modifiés avant que je prête le serment de citoyenneté, je m'engage à en aviser Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada. Je comprends le contenu de ce formulaire et je déclare que les renseignements que j'ai fournis sont vrais, exacts et complets, et que les photographies jointes sont effectivement de moi. Je comprends que, si je fais une fausse déclaration ou si je ne divulgue pas tous les renseignements dans ma demande, je pourrais perdre la citoyenneté canadienne et faire face à des accusations en vertu de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
.
J'ai bien indiqué à la partie 8 si certaines des interdictions s'appliquent ou non à mon cas.
[5]
Le 6 juin 2003, soit moins de trois mois après avoir rempli sa demande de citoyenneté, le défendeur a été inculpé de divers actes criminels, y compris celui de trafic de cocaïne et de possession de cocaïne en vue d'en faire le trafic, des infractions visées au paragraphe 5(1) de la
Loi réglementant certaines drogues et autres substances
, LC 1996, c 19. Le 3 octobre 2003, le défendeur a encore une fois été accusé de trafic.
[6]
Le 11 décembre 2003, on a informé le défendeur que sa demande avait été approuvée, tout en le conviant à fournir des renseignements supplémentaires. Le 23 mars 2004, le défendeur a prêté le serment de citoyenneté et il est devenu citoyen canadien, sans toutefois avoir divulgué les accusations au pénal portées contre lui. En signant le formulaire de serment, le défendeur a confirmé qu'aucune accusation ne pesait contre lui. Le défendeur a finalement été reconnu coupable de trafic de cocaïne le 12 novembre 2004, après inscription d'un plaidoyer de culpabilité; à la demande de la Couronne, on a retiré les deux autres accusations dont le défendeur faisait l'objet.
[7]
Le 25 août 2005, le défendeur a été accusé d'avoir acquis illégalement la citoyenneté canadienne en ne divulguant pas les accusations de trafic de cocaïne portées contre lui. Le 3 juillet 2007, le défendeur a été reconnu coupable de l'infraction visée à l'alinéa 29(2)
a
) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
dont on l'avait inculpé, soit d'avoir dissimulé intentionnellement un fait essentiel, du fait qu'il n'avait informé aucun agent de la citoyenneté qu'on l'avait accusé d'un acte criminel avant qu'il n'ait acquis la citoyenneté canadienne. On a également infligé au défendeur une suramende compensatoire de 1 000 $.
[8]
Dans ses motifs rendus le 20 novembre 2007, le juge de la Cour de justice de l'Ontario a conclu qu'il était convaincu hors de tout doute raisonnable que le défendeur avait dissimulé intentionnellement des faits essentiels en vue d'acquérir la citoyenneté canadienne. Il a plus précisément déclaré ce qui suit:
[traduction] Après examen de l'ensemble de la preuve, y compris le témoignage de M. Campbell, je n'ai plus aucun doute que ce dernier savait qu'il devait informer Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada des accusations portées au pénal contre lui. M. Campbell savait qu'il devait divulguer de tels renseignements aux autorités compétentes à compter du jour où on l'a inculpé jusqu'à celui où il a prêté le serment de citoyenneté. Pour une raison quelconque, il ne l'a pas fait. Je conclus, hors de tout doute raisonnable, au rejet de la thèse de M. Campbell voulant qu'il ait commis une erreur de bonne foi au sujet des obligations que la Loi lui impose et de la manière dont il faut s'en acquitter [...]
Motifs du jugement, à la page 7. Pièce I jointe à l'affidavit de Paulette Haughton, dossier de requête du demandeur, à la page 51.
[9]
En conformité avec l'article 18 de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
, le ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration a informé le défendeur, par avis daté du 20 septembre 2011, de son intention de révoquer sa citoyenneté. L'affaire a ensuite été renvoyée devant la Cour fédérale, à la demande du défendeur, en application de l'article 18 de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
.
Question en litige
[10]
La seule question soulevée dans le cadre de la présente requête est de savoir si la Cour devrait rendre un jugement sommaire en faveur du demandeur. Autrement dit, le demandeur a-t-il convaincu la Cour de l'absence de toute véritable question de fait ou de droit à trancher?
Analyse
[11]
Nul ne peut recevoir la citoyenneté ni prêter le serment de citoyenneté tant qu'il est inculpé pour un acte criminel prévu par une loi fédérale (alinéa 22(1)
b
) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
). D'ailleurs, l'avis de convocation à la cérémonie pour prêter serment est accompagné d'un avertissement selon lequel quiconque est inculpé d'une infraction visée au
Code criminel
, LRC 1985, c C-46, ou à une autre loi, n'a pas le droit de prêter le serment de citoyenneté. L'avis fait également état de l'obligation pour toute personne dans une telle situation d'en informer le bureau de la citoyenneté. Le défendeur a d'abord été informé le 11 décembre 2003 qu'il satisfaisait aux conditions d'acquisition de la citoyenneté, puis on lui a donné avis le 15 janvier 2004 de se présenter pour prêter le serment de citoyenneté. L'avis a toutefois été retourné à l'expéditeur pour défaut de livraison; un nouvel avis a été envoyé, qui mentionnait le 23 mars 2004 comme nouvelle date de serment. Le défendeur a soutenu que l'avertissement mentionné plus haut ne figurait pas dans le deuxième avis, mais aucun élément de preuve au dossier ne confirme cette allégation. Il n'y a aucune raison de croire que le deuxième avis aurait pu différer du premier et ne pas renfermer le même avertissement, étant donné qu'il semble s'agir d'un formulaire standard.
[12]
L'intéressé perd la citoyenneté lorsque le gouverneur en conseil est convaincu, sur rapport du ministre, que l'acquisition, la conservation ou la répudiation de la citoyenneté, ou la réintégration dans celle-ci, est intervenue sous le régime de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
par fraude ou au moyen d'une fausse déclaration ou de la dissimulation intentionnelle de faits essentiels (alinéa 10(1)
a
)). Les alinéas 18(1)
a
) et
b
) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
disposant pour leur part que:
18. (1) Le ministre ne peut procéder à l'établissement du rapport mentionné à l'article 10 sans avoir auparavant avisé l'intéressé de son intention en ce sens et sans que l'une ou l'autre des conditions suivantes ne se soit réalisée:
a) l'intéressé n'a pas, dans les trente jours suivant la date d'expédition de l'avis, demandé le renvoi de l'affaire devant la Cour;
b) la Cour, saisie de l'affaire, a décidé qu'il y avait eu fraude, fausse déclaration ou dissimulation intentionnelle de faits essentiels.
18. (1) The Minister shall not make a report under section 10 unless the Minister has given notice of his intention to do so to the person in respect of whom the report is to be made and
(a) that person does not, within thirty days after the day on which the notice is sent, request that the Minister refer the case to the Court; or
(b) that person does so request and the Court decides that the person has obtained, retained, renounced or resumed citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances.
[13]
Il ne revient donc pas à la Cour de révoquer la citoyenneté. Elle se borne à faire une déclaration qui permettra au gouverneur en conseil de procéder à une telle révocation. Il importe aussi de noter qu'il sera loisible au défendeur de présenter des observations au gouverneur en conseil avant la révocation de sa citoyenneté, et, le cas échéant, de solliciter le contrôle judiciaire de la décision portant révocation.
[14]
Lorsqu'une partie présente une requête en jugement sommaire, la Cour doit établir si la déclaration ou la défense, selon le cas, soulève une véritable question litigieuse. Le jugement sommaire a pour but de permettre à la Cour de se prononcer par voie sommaire sur les affaires qu'elle n'estime pas nécessaire d'entendre parce qu'elles ne soulèvent aucune question sérieuse à instruire. Il ne s'agit pas de savoir si une partie n'a aucune chance d'obtenir gain de cause au procès, mais plutôt d'établir si le succès de la demande est tellement douteux que celle-ci ne mérite pas d'être examinée par le juge des faits dans le cadre d'un éventuel procès. Par conséquent, les jugements sommaires ne sont pas réservés aux affaires particulièrement claires (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 11;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[15]
En l'espèce, le dossier révèle que le défendeur a été inculpé et qu'on l'a informé de son obligation de communiquer ce fait, qu'il n'a pas respecté cette obligation et qu'il a néanmoins prêté le serment de citoyenneté. Le défendeur ne conteste aucun de ces faits dans sa défense. Il prétend toutefois qu'il ne savait pas qu'il devait informer Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (CIC) qu'on l'avait inculpé pendant que sa demande de citoyenneté était pendante et qu'en tout état de cause, il croyait que la police informerait CIC si cela devait avoir une incidence sur sa demande de citoyenneté.
[16]
La défense du défendeur équivaut à attaquer accessoirement la décision définitive d'une juridiction criminelle compétente en vue de plaider à nouveau une question déjà tranchée, ce qui constitue un abus de procédure. Les faits dont le demandeur doit faire la preuve pour que la Cour rende l'ordonnance qu'il sollicite ont déjà été jugés établis selon la norme criminelle de preuve, dans le cadre d'une procédure engagée contre le défendeur devant les cours de l'Ontario. Le défendeur a été reconnu coupable d'avoir commis l'infraction de dissimulation intentionnelle de faits essentiels dans le but d'acquérir la citoyenneté. La preuve d'une telle déclaration de culpabilité fait preuve dans le cadre d'une procédure relative à un renvoi, comme celle en l'espèce.
[17]
La Cour de justice de l'Ontario a rejeté l'argument voulant que M. Campbell se soit acquitté de son obligation en coopérant avec les policiers qui ont procédé à son arrestation, ou encore en informant la police de ses échanges avec CIC. Il n'est donc pas nécessaire de traiter plus longuement de cet argument. Quant à l'argument (quelque peu contradictoire) selon lequel M. Campbell n'était pas au fait de son obligation, ce dernier aurait plutôt dû le soumettre à la Cour de justice de l'Ontario. Le défendeur a eu l'occasion de contester l'accusation de fausse déclaration, il aurait pu appeler des témoins et il aurait pu faire valoir qu'il n'avait pas dissimulé « intentionnellement » des faits essentiels. Il semble au contraire, d'après les motifs du juge de la Cour de justice de l'Ontario, que [traduction] « M. Campbell n'a aucunement mentionné dans son témoignage qu'il ne comprenait pas quelles étaient ses obligations pendant que sa demande de citoyenneté était pendante » (motifs, page 2; dossier de requête du demandeur, page 46). Je ne suis pas saisi d'un appel de la décision de la Cour de justice de l'Ontario; je le répète, le défendeur ne peut attaquer accessoirement la décision définitive d'une juridiction criminelle provinciale (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 16).
[18]
Le défendeur se plaint également du retard à entamer la procédure de révocation. Selon le défendeur, le demandeur a appris ou aurait dû apprendre en août 2005 qu'il se pouvait qu'il ait acquis la citoyenneté canadienne en dissimulant les accusations de trafic de cocaïne portées contre lui, mais il n'a délivré qu'en septembre 2011 l'avis relatif à la révocation de sa citoyenneté. Le défendeur soutient que le retard de six ans imputable au demandeur équivaut à un abus de procédure suffisant pour justifier l'arrêt de la procédure de révocation.
[19]
Même à supposer que la période pertinente pour déterminer le caractère indu du retard est bien la période allant du moment où le gouvernement a eu connaissance de la fraude au moment de la délivrance de la déclaration, plutôt que celle allant de l'envoi de l'avis de révocation au demandeur à la date où a débuté la procédure de renvoi tel qu'il a été décidé à de nombreuses reprises (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la juge Tremblay-Lamer a conclu que, pour évaluer le caractère raisonnable d'un délai administratif, trois facteurs devaient être appréciés: (1) le temps écoulé par rapport au délai inhérent à l'affaire; (2) les causes de la prolongation du délai inhérent à l'affaire et (3) l'incidence du retard.
[20]
L'affaire qui nous occupe n'était guère complexe et n'exigeait pas une enquête plus approfondie. De plus, le ministre n'a expliqué d'aucune manière pourquoi on avait tardé à engager la procédure de révocation. Ces deux premiers facteurs penchent en faveur du défendeur. Celui-ci n'a pu toutefois démontrer que le retard lui avait causé préjudice. Il en aurait au contraire tiré parti, quel que soit son mode de calcul, dans la mesure où il a entretemps vécu avec son épouse canadienne, eu un enfant et occupé un emploi rémunéré. En l'absence de preuve quant à l'incidence du retard sur le défendeur, le préjudice qui serait causé à l'intérêt du public à l'équité du processus administratif si la procédure devait suivre son cours, n'excèderait pas celui qui serait causé à l'intérêt du public dans l'application de la loi, advenant l'arrêt de la procédure. J'estime comme le ministre qu'il serait injuste d'autoriser le défendeur à continuer de bénéficier de ce qu'il a obtenu par fraude, simplement parce qu'il a déjà tiré profit depuis plusieurs années de sa citoyenneté mal acquise.
Conclusion
[21]
Pour tous les motifs qui précèdent, la requête du ministre est accueillie, et jugement déclaratoire sera rendu, en application du paragraphe 10(1) et de l'alinéa 18(1)
b
) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
, portant que le défendeur a acquis la citoyenneté canadienne par fraude ou au moyen d'une fausse déclaration ou en dissimulant de façon intentionnelle des faits essentiels. Aucuns dépens ne seront adjugés, le ministre n'ayant pas expliqué pourquoi on avait tardé à engager la procédure en cause.
ORDONNANCE
[22]
LA COUR ORDONNE que
la requête en jugement sommaire du ministre soit accueillie, sans dépens. La Cour déclare que Chibanbo Abonie Campbell a acquis la citoyenneté canadienne par fraude ou au moyen d'une fausse déclaration par la dissimulation intentionnelle de faits essentiels.

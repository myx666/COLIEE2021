 I.  
 Introduction  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] 
   
 Shore, J. 
  [Translation]: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA), for judicial review of a decision by an immigration officer dated December 5, 2012, to reject an application for an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds under subsection 25(1) of the IRPA.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II.  
 Facts  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The applicant, Gladys Dorléan, is a Haitian citizen, born in Port-au-Prince, in 1945. She gave birth to a daughter, Marie Carmel Jean-Baptiste, in 1966. The applicant indicated that Marie Carmel Jean-Baptiste allegedly married Hatson Lafortune prior to 1994 in Haiti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Shortly after the marriage, Mr. Lafortune allegedly moved to Canada. He then allegedly applied to bring Ms. Jean-Baptiste to Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  In October 1994, Ms. Jean-Baptiste moved from Haiti to join Mr. Lafortune in Canada. She subsequently became pregnant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  On June 12, 1995, the applicant, Ms. Dorléan, came to Canada to attend the second marriage ceremony between her daughter and Ms. Lafortune, as well as to be present at the birth of her grandson. She received a temporary visa to participate in these two events expiring on November 30, 1995.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The applicant remained in Canada illegally until 2005.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  On July 12, 2005, the applicant made a refugee claim under the false name of "Évelyne Dorléan". The applicant explained that her son-in-law started this process for her and that she had no choice but to comply with his directions. The refugee claim was refused on January 6, 2006.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  On October 18, 2010, the applicant made an H&C application to apply for permanent residence from within Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  The H&C application was denied on December 5, 2012.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III.  
 Decision under review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  In his decision, the officer first noted that he did not have jurisdiction to assess factors based on a fear of risk, as set out in sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA. The officer stated that he did not therefore consider the applicant's reasons with respect to the socio-economic dynamics in Haiti, but rather assessed the hardship that she would personally face. The officer concluded that the risks detailed in the Applicant's Record were not personalized, and therefore, could not constitute an "unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  The officer then assessed the other factors identified by the applicant in support of her H&C application, namely, her degree of establishment in Canada and her ties to her homeland.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  In assessing the applicant's degree of establishment in Canada, the officer determined that the applicant did not demonstrate that she would have difficulty in meeting financial or emotional needs without the support and assistance of the family unit in Canada. The officer noted that the applicant has not lived with her family in Canada since 2005, and that she rather depended on social assistance to meet her financial needs. The officer also pointed out that the applicant has three brothers and two sisters in Haiti; thus, she would have some support in Haiti if she were forced to return to and apply for permanent residence from within Haiti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  As for her establishment, the officer also assigned significant weight to the fact that she has had illegal status in Canada since 2005. He also concluded that the applicant had not demonstrated a sufficiently substantial connection to Canada to result in "unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship" for her if she were to return to Haiti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  The officer also considered the best interests of the applicant's grandchildren, even though no such allegation was made by the applicant. However, he determined that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the negative impacts of the applicant's re-establishment in Haiti on her grandchildren would be significant enough to warrant an H&C application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 Issue  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Did the officer err in finding that the applicant would not face "unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship" if she had to apply for permanent residence from outside Canada?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V.  
 Relevant statutory provisions  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Section 25(1) of the IRPA is applicable in this case:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 25. (1) Subject to subsection (1.2), the Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who applies for permanent resident status and who is inadmissible - other than under section 34, 35 or 37 - or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada - other than a foreign national who is inadmissible under section 34, 35 or 37 - who applies for a permanent resident visa, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 25. (1) Sous réserve du paragraphe (1.2), le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada qui demande le statut de résident permanent et qui soit est interdit de territoire - sauf si c'est en raison d'un cas visé aux articles 34, 35 ou 37 -, soit ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant hors du Canada - sauf s'il est interdit de territoire au titre des articles 34, 35 ou 37 - qui demande un visa de résident permanent, étudier le cas de cet étranger; il peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des considérations d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger le justifient, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VI.  
 Standard of review  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  The findings of fact and refusal to grant the H&C application are assessed on the standard of reasonableness ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 18).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  When a decision is made on a standard of reasonableness, reasonableness requires "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 47;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VII.  
 Position of the parties  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  In oral argument, the applicant indicated that the officer committed two reviewable errors:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) The officer erred in his analysis of the facts by using conjectures about the applicant's family ties in Haiti and by failing to analyze central facts;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) The officer erred in his analysis of the hardship the applicant would face upon her return to Haiti by finding that she [Translation] "had to establish that the current conditions in Haiti would affect her personally".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  With respect to the first point, the respondent submits that the officer reasonably found that the applicant would be able to benefit from the support of family members in Haiti. The respondent states that the applicant bore the burden of demonstrating that she would not benefit from the support of her family in her country of origin, but that she remained silent on that point without taking the opposite position.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  The respondent also submits that the officer took into account the applicant's allegations in assessing the H&C application. The respondent adds, however, that the officer was under no obligation to accept all these explanations in his analysis ( 
 Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  With respect to the second point, the respondent submits that the officer did not err in his analysis, as he took into account all the facts. However, he decided not to accept all of the applicant's explanations. Furthermore, the respondent submits that the applicant's argument puts a premium on the merits of her application, and therefore, must be dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VIII.  
 Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Did the officer err in his analysis by using conjectures or failing to analyze facts?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  An H&C application is an exceptional and discretionary measure:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 15;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . To obtain such an exemption, the applicant must show that she would face "unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship" if she was required to apply for permanent residence from outside Canada ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  
 Unusual or undeserved 
  hardship is hardship that is unanticipated by the IRPA or  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations 
 , SOR/2002-227 ( 
 IRPR 
 ), which result from circumstances beyond her control. 
 Disproportionate 
  hardship results where the obligation to apply for permanent residence from outside Canada disproportionately impacts the applicant  
 given her personal circumstances 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  In this case, the Court is satisfied that the officer reasonably considered all the applicant's claims and did not ignore evidence, namely with respect to her family ties in Haiti. The applicant filed a large volume of objective documentation on sexual violence in Haiti, but very little evidence pertaining to her particular circumstances if she were to return to Haiti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  In her H&C application, the applicant indicated that she had three brothers and two sisters in Haiti, but did not provide any information on the nature of her relationship with her family members. The only reference to the nature of her relationship with them is found in the following sentence [Translation] : "She would then find herself in a country where she currently has no family ties that can meet her emotional needs" (application for a visa exemption on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, at paragraph 26).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  In her memorandum, the applicant reiterates this point and alleges that the officer erred because he presumed that [Translation] "the existence of siblings guarantees support to the applicant if she were to return to Haiti" (at paragraph 34). However, the applicant still does not provide any explanation as to why her family members would not be able to help to meet her financial or emotional needs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  The Court notes that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is under no duty to  
 highlight weaknesses 
  in an H&C application and to request further submissions( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 44-45;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 8-9).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  Thus, the burden was on the applicant to demonstrate that there were sufficient H&C grounds to grant her an exemption and to establish the facts on which her claim rested. She had acted at her own risk by omitting pertinent information in her written submissions on her family ties in Haiti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  In the absence of sufficient evidence on the record, the Court cannot fault the officer for not reaching a different conclusion with respect to the hardship the applicant claims she will face upon her return to Haiti. The only evidence in the record in this regard is that the applicant has a number of family members in Haiti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  Similarly, the Court cannot accept the applicant's claim that the officer erred in failing to analyze the reasons for her derogatory actions in her refugee claim. They do not bear any relation to the crux of the H&C application, which is based on the applicant's establishment in Canada and the socio-economic conditions in Haiti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  The Court notes that, when she filed her claim for refugee protection in 2005, the applicant had already been living in Canada illegally for ten years. The applicant's reasons for making a refugee claim under a false name at the time do not address her disrespect for and disregard of the law, which enabled her to establish herself in Canada in 1995. The Court considers that the officer reasonably assigned significant weight to this disrespect for and disregard of the law in determining the applicant's establishment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  However, the Court finds that even if those reasons had been "central" to the H&C application, as the applicant submits, such a failure would not be sufficient to set aside the officer's decision. The Court quotes from  
 Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union 
 , above, in which the Supreme Court of Canada stated as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Reasons may not include all the arguments, statutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details 
  the reviewing judge would have preferred, but that did not impugn the validity of either the reasons or the result under a reasonableness analysis.  
 If the reasons allowed the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permitted it to determine whether the conclusion was within the range of acceptable outcomes, the  
 Dunsmuir 
  criteria were met 
 . [Emphasis added.]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  The Court finds that the reasons provided by the officer make it possible to understand the basis for the officer's conclusion that the applicant's degree of establishmentin Canada would not cause an unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship upon her return to Haiti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Did the officer err in his analysis of the hardship caused by the conditions in Haiti?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  The officer considered the applicant's risk claims related to an eventual return to Haiti. The officer found that those claims were unfounded on the basis that the applicant failed to show that she would be personally affected by those risks.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  The case law of this Court has repeatedly confirmed that H&C applications must present a  
 particular 
 risk that is personalized to the applicant ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 224;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Court refers to the observations in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [38] The allegation of risks made in an H&C application must relate to a particular risk that is personal to the applicant.  
 The applicant has the burden of establishing a link between that evidence and his personal situation. Otherwise, every H&C application made by a national of a country with problems would have to be assessed positively, regardless of the individual's personal situation, and this is not the aim and objective of an H&C application 
 . That conclusion would be an error in the exercise of the discretion provided for in section 25 of the IRPA which is delegated to, inter alia, the PRRA officer by the Minister. . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [42] The question is not when or to where the applicant will be removed. The issue here is whether applying for a visa from outside Canada would cause the applicant unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.  
 The applicant has the burden of proving the particular facts of his personal situation, which mean that applying for a visa from outside Canada would cause him unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship 
 . . . . [Emphasis added.]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  There must necessarily be a link between evidence supporting generalized risk and that of personalized risk. Thus, the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate a link between the risk and her personal situation. Even if generalized risk could be proven in this case, this is not enough to succeed in an H&C claim (see  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  The Court finds that the evidence was weak, or even non-existent, regarding the applicant's personal risk in Haiti. The H&C application focused only on the socio-economic conditions in Haiti facing the general population on a daily basis. The officer therefore reasonably concluded that the applicant did not establish that her circumstances indicate personal risk.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [38] 
  The officer's decision, on the basis of the evidence, does not warrant the Court's intervention. These reasons fall within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. The onus was on the applicant to show the officer that sufficient H&C grounds existed to warrant an exemption from the requirements of the Act. However, the applicant failed to discharge this burden.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IX.  
 Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] 
  For all the foregoing reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 JUDGMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [40] 
  THE COURT ORDERS that the applicant's application for judicial review be dismissed with no question of general importance to certify.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Introduction  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] 
   
 Le juge Shore 
 : Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire fondée sur le paragraphe 72(1) de la  
 Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés 
 , LC 2001, c 27 [ 
 LIPR 
 ], visant la décision rendue par un agent d'immigration en date du 5 décembre 2012 de rejeter une demande de dispense pour considérations d'ordre humanitaire [demande CH] au sens du paragraphe 25(1) de la  
 LIPR 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 II.  
 Faits  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  La demanderesse, madame Gladys Dorléan, est citoyenne haïtienne, née à Port-au-Prince, en 1945. Elle a donné naissance à une fille, Marie Carmel Jean-Baptiste, en 1966. La demanderesse indique que cette dernière aurait épousé monsieur Hatson Lafortune avant 1994 à Haïti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  Peu de temps après ce mariage, monsieur Lafortune aurait déménagé au Canada. Il aurait ensuite fait une demande pour faire venir madame Jean-Baptiste.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  En octobre 1994, madame Jean-Baptiste s'est déplacée d'Haïti pour venir rejoindre monsieur Lafortune au Canada. Elle est ensuite tombée enceinte.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Le 12 juin 1995, la demanderesse, madame Dorléan, est arrivée au Canada pour assister à une deuxième cérémonie de mariage entre sa fille et monsieur Lafortune, ainsi que pour être présente à la naissance de son petit-fils. Elle a reçu un visa temporaire pour participer à ces deux événements, expirant le 30 novembre 1995.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  La demanderesse est restée au Canada illégalement jusqu'en 2005.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Le 12 juillet 2005, la demanderesse a présenté une demande d'asile sous le faux nom d'« Évelyne Dorléan ». La demanderesse explique que son gendre a entamé ces démarches pour elle et qu'elle n'avait pas le choix que de se soumettre aux directives de ce dernier. La demande d'asile a été refusée le 6 janvier 2006.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  Le 18 octobre 2010, la demanderesse a présenté une demande CH afin de pouvoir demander la résidence permanente de l'intérieur du Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  La demande CH fut rejetée le 5 décembre 2012.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 III.  
 Décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle judiciaire  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Dans sa décision, l'agent a d'abord fait remarquer qu'il n'était pas compétent pour évaluer les facteurs fondés sur la crainte d'être exposé à des risques, suivant les articles 96 et 97 de la  
 LIPR 
 . L'agent a précisé qu'il n'avait donc pas considéré les motifs de la demanderesse en ce qui avait trait aux dynamiques socio-économiques en Haïti, mais qu'il avait plutôt évalué les difficultés auxquelles elle serait exposée personnellement. L'agent a conclu que les risques détaillés dans le dossier de la demanderesse n'étaient pas personnalisés, et donc, ne pouvaient pas constituer une « difficulté inhabituelle et injustifiée ou excessive ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  L'agent a ensuite évalué les autres facteurs relevés par la demanderesse à l'appui de sa demande CH, à savoir son degré d'établissement au Canada et ses liens avec son pays d'origine.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  En évaluant le degré de l'établissement de la demanderesse au Canada, l'agent a statué que la demanderesse n'avait pas démontré qu'elle aurait des difficultés à subvenir à ses besoins financiers ou affectifs sans le soutien de sa famille au Canada. L'agent a souligné que la demanderesse n'a pas vécu avec sa famille au Canada depuis 2005, et qu'elle dépendait plutôt de l'aide sociale pour subvenir à ses besoins financiers. L'agent a aussi fait remarquer que la demanderesse a 3 frères et 2 sœurs en Haïti; donc, elle aurait un certain soutien en Haïti si elle serait obligée de retourner et formuler sa demande de résidence permanente à partir d'Haïti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  En ce qui a trait à son établissement, l'agent a aussi accordé un poids important au fait que son statut au Canada n'est pas légal depuis 2005. Il a également conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas créé des liens suffisamment importants au Canada pour donner lieu à une « difficulté inhabituelle et injustifiée ou excessive » pour elle advenant son retour en Haïti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  L'agent a aussi pris en considération l'intérêt supérieur des petits-enfants de la demanderesse; même si elle n'avait fait aucune allégation à cet égard. Cependant, il a déterminé qu'il n'y avait pas assez de preuve pour conclure que le rétablissement de la demanderesse à Haïti aurait des répercussions nuisibles suffisamment importantes sur ses petits-enfants pour justifier une demande CH.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IV.  
 Point en litige  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  L'agent a-t-il erré en concluant que la demanderesse ne subirait pas de « difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives » si elle devait demander la résidence permanente de l'extérieur du Canada?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 V.  
 Dispositions législatives pertinentes  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  L'article 25(1) de la  
 LIPR 
  s'applique en l'espèce:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 25. (1) Sous réserve du paragraphe (1.2), le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant au Canada qui demande le statut de résident permanent et qui soit est interdit de territoire - sauf si c'est en raison d'un cas visé aux articles 34, 35 ou 37 -, soit ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, sur demande d'un étranger se trouvant hors du Canada - sauf s'il est interdit de territoire au titre des articles 34, 35 ou 37 - qui demande un visa de résident permanent, étudier le cas de cet étranger; il peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des considérations d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger le justifient, compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 25. (1) Subject to subsection (1.2), the Minister must, on request of a foreign national in Canada who applies for permanent resident status and who is inadmissible - other than under section 34, 35 or 37 - or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on request of a foreign national outside Canada - other than a foreign national who is inadmissible under section 34, 35 or 37 - who applies for a permanent resident visa, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VI.  
 Norme de contrôle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Les conclusions de fait et le refus de faire droit à une demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire sont appréciés selon la norme de la décision raisonnable ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au para 18).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  Lorsqu'une décision est rendue sous la norme de la décision raisonnable, cela nécessite « la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au para 47;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VII.  
 Position des parties  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  Selon sa plaidoirie, la demanderesse fait valoir que l'agent a commis deux erreurs susceptibles de contrôle:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 a) L'agent a commis une erreur dans son analyse des faits en utilisant une conjecture par rapport aux liens familiaux de la demanderesse à Haïti et en omettant d'analyser des faits centraux;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 b) L'agent a commis une erreur dans son analyse concernant les difficultés auxquelles la demanderesse serait exposée à son retour en Haïti en concluant qu'elle « devait établir que les conditions actuelles en Haïti l'affecteraient personnellement ».  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  Quant au premier point, le défendeur affirme que l'agent a raisonnablement conclu que la demanderesse pourrait bénéficier d'un certain soutien des membres de sa famille en Haïti. Le défendeur postule que c'était à la demanderesse de démontrer qu'elle ne bénéficierait d'aucun soutien de sa famille dans son pays d'origine, mais qu'elle est restée silencieuse sur ce point sans avoir soulevé le contraire.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  Le défendeur soutient également que l'agent a tenu compte de toutes les allégations de la demanderesse dans son évaluation de la demande CH. Le défendeur ajoute, néanmoins, que l'agent n'avait toutefois pas l'obligation de retenir toutes ces explications dans son analyse ( 
 Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  Quant au deuxième point, le défendeur soutient que l'agent n'a pas commis d'erreur dans son analyse, car il a tenu compte de tous les faits. Il a toutefois décidé de ne pas retenir toutes les explications de la demanderesse. De plus, le défendeur prétend que l'argument de la demanderesse privilégie le fond de sa demande, et donc doit être rejeté.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 VIII.  
 Analyse  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 L'agent a-t-il erré dans son analyse en utilisant des conjectures ou en omettant d'analyser des faits?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Une demande CH est une mesure exceptionnelle et discrétionnaire:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au para 15;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Pour obtenir une telle dispense, la demanderesse doit prouver qu'elle subirait « des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives » si elle était tenue de demander la résidence permanente de l'extérieur du Canada ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Une difficulté  
 inhabituelle ou injustifiée 
  est une difficulté qui n'est pas prévue par la  
 LIPR 
  ou par le  
 Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés 
 , DORS/2002-227 [ 
 RIPR 
 ] et qui résulte de circonstances échappant de son contrôle. Une difficulté  
 excessive 
  résulte où l'obligation de demander la résidence permanente de l'extérieur du Canada entraînerait des répercussions disproportionnées pour la demanderesse,  
 compte tenu des circonstances qui lui sont propres 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  En l'espèce, la Cour est satisfaite que l'agent a raisonnablement tenu compte de toutes les prétentions de la demanderesse et n'a pas ignoré des éléments de la preuve, notamment en ce qui concerne ses liens familiaux en Haïti. La demanderesse a déposé une quantité volumineuse de documentation objective sur la violence sexuelle à Haïti, mais très peu de preuve à l'égard de sa situation particulière advenant son retour en Haïti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Dans sa demande CH, la demanderesse a indiqué qu'elle avait 3 frères et 2 sœurs en Haïti, mais elle n'a fourni aucun renseignement sur la nature de sa relation avec les membres de sa famille. La seule allusion à la nature de sa relation avec eux se retrouve dans la phrase suivante: « Elle se retrouverait alors à retourner dans un pays où elle ne bénéficie aujourd'hui d'aucun lien familial qui puisse répondre à ses besoins émotifs » (Soumission pour une demande d'exemption de visa pour considérations humanitaires au para 26).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  Dans son mémoire, la demanderesse réitère ce point et allègue que l'agent a erré, car il a présumé que « l'existence d'une fratrie garantie à la demandeure un soutien advenant son retour en Haïti » (au para 34). Pourtant, la demanderesse ne fournit encore aucune explication quant à savoir pourquoi les membres de sa famille ne pourraient pas l'aider à subvenir à ses besoins affectifs ou financiers.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  La Cour rappelle que le Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration n'est pas tenu de  
 relever les lacunes 
  dans une demande CH, ni de réclamer d'autres observations que celles qui découlent de la demande ( 
 Kisana 
 , ci-dessus, aux para 44-45;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  aux para 8-9).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  Ainsi, il incombait à la demanderesse de démontrer qu'il existait des raisons d'ordre humanitaire suffisantes pour justifier sa demande de dispense et de présenter les faits sur lesquels sa demande reposait. C'était à ses risques d'omettre des renseignements pertinents dans ses observations écrites au sujet de ses liens familiaux en Haïti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  En raison de l'insuffisance de la preuve versée au dossier, la Cour ne peut reprocher à l'agent de ne pas avoir tiré une conclusion différente relativement aux difficultés auxquelles la demanderesse prétend qu'elle serait exposée à son retour en Haïti. La seule preuve au dossier à ce sujet indique que la demanderesse a de nombreux membres de famille en Haïti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  De même, la Cour ne peut pas accepter la prétention de la demanderesse que l'agent a erré en omettant d'analyser les motifs expliquant ses agissements dérogatoires dans sa demande d'asile. Ceux-ci ne touchent aucunement le nœud de la demande CH, qui est fondé sur l'établissement de la demanderesse au Canada et les conditions socio-économiques en Haïti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  La Cour remarque que, lors de sa demande d'asile en 2005, la demanderesse vivait déjà au Canada illégalement, et ce, depuis 10 ans. Les motifs pour lesquels la demanderesse aurait présenté une demande d'asile sous un faux nom à ce moment n'adressent pas son non-respect de la loi, qui lui a permis de s'établir au Canada depuis 1995. La Cour estime que l'agent a raisonnablement accordé un poids important à ce non-respect de la loi en déterminant l'établissement de la demanderesse.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  Or, la Cour statue que même si ces motifs avaient été « centraux » à la demande CH, comme le prétend la demanderesse, une telle omission ne permettrait pas à elle seule de casser la décision de l'agent. La Cour tient à citer l'extrait de l'arrêt  
 Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union 
 , ci-dessus, où la Cour suprême du Canada a énoncé:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Il n'est  
 pas nécessaire que les motifs fassent référence à tous les arguments ou détails 
  que le juge siégeant en révision aurait voulu y lire, mais cela ne met pas en doute leur validité ni celle du résultat.  
 S'ils permettent à la cour de révision de comprendre le fondement de la décision du tribunal et de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables, les motifs répondent alors aux critères établis dans  
 Dunsmuir 
 . [La Cour souligne.]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [33] 
  La Cour juge que les motifs donnés par l'agent permettent de comprendre sur quoi l'agent s'est fondé pour conclure que le degré d'établissement de la demanderesse au Canada ne causerait pas de difficultés inhabituelles, injustifiées ou excessives à son retour en Haïti.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 L'agent a-t-il erré dans son analyse de difficultés causées par les conditions en Haïti?  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  L'agent a examiné les allégations soulevées par la demanderesse concernant les risques auxquels cette dernière ferait face si elle retournait en Haïti. L'agent a conclu que ces allégations n'étaient pas fondées parce que la demanderesse n'avait pas démontré qu'elle serait personnellement affectée par ces risques.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  La jurisprudence de cette Cour a confirmé à maintes reprises que les demandes CH doivent faire état d'un certain risque personnalisé concernant un demandeur  
 en particulier 
  ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 224;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). La Cour rappelle les observations dans  
 Lalane 
 , ci-dessus:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [38] L'allégation des risques au sein d'une demande CH doit être un risque particulier et personnel au demandeur.  
 Le demandeur a le fardeau de démontrer un lien entre cette preuve et sa situation personnelle. Autrement, chaque ressortissant d'un pays en difficulté devrait recevoir une évaluation positive de sa demande CH, peu importe sa situation personnelle en cause, ce qui n'est pas le but et l'objectif d'une demande CH 
 . En conclure ainsi constituerait une erreur à l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire prévu à l'article 25 de la  
 LIPR 
  et délégué notamment à l'agent d'ERAR par le Ministre [...].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [...]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [42] La question n'est pas de savoir quand, ni où le demandeur sera renvoyé. La question en cause est de déterminer si le fait de demander un visa de l'extérieur du Canada causerait au demandeur des difficultés injustifiées et inhabituelles ou excessives.  
 C'est le demandeur qui a le fardeau de démontrer des faits particuliers à sa propre situation, lesquels font en sorte que le fait de demander un visa de l'extérieur du Canada représenterait pour lui une difficulté inhabituelle et injustifiée ou excessive 
 . [...]. [La Cour souligne.]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  Il doit nécessairement y avoir un lien entre les preuves corroborant le risque généralisé et celles concernant le risque devenu personnalisé. Il revient donc au demandeur de démontrer un lien entre le risque et sa situation personnelle. Même si un risque généralisé pouvait être prouvé dans le présent cas, cela ne serait pas assez pour obtenir une réponse favorable à la demande  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] 1RCF 232;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [37] 
  La Cour estime qu'il y avait une preuve mince, voire inexistante, concernant les risques personnels de la demanderesse en Haïti. La demande CH était concentrée uniquement sur les conditions socio-économiques en Haïti auxquelles la population générale doit faire face quotidiennement. L'agent a donc conclu de manière raisonnable que la demanderesse n'avait pas réussi à prouver que sa situation comportait un risque personnalisé.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [38] 
  La décision de l'agent, au vu de la preuve, ne justifie pas l'intervention de la Cour. Ces motifs appartiennent aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Il incombait à la demanderesse de démontrer à l'agent qu'il existait des raisons d'ordre humanitaire suffisantes pour justifier une dispense des obligations de la loi. Or, la demanderesse n'a pas réussi à s'acquitter de ce fardeau.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 IX.  
 Conclusion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [39] 
  Pour toutes les raisons ci-dessus, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 JUGEMENT  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [40] 
  LA COUR ORDONNE le rejet de la demande de contrôle judiciaire de la demanderesse avec aucune question d'importance générale à certifier.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

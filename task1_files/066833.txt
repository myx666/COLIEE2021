 Summary: 
 
 The plaintiffs were Canadian farmers who borrowed money from the Farm Credit Corp, subsequently fell into arrears on their pay­ments and were dissatisfied with the settle­ment options offered them by the Corp. The plaintiffs instituted a class action against the Farm Credit Corp., the Farm Debt Review Board and the Honourable W. McKnight (the defendants), seeking to force the Corp. and the Board to provide the farmers with a list of the rules, regulations and policies which governed the Corp. in its dealings with clients and a list detailing, inter alia, the conditions and criteria by which the Corp. could obtain funds from the Farm Debt Review Fund. The plaintiffs then applied for an interlocutory injunction re­straining the Corp. from auctioning, selling or realizing upon its security until it pro­vided the lists. The defendants applied to strike out the plaintiffs' statement of claim, alleging that the court lacked jurisdiction to deal with the claim. Further, the defendants applied to have McKnight struck as a party to the action.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Divi­sion, allowed the defendants' application to strike out the plaintiffs' statement of claim and dismissed the plaintiffs' interlocutory injunction application as well as the plain­tiffs' action. The court also struck out Mc­Knight as a party.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 The Facts:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] 
   
 Denault, J. 
 : The plaintiffs in this action are Canadian farmers who borrowed money from the Farm Credit Corporation (hereinafter "F.C.C."), subsequently fell into arrears on their payments, and were dissatisfied with the settlement options offered to them by the F.C.C. Although each plaintiff's fact situation is different, they are generally alleging that they were treated unfairly and dealt with in an inconsistent fashion by the F.C.C. during negotiations regarding their outstanding loans. They claim that during the course of these negotiations, F.C.C. representatives led them to believe that the only option available to such financially distressed farmers, other than a buy out, was the voluntary transfer of the title to their mortgaged farm lands, with a lease back of the same, in satisfaction of their debt.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Action:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The plaintiffs have instituted a class action against the F.C.C., the Farm Debt Review Board (hereinafter "F.D.R.B.") and the Honourable William McKnight in an effort to force the F.C.C. and the F.D.R.B. to promulgate and provide to F.C.C.'s financially distressed clients, a list of the rules, regulations, and policies which govern the F.C.C. in its dealings with its clients in financial difficulty, as well as a second list outlining the rules, regulations and policies detailing the manner, conditions and criteria by which the F.C.C. may obtain funds from the Farm Debt Review Fund (hereinafter "F.D.R.B. Fund"). They are also seeking a number of injunctive and declaratory forms of relief which relate to these lists.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Motions:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  By way of motion before this court, the plaintiffs are seeking an interlocutory injunction against the defendant F.C.C. More specifically, the plaintiffs are requesting an order restraining the F.C.C. from auctioning, selling or realizing upon its security, acquiring lands by voluntary transfer, or disposing of lands that it presently holds, until it has promulgated and provided to all its borrowers in financial difficulty, essentially the same lists sought in the principle action against the defendants.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  The defendants have presented a motion to strike the plaintiffs' statement of claim in its entirety on the grounds that it discloses no reasonable cause of action. They submit that this court lacks jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the plaintiffs in their action against the defendants. They further seek to have the Honourable William McKnight struck as a party to this action.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  I will deal with these two motions concurrently as the same principles of law are at issue. Before proceeding to a discussion involving this court's jurisdiction to entertain these matters, I wish to comment on some preliminary considerations involving form.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Matters Relating To Form:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Minister Of Agriculture:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  The plaintiffs have named the Honourable William McKnight as a defendant in this action. A Minister of the Crown cannot be sued in his representative capacity, nor can he be sued in his personal capacity unless the allegations against him relate to acts done in his personal capacity ( 
 Re Air India 
  (1987), 62 O.R.(2d) 130; 44 D.L.R.(4th) 317 (Ont. H.C.)). As the plaintiffs have made no claims against the Minister relating to actions done in his personal capacity, the Honourable William McKnight must be struck as a party to the action.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Requirements For A Class Action:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Can the plaintiffs' action, as it is framed, properly form the subject-matter of a class action within the meaning of rule 1711 of the  
 Federal Court Rules 
 ? Paragraph (1) of rule 1711 reads as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Rule 1711(1) Where numerous persons have the same interest in any proceeding, the proceeding may be begun, and, unless the court otherwise orders, continued, by or against any one or more of them as representing all or as representing all except one or more of them. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [8] 
  The plaintiffs' statement of claim describes the proposed class of plaintiffs to this action as including all "farmers, borrowers from the F.C.C. who have been, are or may be in financial difficulty".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  For a matter to be appropriate for the institution of a class action, the persons in the class must have a common interest and a common grievance. Furthermore, the relief sought must in its nature be beneficial to all members of the class, or as it has sometimes been described, "if the plaintiffs win, all win" ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  
 Kiist and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  Rule 1711 requires that the plaintiffs and those they seek to represent have the "same interest" in the proceedings. In the case of  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada interpreted this term to mean that the plaintiffs must all have the  
 same interest in the outcome of the judgment 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  In the present case, the plaintiffs are currently at greatly varying stages in their dealings with the F.C.C. Several plaintiffs have voluntarily transferred their farms to the F.C.C. and are operating under a lease-back arrangement; whereas others are still attempting to negotiate a settlement agreement. While some plaintiffs have seen their farm lands sold to a third party, others face the execution of a final provincial court order for the judicial sale of their property. As a result, the individual members of the class have varying interests in obtaining the lists of rules, regulations and policies described in the statement of claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  Many of the plaintiffs are certainly hoping to find, in these lists, an undivulged option which would allow them to keep their land. However, those who face final provincial court orders or whose lands have already been sold can receive no "practical" benefit from the distribution of these lists. This may explain why the plaintiffs are also seeking additional forms of relief such as "an order declaring voidable all transfers of land to the F.C.C. from farmers, by way of transfer or legal action, prior to the production of the [lists]" and "an order to prohibit the F.C.C. from selling any land which it now holds and which was obtained ... by way of legal action or transfer until 60 days after [the distribution of the lists]". Unfortunately, the purpose of a class action is not to allow a group of plaintiffs to seek numerous forms of relief in an attempt to satisfy the varying needs of all of its members. It is the opinion of this court that, in order to satisfy the requirement of having "the same interest in the outcome of the judgment", the relief sought by a class of plaintiffs must, at the very least, have a practical impact on each of the members of the class.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  For the above reasons, the plaintiffs cannot be permitted to pursue their action as it is currently framed since it does not properly form the subject-matter of a class action within the meaning of rule 1711.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  Since this action may not proceed as a class action, any reference to the "plaintiffs' motion" shall be directed at the motion presented solely by William Cairns, Patricia Cairns and Eagleton Dairies Limited (as it was in fact constructed).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Jurisdiction:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  One of the issues to be determined in this matter is whether this court has the jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs' motion for injunction and the principal action against the defendants.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  Section 18 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  confers on this court an exclusive review jurisdiction over federal boards, commissions or other tribunal by the prerogative and extraordinary remedies outlined in the section. Section 18 reads as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "18. The Trial Division has exclusive original jurisdiction  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (a) to issue an injunction, writ of certiorari, writ of prohibition, writ of mandamus or writ of quo warranto, or grant declaratory relief, against any federal board, commission or other tribunal; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (b) to hear and determine any application or other proceeding for relief in the nature of relief contemplated by paragraph (a), including any proceeding brought against the Attorney General of Canada, to obtain relief against a federal board, commission or other tribunal. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 The expression "federal board, commission or other tribunal" is defined in s. 2(g) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "2. In this Act,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 'federal board, commission or other tribunal' means any body or any person or persons having, exercising or purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament, other than any such body constituted or established by or under a law of a province or any such person or persons appointed under or in accordance with a law of a province or under s. 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [17] 
  Therefore, this court must determine whether the F.C.C. and the F.D.R.B. are "federal boards, commissions or other tribunals" upon which this court,  
 in these circumstances 
 , has jurisdiction.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  The F.C.C. is a corporation which was established pursuant to s. 3(1) of the  
 Farm Credit Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-2. The F.C.C. is also an agent of the Crown and is listed in Part I of Schedule III to the  
 Financial Administration Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-11, which lists parent Crown corporations which are wholly owned by the federal Crown.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  The F.C.C. makes, administers and supervises farm loans under the  
 Farm Credit Act 
  and the  
 Farm Syndicates Credit Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-5. F.C.C.'s role is to provide mortgage credit and complementary financial services to Canadian farmers on a break-even basis. F.C.C. loan products, interest rates and risk parameters are developed on a national basis. However, since it is felt that the regional offices are better suited to take into account local conditions, the strength of the market for the farm product, as well as the impact of provincial legislation on lending operations, loan decisions and debt settlements are normally made at the local level.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  In order to advance a loan, the F.C.C. must be satisfied that a farmer has significant potential for commercial viability ( 
 Farm Credit Act 
 , s. 25). If the F.C.C. declines a loan or approves a lesser amount than that which was applied for, a farmer may have his loan application reviewed by an appeal board established pursuant to F.C.C. bylaws. Recommendations made by the appeal board are not binding on the F.C.C.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  F.C.C. accounts which are in arrears are also dealt with at the local level. The F.C.C. has the power to enter into compositions or arrangements, grant extensions of time, substitute security and renegotiate mortgages or other agreements ( 
 Farm Credit Act 
 , s. 11). If negotiations between the F.C.C. and the borrower to deal with arrears are unsuccessful, the assistance of the F.D.R.B. may be sought.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  The  
 Farm Debt Review Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-2.3 establishes an F.D.R.B. for each province or region of Canada. The  
 Farm Debt Review Act 
  allows both "farmers in financial difficulty" and "insolvent farmers" to apply to the F.D.R.B. for a review of their financial affairs or for assistance in facilitating arrangements with their creditors. Insolvent farmers may apply to the F.D.R.B. for a stay of any proceedings by their creditors. However, apart from this limited power, the F.D.R.B. has no decision making or enforcement authority.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  Privy Council Minute P.C. 1986-1/2914, issued on December 18, 1986, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and the Treasury Board pursuant to s. 5(2) of the  
 Department of Agriculture Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. A-9, established what has come to be known as the F.D.R.B. Fund. The Privy Council Minute (and its subsequent amended versions) provides that concessions granted to eligible farmers in financial difficulty, through the F.D.R.B. negotiation process, will be reimbursed to the F.C.C. by Agriculture Canada. Schedules A and B to the Privy Council Minute set out the terms, conditions and principles governing the F.C.C.'s participation in this reimbursement arrangement, as well as the types of assistance that the F.C.C. may provide. Specifically, the F.C.C. is authorized to provide the following forms of assistance to its eligible farm clients:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 a) postponement of payments to the end of the mortgage contract;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 b) refinancing with other F.C.C. loans i.e., regular loans, shared-risk mortgages and C.B.L. loans;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 c) reamortization of loans (including arrears);  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 d) loans for debt consolidation;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 e) leases of up to five years;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 f) debt set asides, defined as stopping future interest accrual on a portion of debt for a period of time;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 g) forgiving interest in arrears;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 h) sale-back of building sites to exiting farmers;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 i) stopping the accrual of interest to allow for a reasonable period of time to sell assets for exiting farmers; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 j) other methods resulting from Farm Debt Review Board hearings.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  As I understand it, this list of options is among the information which the plaintiffs wish to have distributed to all of the F.C.C.'s financially distressed farm clients. Unfortunately, the plaintiffs appear to have misunderstood the method used to access this Fund. In order to do so, the F.C.C. must be convinced either of the future viability of the farming operation or that a farmer is in need of assistance in order to preserve his equity while he phases out of farming operations. In either case, the F.C.C. must ensure that any concession granted, through the F.D.R.B. process, is made  
 on a sound commercial basis 
 . The F.D.R.B. Fund is  
 not 
  directly accessible by the farmers themselves and the determination of a farmer/borrower's eligibility for a particular concession is to be made by the F.C.C.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  Under s. 18 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , Parliament granted exclusive jurisdiction on the Trial Division of the Federal Court to provide the type of injunctive and declaratory relief sought by the plaintiffs. However, in order to obtain relief under s. 18, the defendants against whom such relief is sought must come within the definition of a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" set out in s. 2(g) of the  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.)). Although in principle, both the F.C.C. and the F.D.R.B. are bodies which exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by an Act of Parliament and, therefore, appear to fall under the Federal Court's jurisdiction, the court must examine the particular circumstances of a case before making such a determination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  In the case of  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), MacKinnon, J.A., writing for a unanimous Ontario Court of Appeal, held that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, a body which exercises powers conferred by an Act of Parliament, is not a "federal board, commission or other tribunal", within the meaning of s. 2(g) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , when it is carrying on the business of broadcasting. The court established that a corporate entity carrying on its  
 business 
  purpose and having, in such circumstances, none of the attributes of a federal board, commission or tribunal, does not fall within the definition set out in s. 2(g).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Thurlow, A.C.J. (as he then was), examined the Federal Court's jurisdiction in light of an application for an injunction against the C.B.C. In that decision, Mr. Justice Thurlow held that the expression contained in s. 2(g) does not include the private powers exercisable by an ordinary corporation created under a federal statute which are merely incidents of its legal personality or its authorized business.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  This interpretation was later applied by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), and by Rouleau, J., in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Admin. L.R. 231 (F.C.T.D.). In the latter case, Rouleau, J., was called upon to consider whether the Canada Council, as a public body created by an Act of Parliament and distributing government funds, should be subject to a duty of fairness to the potential recipients of these funds. In arriving at the conclusion that the Federal Court did not have jurisdiction as the Canada Council was not a "board, commission or other tribunal" within the meaning of s. 2(g) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , my brother Rouleau (at pp. 237-238 Admin. L.R.) considered factors such as the absence of government control over the Council's allocation of funds and the absolute discretion granted to the Council in developing its own standards and procedures in order to carry out its mandate. He also added that "creation by government and distribution of public funds is not by itself determinative".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  Decisions regarding the most commercially sound compromise arrangement to be reached with a client or the most appropriate remedy to be exercised against a borrower whose loan payments are in arrears are made by the F.C.C. in the course of its authorized business, that is, commercial lending. In such circumstances, the F.C.C. has none of the attributes of a "federal board, commission or tribunal", as all commercial lenders are required to make precisely these determinations. The government in no way controls the criteria to be used by the F.C.C. in determining who should benefit from specific compromise arrangements or concessions. In addition, the  
 Farm Credit Act 
  grants absolute discretion to the F.C.C. in developing its own standards in order to carry out its mandate (see specifically ss. 11, 20, 25, 34 and 40).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  The plaintiffs are asking this court to review the private powers of the F.C.C. which are incidents of its authorized business of commercial lending. Following the  
 Wilcox 
  decision, this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain either the plaintiffs' present motion or its principal action against the defendants since, in these circumstances, the F.C.C. does not fall within the definition of a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" contained in s. 2(g) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  With respect to the F.D.R.B., the circumstances surrounding its involvement in these matters also make it impossible to characterize this organization as a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" falling within the scope of s. 2(g). The F.D.R.B. has no access to or control over the F.D.R.B. Fund. It exercises no authority over decisions made by the F.C.C. In fact, other than its authority to extend or terminate a stay of proceedings by creditors pursuant to ss. 26 and 29 of the  
 F.D.R.B. Act 
  (which is not at issue here), the F.D.R.B. has no decision-making power whatsoever. With regards to its involvement with the plaintiffs in this case, the F.D.R.B. was only called upon to mediate negotiations between the F.C.C. and its financially distressed farm clients. In my opinion, a board, which acts only as a mediator and which has no decision-making authority, is not a "board, commission or other tribunal" within the meaning of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 . Accordingly, this court also lacks jurisdiction to entertain an application for relief against the F.D.R.B.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Conclusion:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  Although rule 401 was intended to deal with questions involving the court's jurisdiction and rule 419(1)(a) was meant to deal with whether there exists a reasonable cause of action assuming that the matter falls within the court's jurisdiction, a failure to set forth the correct rule does not defeat the substance of the motion ( 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As this court does not have the jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the plaintiffs in these circumstances, I must grant the defendants' motion to strike, and dismiss the plaintiffs' motion as well as its action against the defendants, with costs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Order accordingly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

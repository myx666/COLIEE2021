INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC- 2001, c 27 (Act) for judicial review of the decision of an Immigration Officer at the Immigration Section, High Commission of Canada in Nairobi, Kenya (Officer), dated 16 December 2011 (Decision), which refused the Applicant's application for permanent residence as a member of the Country of Asylum Class or Convention Refugee Abroad Class.
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicant is a 31-year-old citizen of Somalia. She left Somalia in 2007 and went to Kenya. From there she made an application to come to Canada along with her half-brother, Abdiqani, and another female relative, Faduma.
[3]
The Applicant was first interviewed in Nairobi on 18 April 2011. During this interview, she indicated that her reason for fleeing Somalia was that her father had been killed after he refused to join the armed militant group Al-Shabab. She also said that she left Kenya with Abdiqani, Faduma and some others, including a cousin. The visa officer (Officer ANX) who conducted this interview concluded that a preliminary positive decision was made pending receipt of identification.
[4]
Directly after interviewing the Applicant, Officer ANX interviewed Faduma. Faduma told Officer ANX that she left Kenya alone in 2006, that the Applicant was her aunt, that the Applicant's father (her grandfather) died before 1991, that she had not heard of the Applicant having any problems in Somalia and that she (Faduma) had nothing to fear if she returned there. After this interview, Officer ANX noted concerns about inconsistencies between the Applicant's and Faduma's descriptions of events, and noted that the Applicant should be called in for a second interview for reasons of procedural fairness.
[5]
On 8 August 2011, Abdiqani was interviewed by another immigration officer (Officer OMY). He said that after the death of their father, he, the Applicant and another sister decided to leave Somalia. Officer OMY noted that this was not consistent with what the Applicant said. While noting that there were consistencies between the Applicant's and Abdiqani's accounts of why they fled Somalia, Officer OMY believed a second interview was necessary to address credibility concerns.
[6]
The Applicant was called on 9 November 2011 to schedule another interview, which was conducted by the deciding Officer on 24 November 2011. The contents of the interviews with Faduma and Abdiqani were not disclosed to her prior to this second interview. When asked how Faduma was related to her, the Applicant replied that her father and Faduma's mother were related, but she did not indicate how. Regarding Faduma's claim that the Applicant's father was Faduma's grandfather, the Applicant replied "I don't know about that." The Applicant said that her father died in August 2007, and that she first met Faduma after arriving in Kenya. She also said that she arrived in Kenya with Abdiqani and another cousin. The Applicant was told that Abdiqani had said that another sister had accompanied them and she replied that no, that sister was still in Somalia. The Officer also relayed his concern that the Applicant had been in Kenya for four years without identification documents, and she responded that she never went out and did not travel.
[7]
The Officer did not think the Applicant was credible and so refused her application on 16 December 2011.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[8]
The Decision in this case consists of the refusal letter dated 16 December 2011, as well as the notes on the Applicant's file in the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS Notes).
[9]
As part of this proceeding, the Applicant also sought access to the CAIPS Notes from the interviews of Faduma and Abdiqani (the Rule 9 request), which was opposed by the Respondent. These notes were ordered disclosed by Prothonotary Lafrenière on 22 August 2012. While they do not form part of the Decision, they are part of the record in this proceeding.
[10]
In the CAIPS Notes dated 18 April 2011, Officer ANX wrote that the Applicant stated that Faduma was a distant relative, but Faduma said that the Applicant was her aunt. Officer ANX noted that the interview with Faduma raised several credibility concerns.
[11]
The Notes from the second interview conducted by the Officer on 23 March 2011 state that the Applicant said her father was related to Faduma's mother, whom she did not know. The Applicant said that she left Somalia with Abdiqani and a cousin, Shakur.
[12]
The Officer then asked the Applicant why she left Somalia and she replied that "my father was in the market and was killed." The Officer asked what happened, and the Applicant replied that "my father was killed and I decided to leave." According to the Officer, the Applicant was "leaning back, arms crossed, not volunteering more information." The Officer asked if the Applicant was at home when her father was killed, but she did not reply. He then asked the Applicant why she decided to leave, and she said that her father was killed and the shop in which she and Abdiqani worked was also attacked. She said a bomb fell on the shop and destroyed it, so she no longer had her father or her shop.
[13]
The Officer asked the Applicant why her father was killed and she replied that the Al Shabab wanted her father and brother to join them but they refused. She said that the group threatened her several times and told her that she would be killed if she did not join them, and that she would only be allowed her shop if she joined them. When she refused, her shop was destroyed.
[14]
The Applicant explained that her relative Hassan in Canada filled out her application form and that she knew some of the things in the application. The Officer relayed his concerns to the Applicant that the application said that her father and his children were ordered to carry out missions as human bombers, and that when the Applicant was interviewed in April 2011 she stated that she did not have any problems with Al-Shabab. The Applicant's response is recorded in the Notes as follows:
The biggest problem that I have had with Al Shabab is that they have killed my brother. The rest of the story about the shop is true. I was told that I had to join. The story I told in April is also true. When I finished my interview in April I was waiting for the medical. I don't know why I am here. My case is clear. I have many problems with Al Shabab, they have caused the death of my father.
[15]
The Officer noted that this response did not alleviate his concerns. The Officer explained to the Applicant that at the first interview she said she did not have any problems with Al-Shabab and did not mention any threats against her or bombing of the shop, but the application said they wanted her to be a human bomber, and she said in the second interview that the group bombed her shop. These were contradictions and the Officer could not be sure which account was true. The Applicant replied "what I've told you is true," but this did not alleviate the Officer's concerns.
[16]
The Officer then told the Applicant that Faduma had said that the Applicant's father had died many years before 2007. The Applicant replied that she was with her father when he died in 2007, and that she had only met Faduma in Kenya. The Officer noted that this did not alleviate any credibility concerns because the Applicant said in her first interview that she came to Kenya with Faduma. The Officer told the Applicant his concern that she said she came to Kenya with Faduma in the first interview, and the Applicant replied that it was a relative of her father that introduced her to Faduma.
[17]
The Officer also told the Applicant that Abdiqani had said he came to Kenya with the Applicant and another sister. The Applicant replied that no, that sister remained in Somalia. The Officer's credibility concerns remained due to inconsistencies between the different accounts. He also noted that the application said the Applicant arrived in Kenya on 1 September 2007, but Abdiqani told UNHCR that he arrived on 29 August 2007. Faduma said that she arrived alone in 2006.
[18]
The Officer relayed the concern to the Applicant that it was not plausible that she remained in Kenya for four years without any identification documents. The Applicant replied that she never went out, stayed indoors and did not travel because she did not have any identification documents, but the Officer did not find this explanation satisfactory. The Officer also noted that the Applicant did not answer when he asked her how her mother remained safely in Somalia.
[19]
After the interview, the Notes refer to the problems with the Applicant's credibility. First, there was inconsistency in the Applicant's own testimony about what happened to her and her father at the hands of Al-Shabab. Second, the Applicant did not provide sufficient detail about the threats made against her, and when asked for clarification she provided contradictory answers. Third, there was significant inconsistency between what the Applicant, Abdiqani and Faduma said about the death of the Applicant's father, and the relationship between the Applicant and Faduma and their arrival in Kenya. Fourth, when given opportunities to clarify the Applicant did not provide satisfactory answers. Thus, the Officer was not satisfied as to the Applicant's credibility.
[20]
In the Refusal Letter, the Officer noted that the Applicant's account of her persecution differed significantly between her application and her interviews, that she provided vague responses about the threats made against her in Somalia, and there were several inconsistencies between her interview and Abdiqani's that raised doubts regarding her flight from Somalia. As a result, the Officer did not think there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Applicant possessed a well-founded fear of persecution and the application was refused.
ISSUES
[21]
The Applicant raises the following issue in this application:
a. Was the duty of fairness owed to the Applicant breached by failing to disclose to her the substance of the interviews of Faduma and Abdiqani, and providing her with a chance to respond?
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[22]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis.
[23]
In
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Supreme Court of Canada held at paragraph 100 that it "is for the courts, not the Minister, to provide the legal answer to procedural fairness questions." Further, the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> held that the "procedural fairness element is reviewed as a question of law. No deference is due. The decision-maker has either complied with the content of the duty of fairness appropriate for the particular circumstances, or has breached this duty." The standard of review applicable to the issue raised by the Applicant is correctness.

ARGUMENTS
The Applicant
[26]
The Applicant points out that Faduma said in her interview that she was not afraid of anything in Somalia, and she did not know about the Applicant having any problems there. However, the concern that Faduma came to Kenya solely for the purpose of being sponsored to come to Canada was never put to the Applicant. In fact, the Applicant had to bring a motion before this Court in order to see the contents of the CAIPS Notes from the interviews with Faduma and Abdiqani.
[27]
Bits and pieces of the interview with Faduma were disclosed to the Applicant, but the Applicant says much of the substance of the interview was not disclosed. The Applicant submits that she should have been told that:
• Faduma said she came to Kenya solely because she had a sponsorship to Canada under way;
• Faduma said there were no problematic events in Somalia that caused her to flee;
• Faduma said that she did not fill out her application forms and that the application forms (which were filled out by the same sponsor as the Applicant) did not reflect any real events;
• Faduma said she did not think the Applicant had any problems in Somalia, because she would have heard about it if she did;
• Faduma said the family lived in Galkayo, a relatively safe place in Somalia.
The Applicant submits that these statements made by Faduma were highly prejudicial to her, yet they were not disclosed to her. The Applicant also did not know what was said in Abdiqani's interview.
[28]
The Applicant submits that the failure of the Officer to disclose to her the content of the other interviews is equivalent to the non-disclosure of a "poison pen letter". The jurisprudence says that the content of such letters must be disclosed and the failure to do so violates the
audi alteram partem
rule (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In this case, Faduma's statements that were most prejudicial to the Applicant were never disclosed to her.
[29]
Furthermore, the Applicant says that she was told at the end of her first interview that a positive decision had been made and she was waiting on the issuance of medical instructions. She was also counselled about the transportation loan and repayment. Although this communication may not have given the Applicant a right to a positive decision, it did increase the duty of fairness owed to her (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 26). As is evident from the CAIPS Notes, the Applicant was confused as to why she was required to attend a second interview.
[30]
The fact that this Court ordered the Notes of the interviews with Faduma and Abdiqani be disclosed to the Applicant must mean that they are relevant to her case, the Applicant argues. As the Applicant did not know the content of those interviews she was in no position to respond to the concerns raised by them. The Applicant should have been given full disclosure, but in this case the disclosure was only partial. As such, the duty of fairness was breached.
The Respondent
[31]
The Respondent submits that the duty of fairness owed to the Applicant was not breached. First, no negative inference can be drawn from the Respondent's response to the Rule 9 request. Prothonotary Lafrenière concluded that the decision letter and accompanying CAIPS Notes from the Applicant's file clearly reflect the reasons for the rejection of her application, and that complete reasons were provided to the Applicant. Second, at the Applicant's second interview she was clearly asked about all the concerns raised by the interviews with Faduma and Abdiqani, and given the opportunity to respond to each concern.
[32]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Court said that:
The content of the duty of fairness is variable and contextual. The discharge of a visa officer's duty of fairness must be assessed on a case by case basis. The jurisprudence is quite clear that the duty of fairness is not breached if the applicant had an opportunity to respond to the concerns raised in the visa officer's mind.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[33]
During the second interview the Applicant was asked detailed questions on the particular areas which were of concern to the Officer. The Officer directly put to the Applicant the information provided by Faduma and Abdiqani, and the Applicant provided answers to the Officer's questions that were either vague or contradicted her relatives' answers.
[34]
Furthermore, while the Applicant says she was not given an opportunity to address concerns raised by Abdiqani's second interview, since it took place after her own second interview, the reasons of the Officer make no mention of Abdiqani's second interview. They refer only to inconsistencies raised during his first interview. Therefore, this was not a breach of the duty of fairness.
[35]
The Respondent submits that all of the Officer's concerns were put to the Applicant, and she had an opportunity to respond. The Applicant failed to alleviate those concerns, and so the Officer reasonably denied her application and there was no breach of the duty of fairness.
The Applicant's Reply
[36]
The Applicant says that the Officer's real concerns - that the Applicant came from a safe part of Somalia, there was no event that caused the Applicant to flee Somalia, the Applicant did not fill out her own forms and the content of those forms did not reflect real events - were not directly put to the Applicant. A reading of the Applicant's second interview makes this apparent, and the Respondent does not contend otherwise.
[37]
The Applicant states that in the case of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited by the Respondent, the CAIPS Notes reflect that the concerns had been put to the applicant. In this case, there is no such reflection in the CAIPS Notes of the second interview with the Applicant. There is a difference between concerns and questions, and the fact that the Officer asked her further questions is not the same thing as notifying her of his concerns. Without the Applicant being informed about what happened in the interview with Faduma, these questions lacked context. As is evident from the CAIPS Notes, the Applicant was confused as to why she was being interviewed for a second time.
[38]
While the Respondent says the content of the interview with Faduma was put to the Applicant, the Applicant was never told of Faduma's statements. The Applicant should have had an opportunity to make submissions to the Officer to the extent that what Faduma said was untrue, but she never had that opportunity.
ANALYSIS
[39]
The Applicant raises procedural fairness as an issue but fails to address the substance of the Decision.
[40]
The claim was rejected because of credibility concerns which the Applicant failed to address and clarify when she was given the opportunity to do so.
[41]
As the Decision makes clear, the credibility problems were as follows:
(a) There was a lack of internal consistency in the information which the Applicant provided. At the interview in April 2011, the Applicant said that she did not have any problems with the Al-Shabab Militia but at the second interview she said she was told that if she did not join the Militia she would be killed. She also said at the second interview that she was told by the Militia she could only have the shop if she joined them and that, when she refused, the shop was destroyed.
This is a finding regarding internal inconsistencies in the Applicant's own evidence which she does not question. Hence, it stands as a reasonable finding. The Applicant now complains that it was procedurally unfair for the Officer not to disclose to her the substance of the interviews conducted with Faduma and Abdiqani, but she does not explain how this failure to disclose could possibly have affected the inconsistencies in her own evidence that were put to her and which she failed to explain;
(b) The second credibility concern was the Applicant's failure to provide sufficient detail or specificity regarding the threats made against her. She provided vague answers and, when asked for clarification, she provided contradictory answers.
Once again, this credibility finding relates to problems with the Applicant's own evidence which she does not dispute in this application. Hence, it stands as a reasonable finding. And once again, the Applicant fails to explain how a failure to disclose the substance of interviews with Faduma and Abdiqani has any bearing upon problems identified in the Applicant's own evidence that were squarely placed before her and which she could not, or would not, explain;
(c) The third basis for the negative credibility finding was the observation of significant inconsistencies "among statements made by [the Applicant], her half-brother and Faduma at interview." The officer states specifically what these significant inconsistencies are:
(i) Faduma said that the Applicant's father had died when she was a child, many years before 2007. The Applicant had said that she was with her father when he died in 2007;
(ii) Faduma said that the Applicant was her aunt and that they had been in touch and had known each other in Somalia. The Applicant said at the first interview that she and Faduma came to Nairobi together, but at the second interview she said that she met Faduma in Nairobi. Once again this is an internal inconsistency in the Applicant's own evidence which she failed to explain when the issue was put to her and which she has not questioned in this application;
(iii) At the first interview the Applicant said that she came to Kenya with Abdiqani, her half-brother, a cousin, and Faduma. In her separate interview, Faduma said that she had come alone to Kenya in 2006. This is an inconsistency between the evidence of separate witnesses, but it is an inconsistency that was squarely put to the Applicant and which she could not explain;
(iv) In his separate interview, Abdiqani said that he had come to Kenya with the Applicant and a sister called Istahil. The Applicant, however, said this was not the case because Istahil is still in Somalia.
[42]
The inconsistencies on these specific points were all put to the Applicant and she could not explain them. This led the Officer to conclude, reasonably, that "[t]here is a lack of clarity on family composition, dates of arrival and date of father's death among these three linked cases."
[43]
The Applicant says that she was prejudiced because the whole of Faduma's interview was not disclosed to her and Faduma said many things that were detrimental to the Applicant's refugee claim to which she was given no opportunity to respond. As the Decision shows, however, the Officer's credibility concerns were not based upon everything that Faduma said. They were based upon inconsistencies in the Applicant's own evidence, and specific inconsistencies between what the Applicant said and what Faduma and Abdiqani said which were put to the Applicant and which she could not explain.
[44]
The Applicant says that what happened in this case was equivalent to a failure to disclose a poison pen letter (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above) and that Faduma's statements that were most prejudicial to her were never disclosed. I disagree with this analogy.
[45]
The Officer does not use the whole of Faduma's evidence as the basis for his Decision. His Decision is based upon inconsistencies in the Applicant's own evidence and only specific inconsistencies between the Applicant, Faduma and Abdiqani's accounts, all of which were put to the Applicant and which she could not explain. There was no need to place everything that Faduma said before the Applicant because the Decision is not based upon all of the inconsistencies between what Faduma, Abdiqani and the Applicant said. The specific inconsistencies between what the claimants said only meant that there was a "lack of clarity on family composition, date of arrival and date of father's death among the three linked cases." The other problems were related to inconsistencies in the Applicant's own evidence.
[46]
The sole issue raised by the Applicant is that there were other concerns that arose out of Faduma's interview that were not identified to her so that she could respond. The suggestion is that these other concerns would have been material to the Officer's Decision and would have influenced the Officer's general assessment of the Applicant's evidence. In other words, the assertion is that the Decision was based, at least in part, upon the fact that Faduma had said in her interview that:
a) She had come to Somalia solely because she had a sponsorship to Canada under way;
b) There was no problematic event that caused her to flee;
c) She did not fill out her forms and what was in the forms, which were filled out by the same sponsor as the Applicant, did not reflect real events;
d) She didn't think that the Applicant had any problems because she would have heard if the applicant had any problems;
e) The family lived in Galkayo, a relatively safe place in Somalia,
[47]
The Applicant says that these statements by Faduma were highly prejudicial to her but were not disclosed and put to her.
[48]
This remains a bald assertion. There is no evidence before me that the Decision was based upon anything more than the concerns stated in the CAIPS Notes. The CAIPS Notes state the concerns that were identified following the interviews with Faduma and Abdiqani. Each of these concerns was then specifically and systematically put to the Applicant and she provided a response. There was no need to put everything that Faduma had said before the Applicant in order to determine that there were important discrepancies in their respective narratives that the Applicant could not resolve.
[49]
The Applicant's argument amounts to a claim that the Officer failed to disclose extrinsic evidence, defined by Justice Rothstein in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at paragraph 23 as "evidence of which the applicant has no knowledge and on which the immigration officer intends to rely in making the decision affecting the applicant". It is well established that an immigration officer must disclose extrinsic information upon which they intend to rely in coming to their decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA)), including information gathered through separate interviews of persons connected with the claim ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). However, there is no obligation to disclose information that is not relied upon:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[50]
The Applicant is asking the Court to infer that the Decision was based upon factors that are not identified in the reasons. There are no grounds to support such an inference. The record is clear on the basis for the Decision and the reasons why the Officer could not accept the Applicant's claim. In the absence of evidence that an immigration officer has relied upon undisclosed information in coming to their decision, the Court should not impute irregular motives or conduct: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 27. The Applicant does not argue that the Decision was unreasonable based upon what the CAIPS Notes reveal.
[51]
Courts must of course be alive to the possibility that information in the hands of a decision maker but not referenced in the reasons given for a decision could nonetheless influence that decision. However, in my view, that concern does not arise in this case. There were several discrepancies between the Applicant's account and that of Faduma and Abdiqani. The fact that the Officer chose to rely upon and confront with Applicant with some of those contradictions and not others does not undermine the fairness of the Decision. As Justice Rothstein explained in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 26, the reason claimants must be advised of concerns arising from contradictory information provided in their absence is that "denying the opportunity to respond invites a decision being made by an immigration officer on the basis of innocent discrepancies or a misunderstanding." The Officer in this case took steps to ensure this did not occur, by conducting a second interview and confronting the Applicant with their concerns. That is all that was required: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 10. The Officer was entitled to conclude that the Applicant's explanations were inadequate: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 26-27.
[52]
I can find nothing procedurally unfair or unreasonable about this Decision.
[53]
Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[54]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application is dismissed.
2. There is no question for certification.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Russell
[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), de la décision d'un agent d'immigration de la Section de l'immigration, Haut-commissariat du Canada à Nairobi, au Kenya (l'agent), en date du 16 décembre 2011 (la décision), qui rejetait la demande de résidence permanente de la demanderesse à titre de membre de la catégorie des personnes de pays d'accueil ou de membre de la catégorie des réfugiés au sens de la Convention outre-frontières.
FAITS ET PROCÉDURES
[2]
La demanderesse est une citoyenne de la Somalie âgée de 31 ans. Elle a quitté la Somalie en 2007 pour se rendre au Kenya. De là, elle a fait une demande pour venir au Canada avec son demi-frère, Abdiqani, et un membre de la famille de sexe féminin, Faduma.
[3]
La demanderesse a passé une première entrevue à Nairobi le 18 avril 2011. Au cours de cette entrevue, elle a déclaré avoir fui la Somalie parce que son père avait été tué après avoir refusé de rallier le groupe militant armé Al-Shabab. Elle a en outre affirmé avoir quitté le Kenya avec Abdiqani, Faduma et quelques autres personnes, dont un cousin. L'agent des visas (l'agent ANX) qui a mené cette entrevue a rendu une décision préliminaire favorable en attente de l'identification.
[4]
Immédiatement après avoir rencontré la demanderesse, l'agent ANX a fait passer une entrevue à Faduma au cours de laquelle elle a dit qu'elle avait quitté le Kenya seule en 2006, que la demanderesse est sa tante, que le père de la demanderesse (son grand-père) est décédé avant 1991, qu'elle n'avait pas entendu parlé du fait que la demanderesse éprouvait des problèmes en Somalie et qu'elle (Faduma) n'avait rien à craindre si elle y retournait. Après cette entrevue, l'agent ANX a noté ses préoccupations quant aux incohérences entre la description que la demanderesse a faite des événements et celle donnée par Faduma, en précisant que la demanderesse devrait être convoquée pour une deuxième entrevue pour des motifs d'équité procédurale.
[5]
Le 8 août 2011, Abdiqani a été interviewé par un autre agent d'immigration (l'agent OMY). Il a déclaré qu'après la mort de leur père, lui, la demanderesse et une autre sœur ont décidé de quitter la Somalie. L'agent OMY a noté que cette affirmation ne correspondait pas à ce qu'avait déclaré la demanderesse. Bien qu'il ait relevé des similitudes entre le récit de la demanderesse et celui d'Abdiqani quant aux motifs invoqués pour fuir la Somalie, l'agent OMY a estimé qu'une deuxième entrevue était nécessaire pour examiner la question de la crédibilité.
[6]
On a communiqué avec la demanderesse le 9 novembre 2011 pour fixer la date d'une autre entrevue, que l'agent décideur a effectuée le 24 novembre 2011. La teneur des entrevues avec Faduma et Abdiqani ne lui a pas été révélée avant cette deuxième entrevue. Lorsqu'on lui a demandé quels étaient ses liens familiaux avec Faduma, la demanderesse a répondu que son père et la mère de Faduma étaient parents, sans préciser la nature de ce lien familial. En ce qui concerne l'affirmation de Faduma selon laquelle le père de la demanderesse était son grand-père, la demanderesse a répondu: [traduction] « Je ne sais pas. » La demanderesse a déclaré que son père est mort en août 2007 et que sa première rencontre avec Faduma a eu lieu après son arrivée au Kenya. Elle a également affirmé être arrivée au Kenya avec Abdiqani et un autre cousin. On a informé la demanderesse qu'Abdiqani affirmait qu'une autre sœur les avait accompagnés, ce à quoi la demanderesse a répondu que ce n'était pas le cas et précisé que cette sœur était encore en Somalie. L'agent a également fait part de ses doutes quant au fait que la demanderesse serait demeurée au Kenya pendant quatre ans sans documents d'identité. La défenderesse a répondu qu'elle ne sortait jamais et qu'elle ne voyageait pas.
[7]
L'agent n'a pas jugé la demanderesse crédible et a donc refusé sa demande le 16 décembre 2011.
LA DÉCISION VISÉE PAR LA DEMANDE DE CONTRÔLE
[8]
La décision en l'espèce consiste en la lettre de refus datée du 16 décembre 2011 et les notes au dossier de la demanderesse dans le Système de traitement informatisé de dossiers d'immigration (STIDI).
[9]
Dans le cadre de la procédure dont la Cour est saisie, la demanderesse a également demandé l'accès aux notes du STIDI relatives aux entrevues avec Faduma et Abdiqani (la demande en vertu de l'article 9 des Règles), demande qui a été contestée par le défendeur. Le protonotaire Lafrenière a ordonné la communication de ces notes le 22 août 2012. Bien qu'elles ne fassent pas partie de la décision, elles font partie du dossier de la présente affaire.
[10]
Dans les notes du STIDI en date du 18 avril 2011, l'agent ANX indique que la demanderesse a déclaré que Faduma était une membre de sa famille éloignée, tandis que Faduma a déclaré que la demanderesse était sa tante. L'agent ANX a noté que l'entrevue avec Faduma avait soulevé des doutes au sujet de la crédibilité des récits.
[11]
Les notes de la deuxième entrevue, réalisée le 23 mars 2011, indiquent que la demanderesse a affirmé que son père était parent avec la mère de Faduma, qu'elle ne connaissait pas. La demanderesse a dit avoir quitté la Somalie avec Abdiqani et un cousin, Shakur.
[12]
L'agent a alors demandé à la demanderesse pourquoi elle avait quitté la Somalie, ce à quoi elle a répondu que son [traduction] « père était au marché quand il a été tué ». L'agent lui a demandé ce qui s'était passé, et la demanderesse a répondu que son [traduction] « père a été tué et j'ai décidé de partir ». L'agent a relevé que la demanderesse était [traduction] « penchée vers l'arrière, les bras croisés, et ne donnait pas plus de renseignements ». L'agent a demandé à la demanderesse si elle était à la maison lorsque son père a été tué, mais elle n'a pas répondu. Il lui a ensuite demandé pourquoi elle avait décidé de partir, ce à quoi elle a répondu que son père avait été tué et que la boutique dans laquelle elle et Abdiqani travaillaient avait également été la cible d'une attaque. Elle a affirmé qu'une bombe était tombée sur la boutique et l'avait détruite, de sorte qu'elle avait perdu son père ainsi que la boutique.
[13]
Quand l'agent lui a demandé pourquoi son père avait été tué, la demanderesse a répondu que les Al-Shabab voulaient que son père et son frère joignent leurs rangs, mais qu'ils ont refusé. Elle a affirmé que le groupe lui avait fait des menaces à plusieurs reprises, lui disant qu'elle serait tuée si elle ne joignait pas ses rangs, et qu'elle ne pourrait ravoir sa boutique que si elle se joignait au groupe. Quand elle a refusé, sa boutique a été détruite.
[14]
La demanderesse a expliqué qu'Hassan, un membre de sa famille au Canada, avait rempli son formulaire de demande et qu'elle était au fait de certaines des choses inscrites dans celle-ci. L'agent a fait part à la demanderesse de ses préoccupations quant au fait que la demande indique que son père et ses enfants ont reçu l'ordre de commettre des missions d'attentat-suicide à la bombe, alors qu'elle avait déclaré en avril 2011 n'avoir aucun problème avec le groupe Al-Shabab. La réponse de la demanderesse a été consignée comme suit dans les notes:
[traduction] Le plus gros problème que j'ai eu avec les Al-Shabab, c'est qu'ils ont tué mon frère. Le reste de l'histoire à propos de la boutique est vrai. Ils m'ont dit que je devais joindre leurs rangs. L'histoire que j'ai racontée en avril est aussi vraie. Quand j'ai terminé mon entrevue en avril, j'attendais l'examen médical. Je ne sais pas pourquoi je suis ici. Mon dossier est clair. J'ai beaucoup de problèmes avec les Al-Shabab, qui ont causé la mort de mon père.
[15]
L'agent a fait remarquer que cette réponse n'avait pas dissipé ses inquiétudes. L'agent a expliqué à la demanderesse que, lors de sa première entrevue, elle avait affirmé ne pas avoir de problèmes avec les Al-Shabab, qu'elle n'avait fait mention d'aucune menace ni du fait que la boutique avait été bombardée, alors que la demande précisait que le groupe Al-Shabab voulait qu'elle commette un attentat-suicide à la bombe, et qu'elle avait affirmé dans la deuxième entrevue que le groupe avait bombardé sa boutique. Ces propos étaient contradictoires et l'agent ne pouvait déterminer avec certitude ce qui était vrai. La demanderesse a répondu que ce qu'elle disait était vrai, mais cela n'a pas dissipé les inquiétudes de l'agent.
[16]
L'agent a ensuite dit à la demanderesse que Faduma avait affirmé que le père de la demanderesse était mort plusieurs années avant 2007. La demanderesse a répondu qu'elle était avec son père à sa mort en 2007, et qu'elle n'avait rencontré Faduma qu'une fois arrivée au Kenya. L'agent a noté que cela n'atténuait aucunement les problèmes de crédibilité, puisque la demanderesse avait déclaré dans sa première entrevue être venue au Kenya avec Faduma. L'agent a indiqué à la demanderesse qu'il était préoccupé par le fait qu'elle avait affirmé être venue au Kenya avec Faduma dans la première entrevue, ce à quoi la demanderesse a répondu que Faduma lui avait été présentée par un membre de la famille de son père.
[17]
L'agent a également informé la demanderesse qu'Abdiqani avait dit être venu au Kenya avec la demanderesse et une autre sœur. La demanderesse a répondu que ce n'était pas le cas et que cette sœur était restée en Somalie. Les doutes qu'avait l'agent concernant la crédibilité de la demanderesse ont subsisté en raison des incohérences entre les différents récits. Il a également noté que la demande précisait que la demanderesse était arrivée au Kenya le 1er septembre 2007, alors qu'Abdiqani avait dit au HCNUR qu'il était arrivé le 29 août 2007. Faduma a déclaré être arrivée seule en 2006.
[18]
L'agent a fait part de ses préoccupations à la demanderesse, à savoir qu'il n'était pas plausible qu'elle soit restée au Kenya pendant quatre ans sans aucun document d'identité. La demanderesse a répondu qu'elle ne sortait jamais, qu'elle restait à l'intérieur et qu'elle ne voyageait pas parce qu'elle n'avait pas de documents d'identité. L'agent n'a pas trouvé cette explication satisfaisante. L'agent a également noté que la demanderesse n'a pas répondu lorsqu'il lui a demandé comment sa mère avait pu rester en sécurité en Somalie.
[19]
À la suite de l'entrevue, les notes font état des problèmes de crédibilité de la demanderesse. En premier lieu, on trouve des incohérences dans le témoignage même de la demanderesse, à propos de ce qui leur est arrivé, à elle et à son père, aux mains du groupe Al-Shabab. En deuxième lieu, la demanderesse n'a pas fourni suffisamment de détails sur les menaces proférées contre elle. Lorsqu'on lui a demandé des éclaircissements, elle a donné des réponses contradictoires. En troisième lieu, il y avait des incohérences notables entre les affirmations de la demanderesse et celles d'Abdiqani et de Faduma concernant la mort du père de la demanderesse, la relation entre la demanderesse et Faduma et leur arrivée au Kenya. En quatrième lieu, lorsqu'on lui a donné l'occasion de clarifier les choses, la demanderesse n'a pas apporté de réponses satisfaisantes. Par conséquent, des doutes ont subsisté dans l'esprit de l'agent quant la crédibilité de la demanderesse.
[20]
Dans la lettre de refus, l'agent note que le récit que la demanderesse fait des actes de persécution dans sa demande et celui qu'elle a fait lors de ses entrevues diffère grandement, qu'elle a donné des réponses vagues à propos des menaces proférées à son endroit en Somalie, et qu'il y avait plusieurs incohérences entre son entrevue et l'entrevue avec Abdiqani, ce qui a soulevé des doutes concernant les circonstances de sa fuite de la Somalie. En conséquence, l'agent n'a pas cru qu'il y avait des motifs raisonnables de croire que la demanderesse éprouvait avec raison une crainte de persécution, et sa demande a été rejetée.
QUESTIONS À TRANCHER
[21]
Dans la présente demande, la demanderesse soulève la question suivante:
a. Y a-t-il eu manquement à l'obligation d'équité envers la demanderesse en raison de l'omission de lui communiquer la teneur des entrevues avec Faduma et d'Abdiqani, et de lui donner la possibilité d'y répondre?
NORME DE CONTRÔLE
[22]
La Cour suprême du Canada, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a statué qu'il n'est pas toujours nécessaire de procéder à une analyse relative à la norme de contrôle. En effet, lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable à une question particulière, dont est saisi le tribunal chargé du contrôle, est bien établie par la jurisprudence, le tribunal peut adopter cette norme de contrôle. Ce n'est que lorsque cette recherche se révèle infructueuse que le tribunal chargé du contrôle doit procéder à l'examen des quatre facteurs qui entrent en jeu dans l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle.
[23]
Dans l'arrêt
Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la Cour suprême du Canada a statué, au paragraphe 100, qu'il « appartient aux tribunaux judiciaires et non au ministre de donner une réponse juridique aux questions d'équité procédurale ». En outre, dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> la Cour d'appel fédérale a jugé que « [l]a question de l'équité procédurale est une question de droit. Aucune défense n'est nécessaire. Soit le décideur a respecté l'obligation d'équité dans les circonstances propres à l'affaire, soit il a manqué à cette obligation. » La norme de contrôle applicable à la question soulevée par la demanderesse est celle de la décision correcte.

OBSERVATIONS DES PARTIES
La demanderesse
[26]
La demanderesse souligne que Faduma a déclaré en entrevue qu'elle n'avait pas peur de quoi que ce soit en Somalie, et qu'elle ne savait pas que la demanderesse y avait eu des problèmes. Toutefois, la crainte que Faduma soit venue au Kenya aux seules fins d'être parrainée pour venir au Canada n'a jamais été exprimée à la demanderesse. En effet, la demanderesse a dû présenter une requête devant notre Cour afin de voir le contenu des notes du STIDI sur les entrevues avec Faduma et Abdiqani.
[27]
Des bribes de l'entrevue avec Faduma ont été communiquées à la demanderesse, mais la demanderesse affirme qu'une bonne part de son contenu ne l'a pas été. La demanderesse allègue qu'elle aurait dû être informée du fait que Faduma avait affirmé:
• être venue au Kenya seulement parce que son parrainage avait été entamé au Canada;
• qu'aucun événement problématique en Somalie ne l'avait amenée à fuir;
• qu'elle n'avait pas rempli ses formulaires de demande et que les formulaires de demande (remplis par le même répondant que la demanderesse) ne reflétaient pas la réalité;
• qu'elle ne croyait pas que la demanderesse avait eu des problèmes en Somalie, car elle en aurait entendu parler si cela avait été le cas;
• que la famille vivait à Galkayo, dans un endroit relativement sûr en Somalie.
La demanderesse soutient que ces déclarations lui ont été très préjudiciables, mais qu'elles ne lui ont pas été communiquées. La demanderesse ne savait pas non plus ce qui s'était dit durant l'entrevue avec Abdiqani.
[28]
La demanderesse soutient que l'omission de l'agent de lui communiquer la teneur des autres entrevues équivaut à la non-communication d'une « lettre anonyme malveillante ». Selon la jurisprudence, le contenu de telles lettres doit être communiqué et que l'omission de le faire constitue une infraction à la règle
audi alteram partem
(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En l'espèce, les déclarations de Faduma les plus préjudiciables à la demanderesse ne lui ont jamais été communiquées.
[29]
Qui plus est, la demanderesse affirme que l'on lui a dit à la fin de sa première entrevue qu'une décision positive avait été rendue et qu'elle était en attente des instructions médicales. Elle a également reçu des conseils sur le prêt de transport et son remboursement. Bien que cette communication ne conférait sans doute pas à la demanderesse le droit à une décision favorable, elle a renforcé l'obligation d'agir avec équité envers elle (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 26). Comme il ressort des notes du STIDI, la demanderesse comprenait mal pourquoi elle devait participer à une deuxième entrevue.
[30]
La demanderesse prétend que le fait que notre Cour ait ordonné la communication des notes des entrevues avec Faduma et Abdiqani signifie qu'elles sont pertinentes à son dossier. Comme la demanderesse ne connaissait pas la teneur de ces entrevues, elle n'était pas en mesure de répondre aux préoccupations qu'elles avaient soulevées. La demanderesse aurait dû recevoir une communication intégrale, mais en l'espèce la communication n'a été que partielle. Il y a donc eu manquement à l'obligation d'équité.
Le défendeur
[31]
Le défendeur soutient qu'il n'y a pas eu manquement à l'obligation d'agir avec équité envers la demanderesse. En premier lieu, aucune inférence négative ne peut être tirée de la réponse du défendeur à la demande fondée sur l'article 9 des Règles. Le protonotaire Lafrenière a conclu que la lettre de décision et les notes d'accompagnement du STIDI relatives au dossier de la demanderesse indiquent clairement les motifs du rejet de sa demande, et que ces motifs ont été communiqués dans leur intégralité à la demanderesse. En deuxième lieu, lors de la deuxième entrevue avec la demanderesse, on lui a clairement posé des questions concernant toutes les préoccupations soulevées par les entrevues avec Faduma et Abdiqani, en lui donnant la possibilité de dissiper chacune d'elles.
[32]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> la Cour a déclaré:
La nature de l'obligation d'équité procédurale peut varier selon le contexte. Le respect par un agent des visas de son obligation d'équité doit s'apprécier au cas par cas. La jurisprudence établit clairement que l'obligation d'équité n'est pas violée si le demandeur a la possibilité de répondre aux préoccupations soulevées dans l'esprit de l'agent des visas.
Voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[33]
Lors de la deuxième entrevue, on a posé à la demanderesse des questions détaillées sur les points qui préoccupaient l'agent. L'agent a directement présenté à la demanderesse les renseignements donnés par Faduma et Abdiqani. La demanderesse a répondu aux questions de l'agent de manière vague ou contradictoire par rapport aux réponses données par les membres de sa famille.
[34]
Qui plus est, la demanderesse affirme ne pas avoir eu l'occasion de contrer les préoccupations soulevées par la deuxième entrevue avec Abdiqani, étant donné que cette entrevue a eu lieu après la deuxième entrevue avec la demanderesse, mais les motifs de l'agent ne font aucune mention de la deuxième entrevue avec Abdiqani. Ils ne portent que sur les incohérences soulevées lors de la première entrevue. Par conséquent, il n'y a pas eu manquement à l'obligation d'agir avec équité.
[35]
Le défendeur soutient que toutes les préoccupations de l'agent ont été communiquées à la demanderesse et qu'elle a eu l'occasion d'y répondre. La demanderesse n'a pas réussi à dissiper ces préoccupations et il était raisonnable que l'agent rejette sa demande. Il n'y a pas eu violation de l'obligation d'agir avec équité.
La réponse de la demanderesse
[36]
La demanderesse allègue que les véritables préoccupations de l'agent - à savoir que la demanderesse provient d'une partie sûre de la Somalie, qu'aucun événement n'a provoqué la fuite de la demanderesse du pays, que la demanderesse n'a pas rempli ses formulaires elle-même et que le contenu de ces formulaires ne correspond pas à des événements réels - ne lui ont pas été directement communiquées. Ce fait est évident à la lecture de la deuxième entrevue avec la demanderesse, et le défendeur ne prétend pas le contraire.
[37]
La demanderesse affirme que dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , invoquée par le défendeur, les notes du STIDI indiquaient que les préoccupations avaient été communiquées au demandeur. En l'espèce, il n'y a rien à cet égard dans les notes du STIDI relatives à la deuxième entrevue avec la demanderesse. Il y a une différence entre questions et préoccupations, et le fait pour l'agent de poser d'autres questions à la demanderesse n'équivaut pas à l'informer de ses préoccupations. Les questions de l'agent avaient été posées hors contexte du fait que la demanderesse n'avait pas été informée de la teneur de l'entrevue avec Faduma. Comme il ressort des notes du STIDI, la demanderesse ne comprenait pas ce qui avait motivé la conduite de la deuxième entrevue.
[38]
Bien que le défendeur affirme que la teneur de l'entrevue avec Faduma a été communiquée à la demanderesse, la demanderesse n'a jamais été informée des déclarations de Faduma. La demanderesse aurait dû avoir la possibilité de faire valoir son point de vue à l'agent dans la mesure où ce que Faduma a dit était faux, mais elle n'en a jamais eu l'occasion.
ANALYSE
[39]
La demanderesse soulève la question de l'équité procédurale, sans toutefois aborder le fond de la décision.
[40]
La demande a été rejetée en raison de préoccupations liées à la crédibilité de la demanderesse, qu'elle n'a pas réussi à contrer et à l'égard desquelles elle n'a pu fournir de clarifications lorsqu'elle a eu l'occasion de le faire.
[41]
Comme la décision l'indique clairement, les problèmes de crédibilité sont les suivants:
a) Il y avait un manque de cohérence interne dans les renseignements donnés par la demanderesse. Lors de l'entrevue d'avril 2011, la demanderesse a affirmé qu'elle n'avait aucun problème avec la milice Al-Shabab, mais, lors de la deuxième entrevue, elle a soutenu qu'on lui avait dit qu'elle serait tuée si elle ne ralliait pas la milice. Dans cette même entrevue, elle a également déclaré que la milice lui avait dit qu'elle ne pourrait conserver la boutique que si elle joignait ses rangs et que la boutique a été détruite après le refus de la demanderesse.
Il s'agit d'une conclusion quant aux incohérences internes que présentait le témoignage de la demanderesse elle-même, qu'elle ne conteste pas. Par conséquent, la conclusion est raisonnable. La demanderesse se plaint maintenant du caractère inéquitable de la procédure, parce que l'agent ne lui a pas communiqué la teneur des entrevues avec Faduma et Abdiqani, mais elle n'explique pas quelles incidences cela pourrait avoir eu sur les incohérences de son propre témoignage ayant été portées à son attention, et qu'elle n'a pas réussi à expliquer.
b) Le deuxième problème sur le plan de la crédibilité concernait le fait que la demanderesse n'a pas fourni suffisamment de détails ou de précisions sur les menaces proférées à son endroit. Elle a donné des réponses vagues et, lorsqu'on lui a demandé des éclaircissements, ses réponses étaient contradictoires.
Une fois de plus, cette conclusion quant à la crédibilité a trait aux problèmes présents dans le témoignage de la demanderesse elle-même, qu'elle ne conteste pas dans la présente demande. Par conséquent, la conclusion est raisonnable. Et encore une fois, la demanderesse ne parvient pas à expliquer comment le fait de ne pas lui avoir communiqué la teneur des entrevues avec Faduma et Abdiqani peut avoir eu une incidence sur les problèmes constatés dans son propre témoignage ayant été expressément portés à son attention et qu'elle n'a pas pu ou pas voulu expliquer.
c) La troisième conclusion négative quant à la crédibilité repose sur les importantes contradictions relevées par l'agent « entre les déclarations faites par [la demanderesse], son demi-frère et Faduma en entrevue ». L'agent indique expressément ce en quoi elles consistent:
(i) Faduma a affirmé que le père de la demanderesse était mort alors qu'elle était enfant, de nombreuses années avant 2007. La demanderesse avait affirmé qu'elle était avec son père à sa mort en 2007;
(ii) Faduma a affirmé que la demanderesse était sa tante et qu'elles avaient été en contact et s'étaient connues en Somalie. Lors de la première entrevue, la demanderesse a déclaré qu'elle et Faduma étaient venues à Nairobi ensemble, mais lors de la deuxième entrevue, elle a affirmé avoir rencontré Faduma à Nairobi. Encore une fois, il s'agit d'une incohérence interne dans le témoignage même de la demanderesse, qu'elle n'a pas réussi à expliquer quand la question lui a été posée et qu'elle ne remet pas en cause dans la présente demande;
(iii) lors de la première entrevue, la demanderesse a affirmé être venue au Kenya avec Abdiqani, son demi-frère, un cousin, et Faduma. Dans une entrevue menée séparément, Faduma a dit être venue seule au Kenya en 2006. Il s'agit là d'une incohérence entre les déclarations de différents témoins, mais cette incohérence a été expressément portée à l'attention de la demanderesse, qui n'a pu l'expliquer;
(iv) dans une entrevue menée séparément, Abdiqani a déclaré être venu au Kenya avec la demanderesse et une sœur, nommée Istahil. Toutefois, la demanderesse a déclaré que ce n'était pas le cas, Istahil étant toujours en Somalie.
[42]
Les incohérences sur ces points précis ont toutes été portées à la connaissance de la demanderesse, qui n'a pu les expliquer. Cela a conduit l'agent à conclure, raisonnablement, à [traduction] « un manque de clarté sur la composition de la famille, les dates d'arrivée et la date de la mort du père dans ces trois dossiers connexes ».
[43]
La demanderesse affirme avoir subi un préjudice parce que l'ensemble de l'entrevue avec Faduma ne lui a pas été communiqué, et que Faduma a dit beaucoup de choses qui ont nui à la demande d'asile de la demanderesse, auxquelles elle n'a pas eu la possibilité de répondre. Comme l'indique la décision, cependant, les préoccupations de l'agent quant à la crédibilité de la demanderesse ne reposaient pas toutes sur ce que Faduma a dit. Elles étaient fondées sur des incohérences présentes dans le témoignage de la demanderesse et des incohérences précises entre les propos de la demanderesse et les propos de Faduma et d'Abdiqani, incohérences qui ont été portées à l'attention de la demanderesse et qu'elle n'a pu expliquer.
[44]
La demanderesse allègue que ce qui s'est passé dans ce dossier équivaut à une omission de communiquer une lettre anonyme malveillante (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée) et que les déclarations les plus préjudiciables de Faduma ne lui ont jamais été communiquées. Je suis en désaccord avec cette analogie.
[45]
L'agent ne fonde pas sa décision sur l'intégralité du témoignage de Faduma. Sa décision est fondée sur les incohérences présentes dans le témoignage de la demanderesse et sur des incohérences précises entre les récits de Faduma, d'Abdiqani et de la demanderesse, incohérences qui ont toutes été signalées à la demanderesse et qu'elle n'a pu expliquer. Il n'était pas nécessaire de communiquer toute la teneur des propos de Faduma à la demanderesse, la décision n'étant pas fondée sur la totalité des incohérences entre les récits de Faduma, d'Abdiqani et de la demanderesse. Les incohérences précises entre les affirmations des demandeurs signifiaient seulement qu'il y avait [traduction] « un manque de clarté sur la composition de la famille, les dates d'arrivée et la date de la mort du père dans ces trois dossiers connexes ». Les autres problèmes sont liés aux incohérences présentes dans le propre témoignage de la demanderesse.
[46]
La seule question que soulève la demanderesse a trait au fait que l'entrevue avec Faduma a suscité d'autres préoccupations, qui n'ont pas été portées à sa connaissance afin qu'elle puisse y répondre. Elle fait valoir que ces préoccupations ont eu une incidence importante sur la décision de l'agent et qu'elles ont influé sur son appréciation de l'ensemble du témoignage de la demanderesse. En d'autres termes, selon la thèse de la demanderesse, la décision est fondée, au moins en partie, sur les affirmations suivantes que Faduma a faites en entrevue:
a) elle est venue en Somalie seulement parce qu'une demande de parrainage la concernant avait été présentée au Canada;
b) aucun événement problématique ne l'avait amenée à fuir;
c) elle n'avait pas rempli ses formulaires et les renseignements figurant dans les formulaires, remplis par le même répondant que celui de la demanderesse, ne correspondaient pas à des événements réels;
d) elle ne croyait pas que la demanderesse éprouvait des problèmes, parce qu'elle en aurait entendu parler si tel était le cas;
e) la famille vivait à Galkayo, un endroit relativement sûr en Somalie.
[47]
La demanderesse affirme que ces déclarations de Faduma lui étaient très préjudiciables, mais qu'elles n'ont pas été portées à sa connaissance et qu'on ne lui a pas offert l'occasion d'y répondre.
[48]
Cela ne constitue qu'une simple affirmation. Aucun élément devant moi ne permet de conclure que la décision était fondée sur autre chose que les préoccupations exprimées dans les notes du STIDI. Les notes du STIDI indiquent que les préoccupations ont été soulevées à la suite des entrevues avec Faduma et Abdiqani. Chacune de ces préoccupations a par la suite été précisément et systématiquement présentée à la demanderesse, et elle y a répondu. Il n'était pas nécessaire de présenter toute la teneur des propos de Faduma à la demanderesse pour déterminer la présence d'écarts importants entre leurs récits respectifs, que la demanderesse n'a pu résoudre.
[49]
L'argument de la demanderesse repose en fait sur l'allégation que l'agent a omis de communiquer une preuve extrinsèque, définie par le juge Rothstein dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 23, comme s'agissant « d'éléments de preuve dont la partie requérante ignore l'existence et que l'agent d'immigration a l'intention d'invoquer pour en arriver à une décision touchant cette partie ». Il est bien établi qu'un agent d'immigration doit communiquer les renseignements extrinsèques sur lesquels il entend fonder sa décision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF)), y compris les renseignements recueillis lors d'entrevues menées séparément avec des personnes liées à la demande ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée). Cependant, il n'existe aucune obligation de communiquer des renseignements qui ne servent pas d'assise à la décision:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; voir également
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 26 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[50]
La demanderesse demande à la Cour de conclure que la décision était fondée sur des facteurs qui ne sont pas soulevés dans les motifs. Rien ne permet de conclure en ce sens. Le dossier fait clairement état des motifs à l'origine de la décision et des raisons pour lesquelles l'agent n'a pu accepter la demande de la demanderesse. En l'absence de preuve voulant que l'agent d'immigration se soit appuyé sur des renseignements non communiqués pour en arriver à sa décision, la Cour ne devrait pas conclure à la présence d'irrégularités dans ses motifs ou sa conduite: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 27. La demanderesse ne prétend pas que la décision était déraisonnable, compte tenu de ce que les notes du STIDI révèlent.

Les tribunaux doivent bien sûr être conscients de la possibilité que des renseignements entre les mains d'un décideur, qui ne sont pas soulevés dans les motifs d'une décision, puissent néanmoins avoir influé sur sa décision. Cependant, à mon avis, cette question ne se pose pas en l'espèce. Il y avait plusieurs écarts entre le récit de la demanderesse et ceux de Faduma et d'Abdiqani. Le fait que l'agent ait retenu certaines de ces contradictions et cherché à confronter la demanderesse à certaines d'entre elles seulement n'entache pas le caractère équitable de la décision. Comme le juge Rothstein l'expliquait dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 26, la raison pour laquelle les demandeurs d'asile doivent être informés des préoccupations que soulèvent les renseignements contradictoires obtenus en leur absence est qu'« en refusant à la partie requérante la possibilité de répondre aux écarts, l'agent risque de rendre une décision fondée sur un malentendu ou sur de simples écarts involontaires ». En l'espèce, l'agent a pris des mesures pour veiller à ce que cela ne se produise pas, en procédant à une seconde entrevue et en confrontant la demanderesse aux préoccupations soulevées. C'est tout ce qui était requis: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 10. L'agent était en droit de conclure que les explications de la demanderesse étaient insuffisantes: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, aux paragraphes 26 et 27.
[52]
Aucun aspect de la décision n'est déraisonnable ou inéquitable.

Les avocats conviennent qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier, et la Cour est du même avis.

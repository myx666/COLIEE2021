 Gibson, J. 
 : This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division (the "CRDD") of the Immigration and Refugee Board wherein the CRDD determined the applicants not to be Convention refugees within the meaning of the  
 Immigration Act 
  (R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2). The decision of the CRDD is dated the 22nd day of February, 1993.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

  The applicants, a mother and her young daughter, are citizens of Sri Lanka. They are of Tamil nationality. They base their claims to Convention refugee status on an alleged well-founded fear of persecution if they are required to return to Sri Lanka by reason of their nationality, political opinion and membership in a particular social group. The daughter's claim is based entirely on the claim of her mother.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The facts drawn from the Personal Information Form of the adult applicant and her oral testimony may be summarized as follows. Between 1982 and 1984, the adult applicant worked in a government office in Mullaithivu in the Vavuniya area of northern Sri Lanka. Her duties included the issuance of maps and stationery to Sri Lankan military personnel. This involved regular interaction with the military personnel. On the basis of this interaction, unidentified "militants" suspected the adult applicant of working with the military and sent her threatening letters and visited her at her home on a regular basis. Her family was threatened and forced to pay extortion money by the militants. She sought and received protection through the police. In the spring of 1984, at least partly because of the continuing threats, she moved to Colombo. At some time after her move to Colombo, she resumed employment with the Sri Lankan government.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  In June of 1985, the adult applicant was married. The wedding reception was marred by a bomb threat. Once again the adult applicant sought and obtained police protection.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Between 1985 and 1990 the applicant had residences in both Colombo and Mullaithivu. She apparently moved back and forth between the two residences encountering difficulty at military check points along the way. She gave birth to her daughter in December, 1989. Sometime following her maternity leave, she voluntarily terminated her employment with the Sri Lankan government. A contributing factor to her leaving employment may have been discrimination based on the fact that she was a Tamil.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  In 1987 her dowry home in the north of Sri Lanka was taken over by the Tamil Tigers. The Tamil Tigers came to suspect the adult applicant and her family of supporting the EPLRF. The adult applicant's husband and father-in-law were rounded up, arrested by the Tigers and beaten and released only on payment of a bribe.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  In early 1990 members of the Special Task Force (the "STF"), apparently a paramilitary unit of the Sri Lankan military or government, began to visit her home in Colombo to inquire as to the whereabouts of her husband. In February 1990, the applicant's husband went to Jaffna. He did not return. The adult applicant has not heard from him since. The STF continued to harass the adult applicant in Colombo. Also in Colombo, unidentified "militant groups" demanded money and threatened to kidnap her daughter. In August of 1990, the STF threatened to arrest her.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  On the 2nd day of September, 1990, the applicants fled Sri Lanka. They arrived in Switzerland shortly thereafter and remained in that country for some 18 months before coming to Canada and making refugee claims here in the spring of 1992.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  While I regard the foregoing as a reasonable summary of the adult applicant's evidence that was before the CRDD, that evidence is complex, in some areas vague and in other areas contradictory. Taken as a whole, I would regard it as less than satisfactory. Despite my concerns about the evidence, the CRDD found the adult applicant's evidence "... to be both internally and externally consistent". The CRDD found no major reason to disbelieve the adult applicant's testimony.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  The CRDD's analysis in its reasons for decision is relatively brief and is in the following terms:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Given the objective conditions in Northern Sri Lanka as described in the various documentary evidence presented at the hearing and the claimant's own experience in that part of Sri Lanka, the panel is of the opinion that there is a reasonable chance that the claimant may be seriously harmed by the LTTE should she return there.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The panel has also addressed the issue of whether the claimant has an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Colombo.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The well-foundedness of the claimant's fear of persecution in Colombo or the lack thereof, has to be established in order to address this issue.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The claimant's evidence shows that she was employed by the Ministry of Policy Planning in Colombo from March 1984 to June 1990. She left her job voluntarily. Her mother still resides in Colombo.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Although members of the Special Task Force harassed the claimant beginning January 1990, because they wanted to know the whereabouts of her husband, they finally believed her that he was indeed missing. The evidence also shows that the claimant had reported the disappearance of her husband to the police in Colombo when he did not return home in February 1990. In the panel's opinion, it is unlikely that the Sri Lankan authorities would still harass the claimant because they might want to know about the whereabouts of her husband should she return to that country at the present time.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The claimant's sense of insecurity in Colombo because militant groups had threatened to kidnap her daughter unless she paid them money is a reasonable one. However, the claimant did not even identify these groups. Her evidence does not show that she sought state protection from such groups. In the absence of evidence as to how the Sri Lankan authorities responded to the claimant's request for protection from these groups, the panel did not find any inability of the Sri Lankan Government to provide protection to the claimant. For the same reason, state complicity in the claimant's difficulties with these groups was not established.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In view of all the foregoing, the panel concludes that the claimant's evidence does not establish a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombo based on any one of the grounds in the definition of a Convention refugee in the  
 Immigration Act 
 . <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [11] 
  In the respondent's further memorandum of argument filed the 6th day of June, 1994, it is admitted that the statements in the foregoing quotation that the adult applicant was employed by the Ministry of Policy Planning in Colombo from March 1984, to June 1990, and that the STF finally accepted her explanation that her husband was indeed missing are in error. Neither of these statements are borne out by the evidence that was before the CRDD.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  With respect to the first of these statements, that is that the adult applicant was employed by the Ministry of Policy Planning in Colombo from March 1984, to June 1990, while it tends to support the reasonableness of an internal flight alternative for the applicants to Colombo, I am satisfied that it is not critical to the CRDD's decision. The adult applicant was certainly employed by the Ministry of Policy Planning in Colombo for a significant portion of the period cited by the CRDD. That reality is sufficient to constitute a contributing element in a determination that an internal flight alternative to Colombo would be reasonable for the adult applicant and her daughter.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  prejudice is caused by an erroneous procedure or decision an order quashing the decision will not normally be given. If no real purpose will be served by requiring another hearing, one will not be ordered". I find the principle enunciated by Madam Justice Reed to apply equally to the finding of fact regarding the adult applicant's period of employment in Colombo.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  On the other hand, the finding that the Special Task Force finally came to believe the adult applicant's assertion that her husband was indeed missing is of a different nature. That finding implies that the basis for the STF's ongoing harassment of the adult applicant was eliminated. This flies in the face of the evidence that as late as August 1990, the STF threatened the adult applicant with arrest. If the statement were accurate, it would eliminate one of the bases for the adult applicant's alleged fear of return to Colombo. It would support the finding that Colombo constituted a reasonable internal flight alternative for the applicants. Finally, it would eliminate the adult applicant's basis for reluctance to seek state protection in Colombo against her fear of the militants who had threatened to kidnap her daughter because the STF, itself an arm of the state, would no longer constitute a potential source of persecution of the applicants.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in a decision of the Immigration Appeal Board, stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "We cannot be sure that, if the Board had correctly appreciated the facts, it would necessarily have reached the same conclusion. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  version of her reasons, stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "However, the Court is not certain that if it had not been for this error as to the town where the claimant lived the Refugee Division would necessarily have come to the same conclusion. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 In both cases, the appeal was allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  I reach the same conclusion here. It is not for me to speculate whether the CRDD would have reached the same conclusion in this matter if it had not erred in finding that the evidence showed that the STF finally came to believe the adult applicant regarding the fact that her husband had gone missing. If the decision of the CRDD might have been different had it not fallen into this error, and I am satisfied that it very well might have been different, then the decision of the CRDD should be set aside and the matter referred back for redetermination.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  For the foregoing reasons, I have set aside the decision of the CRDD in this matter and referred it back for rehearing and redetermination. Counsel for the applicants requested that I go further, that I declare the applicants to be Convention refugees. That relief is not open to me [see footnote 4]. In the alternative, counsel requested that the matter be returned to the CRDD to determine that the applicants are Convention refugees or for redetermination in accordance with directions of this court [see footnote 5]. I am not at all satisfied that the facts of this matter warrant such an order.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  I have however modified the normal order of reference back, as requested, once again in the alternative, by counsel for the applicants to indicate that the CRDD should take into account the record before the panel that has already heard this matter as well as any other evidence that the new panel considers appropriate. While I am not satisfied that an order requiring the CRDD to take into account the record before a previous panel is necessary, that option always being open to a second panel, counsel advised me that some panels of the CRDD have been reluctant in a hearing de novo to do anything else than to in fact start "de novo" ignoring all of the evidence previously before the earlier panel. That strikes me as a significant waste of resources. While, as in this case, the evidence before the earlier panel may not be fully satisfactory, it should be possible to overcome the weaknesses in the earlier evidence by supplementing that evidence. It should not be necessary to revert to the beginning.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  Finally, neither counsel before me recommended that a question be certified. No question is certified.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

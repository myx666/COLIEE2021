de Montigny, J.
: Mr
.
Sujeewan Suppaiah (the "Applicant") seeks judicial review of the decision of Mr. Edward Aronoff (the "Board member") of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB or the "Board"), Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated May 2, 2012. The Applicant requests that this Court quash the Board member's decision, which concluded that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection.
[2]
For the reasons set out below, I find that the application for judicial review ought to be dismissed.
Facts
[3]
The Applicant was born in Sri Lanka on January 1, 1982, and is of Tamil ethnicity and Hindu faith. He has four siblings, three of whom have successfully claimed refugee status in Canada and a younger brother who remains in Sri Lanka, allegedly living under the protection of Catholic priests in the North of the country. The Applicant's parents are currently living in the village of Neervely in the Jaffna district, which was the family's home until they were displaced for the first time in 1994.
[4]
From 1990 to 1995, Neervely was under the control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ("LTTE"). The Applicant's family experienced problems during this time and was forced to move around a number of times in 1994, due to the war. They returned to Neervely in 1995, but continued to have problems.
[5]
The Applicant's own problems began in 2007, after he had completed his studies and worked on his family's farm for a number of years. In March of that year, the Applicant was arrested by the Sri Lankan Army (SLA), and held and beaten on suspicion of being an LTTE member. He was released after his mother intervened, on the condition that he report back daily and agree to report to the SLA if he were to become aware of any LTTE members living in the village. After two days, the SLA no longer required him to report.
[6]
During the month of April in 2007, the Applicant was working in the fields and had a second encounter with the SLA. He claims that he was beaten and that they may have shot him if his mother had not arrived to deliver food at that time. Over the course of the month he was taken a number of times with several others before a masked man who identified members of the LTTE among them; the Applicant, however, was always released.
[7]
Concerned for his safety, the Applicant made plans to leave the village. When he was unable to obtain a travel permit on his own, his family sought permits, telling the authorities they would travel to India, but ultimately relocating to Colombo in May 2007. They intended to stay, but sought temporary accommodations in a lodge with other Tamils.
[8]
At this point, one of the Applicant's brothers in Canada suggested the family should stay in Colombo and he would sponsor them. Problems arose, however, with the police frequently requesting identification from residents at the lodge. In one instance, the brothers were taken to the police station with other young Tamils, interrogated, asked to remove their clothes, and only released when the owner of the lodge signed a release form of some sort.
[9]
In July 2007, the brothers and other young Tamils were again taken to the police station, told they should not reside in Colombo, and put on a bus that took them to a school in Vavuniya, in Northern Sri Lanka. Although the young Tamils were returned to Colombo the following day, the Applicant's family left shortly thereafter for Vavuniya.
[10]
Despite the fact that he was initially afraid to leave the house due to the activities of armed Tamil groups including the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP), the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), the Applicant took an electrician course from February to September, 2008, travelling back and forth each day in fear. He subsequently worked as an apprentice.
[11]
Beginning in November 2008, the family was threatened three times by the EPDP who demanded money but ultimately ceased harassing the family when they explained they had none since they had been displaced.
[12]
Due to the fear of being abducted or arrested by the SLA after the war ended in May 2009 and the fact that the Canadian sponsorship application was not being finalized, the Applicant's parents decided to send him to Canada on his own with the help of an agent. They could not afford to send both him and his brother. The Applicant left Vavuniya on February 11, 2010, arriving in Canada on June 3, 2010 via Dubai, Russia, Cuba, Ecuador, Belize, Guatemala, Mexico and the United States.
[13]
A letter from the Applicant's father, dated March 31, 2012, suggests that after the Applicant left Sri Lanka the EPDP came to the house and threatened their remaining son, demanding all of the family's money and jewellery. Although they paid, the armed men said they should get more money from their children living abroad. The men told the family they would return and warned them not to report what had happened to the police or media. When the men again phoned to demand money and threaten the remaining son, the boy was sent to live in hiding with Catholic priests. The parents at first stayed with friends, but returned to their village of Neervely after the windows of their house were broken in Vavuniya.
[14]
When the son visited Neervely, the EPDP recognized him, pursued him, and only gave up their chase when he was hit by a car and the general public took note. Fearing for his safety, the Catholic priests sent him to their northern headquarters, where he continues to fear for his life.
[15]
The father's letter indicates that he did not initially share this information with the Applicant, as he did not want him to worry.
Decision under review
[16]
The Board member concluded that the Applicant is not a "Convention refugee" as contemplated by section 96 or a "person in need of protection" pursuant to section 97(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (the "Act"). He noted that the Applicant's claim is based on his well-founded fear of persecution as a young male Tamil from Northern Sri Lanka and on his perceived political opinion of being sympathetic to and/or a member of the LTTE, as well as by reason of his nationality.
[17]
In describing the Applicant's allegations, the Board member stated that the Applicant "lived without any problems [in Vavuniya, from 2007] until he left during the month of February 2010, on his journey towards Canada" (Decision, para 4). Although the hearing transcript suggests that the Applicant disputed this description, arguing that the EPDP gave them problems in Vavuniya (Tribunal Record, p 590), he agreed with the Board member that he was able to study and work as an apprentice during his time there. His younger brother was not allowed to go to school, however, and their father didn't work because it would not have been safe.
[18]
Despite finding that the Applicant lived in Vavuniya without any problems, the Board member acknowledged that the situation was not stable and that the family received calls from the EPDP on three occasions, attempting to extort money. He observed that they were no longer harassed when the parents explained they were displaced persons.
[19]
The Board member noted that the Applicant had never been involved with the LTTE and reasoned that the SLA would not have permitted his release on the various occasions he claims to have been detained had the SLA believed him to be a member of the LTTE. He also noted that the Applicant acknowledged at his hearing that the SLA would never have issued his family a permit to travel to India had they believed him to be an LTTE member.
[20]
The Board member observed that the Applicant and his brother were in every instance released without further consequences when detained in Colombo and noted that the Applicant possessed an identification card between the months of July 2007 and February 2010 that enabled him to work in Vavuniya. During that time, although suspected members and/or sympathizers of the LTTE were being arrested, particularly after the end of the war, the Applicant was never detained or questioned. Finally, the Board member noted that the Applicant was permitted to depart from Sri Lanka in February 2010 using his own passport.
[21]
Based on the above, the Board member concluded that not only was the Applicant not associated with the LTTE, but the SLA was also satisfied that he was not involved. The member observed that, apart from those suspected of LTTE involvement, Tamil life has improved since the LTTE laid down its arms in May 2009. He cited a 2010 document from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that comments on this improvement, indicating that all asylum seekers may once again be considered on their individual merit. Although certain profiles are said to still need particularly careful examination, young Tamils are not identified as one such group. The Board member found as follows:
The claimant was a victim of harassment because he was a young Tamil male, but the actions of the government during the civil war do not support a conclusion that the claimant would be perceived today as someone with links to the LTTE.
[22]
The Board member concluded that the Applicant's profile does not fit that of a person having suspected links with the LTTE (identified in the UNHCR guidelines as a profile still at risk) and that, on a balance of probabilities, there is no serious possibility that the Applicant would be persecuted in Sri Lanka.
[23]
In response to the Applicant's fear that he would be kidnapped by members of the EPDP, as reflected in the letter from his father and in the updated Personal Information Form (PIF), the Board member "doubts the credibility of such narrative update" (Decision, para 13), as the Applicant's claim made in June 2010 indicated that his parents were already living in Neervely and his PIF, signed in July 2010, indicated his brother was living there also. Taking issue with inconsistencies in the Applicant's corrections to his PIF, the Board member found that the Applicant would not have been in a position to indicate that his family was already living in Neervely if the allegations surrounding the father's letter were true.
[24]
In light of his findings regarding the credibility of the letter, the Board member concluded that the Applicant's parents, and most likely his brother as well, had been living in Neervely for approximately two years and that there was no evidence that they had suffered any threats or harassment by members of the EPDP.
[25]
In response to the Applicant's assertion that everyone is being threatened by the EPDP, the Board member cited evidence suggesting the EPDP is only concerned with individuals suspected of supporting or fighting for the LTTE (such that the Applicant would not be at risk). The member identified a second document from the British High Commission in Colombo, according to which statements by a Sri Lankan police officer and government agent establish that paramilitary groups no longer operate in Jaffna or constitute a serious problem. While he then went on to cite a number of documents describing the EPDP's ongoing activities, the Board member concluded that there is no evidence to suggest that the Applicant would personally face a risk at the hands of the EPDP, particularly since even if a risk of extortion were found to exist it would constitute a generalized risk.
Issues
[26]
This application raises three primary issues:
(i) Did the Board err in failing to consider the most recent documentation on country conditions?
(ii) Is the Board member's decision reasonable in light of his decision to give no weight to the Applicant's updated PIF and the information provided by the Applicant's father?
(iii) Did the Board member err in failing to assess the submission by the Applicant's counsel that the Applicant would be at risk in Sri Lanka as a returnee from abroad?
Analysis
[27]
As submitted by the Respondent, the standard of review applicable to findings of fact and credibility is that of reasonableness: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . As is now well established, reasonableness is concerned with justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process, and with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47.
[28]
The Applicant submitted that the Board member's failure to assess his submissions regarding risk in Sri Lanka as a returnee from abroad is a question of natural justice, compromising the Applicant's right to a fair hearing. I do not think this is a tenable position given the facts of this case. By not addressing this issue explicitly in its reasons, the Board most likely determined implicitly that it was without merit. This is a finding of fact and of credibility, just like the two previous issues raised by the Applicant.
(i) Did the Board err in failing to consider the most recent documentation on country conditions?
[29]
The Applicant submits that the Board member committed a fundamental error in his analysis of country conditions by relying exclusively on the 2010 UNHCR document, while failing to consider more recent documentation on country conditions. Relying on three Responses to Information Requests from July and August 2011, the Applicant asserts that, contrary to the Board member's findings, country conditions in Sri Lanka are in fact deteriorating and young male Tamils from the North are once again the victims of murder and disappearance. The Applicant also produced a voluminous selection of articles documenting the murders and abductions of young Tamil males from the North. Finally, the Applicant referred in his supplementary memorandum to a recent decision of Justice Martineau (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) in which the Judge found that a conclusion that relied on the UNHCR document was unreasonable in light of the more recent documentary evidence available at the time of the hearing. The Applicant filed as additional exhibits a positive decision by the RPD regarding a claimant from Sri Lanka and a positive Pre-Removal Risk Assessment decision also regarding a claimant from Sri Lanka.
[30]
I agree with counsel for the Applicant that a failure by a tribunal to take into account material evidence amounts to a reviewable error, and that the Board has an obligation to refer to important evidence regarding country conditions that goes against its ultimate findings:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  submitted by the Applicant, however, I do not think that the Board erred in not referring to that evidence.
[31]
First of all, and as noted by the Respondent, the Board member did refer to more recent evidence at paragraphs 14-15 of his decision, and he himself introduced a more recent documentation package, dated February 9, 2012, at the outset of the Applicant's hearing. He acknowledged that the situation in Sri Lanka is in a state of flux and noted that he had reviewed certain sections of that package and determined that it should be included in the record.
[32]
Second, and more importantly, the main basis for the Board's decision is that the Applicant was not suspected by the Government of being a member of the LTTE. The Board came to that conclusion on the grounds that the Applicant was released every time he was arrested and detained, that the Applicant and his family were able to obtain exit permits allowing them to travel to India, that he possessed an identification card that enabled him to work in Vavuniya between July 2007 and February 2010, that the Applicant was not detained or questioned at the end of the war while suspected members and sympathizers of LTTE were being arrested, and that he was allowed to leave Sri Lanka with his own passport in February 2010. The Board could reasonably conclude, on the basis of these facts, that the Applicant was not suspected of being an LTTE militant.
[33]
A careful reading of the three Responses to Information Requests submitted by the Applicant as exhibits to his further affidavit do not show that persons not suspected of being LTTE members face more than a mere possibility of persecution. The fact that Tamil citizens, particularly young males between the ages of 18 and 35, are subjected to harassment, prejudice and even discrimination appears, unfortunately, to remain prevalent in Sri Lanka. The first document, dated July 12, 2011 (LKA103782.E), shows that there has been increased surveillance, arrests and detentions of Tamil citizens since February 2011 under suspicion of being members or sympathizers of the LTTE. The second document, dated August 22, 2011 (LKA103816.E), indicates that the requirement for Tamils to register with the police was reinstated in July in different areas of Colombo. The final document, dated August 15, 2011 (LKA103784.E), speaks of the recourses available to Jaffna Tamils who have been victims of human rights violations, and of the challenges faced by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. None of these documents detract from the 2010 UNHCR guidelines stating that all asylum seekers should be considered on their individual merits and that individuals with certain profiles (which the Applicant does not fit) require a particularly careful examination of the possible risks that they may face.
[34]
The Applicant submitted to the IRB that he would still be at risk if he returned to Sri Lanka because he could be targeted by way of suspicion of LTTE involvement. Without further details, this is clearly insufficient. As Justice Tremblay-Lamer wrote in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (at para 20):
To benefit from Canada's protection under section 97 of the IRPA, the applicant must show the probable existence of personal danger, i.e. danger to which other people from or in the country are generally not exposed (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No. 222 (QL) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 143 (QL)). The mere fact of being a young Tamil man from the east of Sri Lanka does not constitute personal danger. The panel found that the SLA's acts toward the applicant seemed to have always been instigated by the Pillaiyan group, and that he was able to obtain a Sri Lankan passport and leave the country, despite the fact that the Tamils in the north and east are subject to heightened attention from the authorities. By taking these factors into account, and considering that he has never had ties to the LTTE and that the Sri Lanka government released thousands of members of the LTTE, the panel concluded that the interest of the Sri Lankan authorities in the applicant, if there is any, is minimal and that there is only a mere possibility of his being persecuted in Trincomalee or elsewhere in the country. I am of the opinion that the decision of the panel falls within possible, acceptable outcomes.
[35]
I agree with the Respondent that the Applicant's reliance on positive RPD and PRRA decisions of other Sri Lankan claimants is of no help to him. The fact that different administrative tribunals presented with different facts granted positive decisions to asylum seekers is completely irrelevant in answering the question of whether the impugned decision is reasonable. Moreover, the applicable standard of review is reasonableness, not correctness. The fact that another decision-maker came to a different result in another claim, even in a claim involving a relative, is of no import because there is in most cases a range of acceptable and possible outcomes that may be defensible, and not only one correct answer.
[36]
Finally, this case can be distinguished from the decision of Justice Martineau in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . First, it appears that the decision under review in that case was only two pages long and that a key ground of attack was that the RPD failed to engage in a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the evidence of fundamental changes in current country conditions. Indeed, the Judge found that the documentary evidence considered by the RPD and referred to in the impugned decision was "highly selective and very hastily analyzed" (at para 17). I do not think the same can be said here. The Board's decision is thorough and well reasoned and, as already mentioned, the Board member referred to a number of country conditions documents, one of them as recent as February 2012. Moreover, the applicant in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> appears to have been released from detention on more than one occasion only upon payment of a bribe, which was not the case for the Applicant in the situation under consideration here. For all of these reasons, I find that the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case is clearly distinguishable from the one before me.
ii) Is the Board member's decision reasonable in light of his decision to give no weight to the Applicant's updated PIF and the information provided by the Applicant's father?
[37]
In response to the Board member's credibility findings regarding the father's letter, the Applicant argues that he knew when he arrived in Canada that his family had left Vavuniya for Neervely, but he didn't know why and had no reason to suspect that his brother wouldn't be there as well. According to the Applicant, this finding of the Board member demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the evidence.
[38]
The Board was entitled to look at the PIF before and after the amendments and to conclude that the Applicant had tried to embellish his story. This is an issue of credibility, which the Board member was in a much better position to decide than this Court.
[39]
Moreover, the Applicant has not established that the information refused by the Board member would have been sufficient to change his conclusion. The refused allegations connected the persecution of the Applicant's brother to extortion by the EPDP and not to any conclusion or suspicion that the brother was connected with the LTTE. The Applicant has not established that it was unreasonable for the Board member to conclude that EPDP extortion is a generalized risk in Sri Lanka, or rebutted the Respondent's assertions that widespread crime in a claimant's country of origin is insufficient in and of itself to establish persecution (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Therefore, the Applicant has failed to demonstrate that, even if the Board member were found to have erred in refusing to consider the updates to the Applicant's PIF, such an error would be determinative or render the Board member's ultimate decision unreasonable.
iii) Did the Board member err in failing to assess the submission by the Applicant's counsel that the Applicant would be at risk in Sri Lanka as a returnee from abroad?
[40]
In the last paragraphs of her submissions, counsel for the Applicant indicates that the Board member erred in failing to conduct an analysis of the risk the Applicant would face in Sri Lanka as a returnee from abroad. She notes that this was raised in her closing arguments at the hearing and that specific reference was made to a report by a UK group called
Freedom from Torture
which documents several cases of torture upon return to Sri Lanka, many of which involved individuals with no specific profile. She argues that the Board member's failure to address these arguments constitutes a reviewable error and a violation of natural justice, compromising the Applicant's right to a fair hearing.
[41]
Once again, I agree with the Respondent that the Board did not err in not addressing this risk. The Applicant did not write in his PIF that he would be at risk as a returnee from abroad, nor did he testify at his hearing on this issue. A brief reference by counsel to a document during her oral submissions at the end of the hearing does not trigger a duty on the Board to address this new ground in its reasons. While the failure by the Board to consider an additional ground of persecution can be fatal to its decision, I agree with Justice Near (now sitting on the Court of Appeal) that it will not be the case when the issue represents an afterthought not supported by the evidence, as opposed to one of the central bases of a claim:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[42]
Moreover, this document reports the cases of 35 victims of torture in Sri Lanka, 14 of whom spent periods of time abroad prior to being deported to Sri Lanka; however, the document does not say that people deported to Sri Lanka are systematically detained and tortured. On the contrary, it states that all individuals reported being targeted due to an actual or perceived association with the LTTE (Tribunal Record, p 409). In the conclusion, we also find the following statement: "Freedom from Torture's forensic evidence demonstrates that, notwithstanding the formal conclusion of hostilities, Tamils with an actual or perceived association with the LTTE remain at particular risk of detention and torture in Sri Lanka" (Tribunal Record, p 430).
[43]
As the Board member concluded that the Sri Lankan government did not seriously consider that the Applicant was an LTTE member or that he had any association with them, the
Freedom from Torture
document cannot be taken to suggest that the Applicant would be at any greater risk as a result of the fact that he would be returning to Sri Lanka as a returnee from abroad.
Conclusion
[44]
For all the foregoing reasons, this application for judicial review is dismissed. The parties have not submitted questions for certification, and no question warrants certification.
JUDGMENT
[45]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
this application for judicial review is dismissed. The parties have not submitted questions for certification, and no question warrants certification.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Monsieur Sujeewan Suppaiah (le demandeur) sollicite le contrôle judiciaire de la décision rendue le 2 mai 2012 par M. Edward Aronoff (le commissaire), commissaire de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la CISR ou la Commission). Le demandeur prie la Cour d'annuler cette décision par laquelle le commissaire a conclu qu'il n'avait qualité ni de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni de personne à protéger.
[2]
Pour les motifs dont l'exposé suit, je conclus que la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être rejetée.
Les faits
[3]
Le demandeur, né au Sri Lanka le 1er janvier 1982, est d'ethnie tamoule et de religion hindoue. Il a quatre frères et sœur, dont trois ont obtenu l'asile au Canada; son frère cadet est resté au Sri Lanka, où il vivrait dans le Nord sous la protection de prêtres catholiques. Les parents du demandeur habitent actuellement à Neervely, village du district de Jaffna où la famille résidait avant d'être déplacée pour la première fois en 1994.
[4]
Neervely a été occupé par les Tigres de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (les TLET) de 1990 à 1995. La famille du demandeur a éprouvé diverses difficultés pendant cette période et s'est vue obligée de déménager plusieurs fois en 1994 à cause de la guerre. Elle est retournée à Neervely en 1995, mais ses difficultés n'ont pas cessé pour autant.
[5]
Les problèmes particuliers au demandeur ont commencé en mars 2007, après qu'il eut achevé ses études et travaillé à la ferme familiale durant plusieurs années. Il a alors été arrêté, mis en détention et battu par l'armée sri-lankaise (l'ASL), qui le soupçonnait d'appartenir aux TLET. Il a été relâché sur l'intervention de sa mère, à condition de se présenter journellement au poste militaire et de s'engager à dénoncer à l'ASL tout membre des TLET dont il apprendrait la présence au village. Après deux jours, l'ASL l'a dispensé de l'obligation de se présenter au poste.
[6]
Pendant le mois d'avril 2007, l'ASL s'en est encore une fois prise au demandeur alors qu'il travaillait aux champs. Il affirme que les soldats l'ont battu et qu'ils l'auraient peut-être fusillé si sa mère n'était pas arrivée sur les entrefaites pour lui apporter à manger. Au cours de ce mois, il a été emmené plusieurs fois avec d'autres devant un homme masqué qui désignait les membres des TLET parmi eux; lui-même, cependant, a été chaque fois relâché.
[7]
Inquiet pour sa sécurité, le demandeur a formé le projet de quitter le village. Voyant qu'il ne pouvait obtenir de permis de déplacement pour lui-même, les membres de sa famille ont à leur tour demandé de tels permis, soi-disant pour se rendre en Inde. Cependant, la famille s'est en fin de compte retrouvée à Colombo en mai 2007. Elle avait l'intention d'y rester, mais elle s'y est d'abord logée provisoirement dans un gîte avec d'autres Tamouls.
[8]
L'un des frères du demandeur établis au Canada a alors proposé que la famille reste à Colombo et se fasse parrainer par lui. Cependant, les difficultés ont continué, du fait que la police contrôlait fréquemment l'identité des pensionnaires du gîte. À un moment donné, les policiers ont emmené les frères Suppaiah au commissariat avec d'autres jeunes Tamouls, les ont interrogés, leur ont ordonné de se déshabiller, et ne les ont relâchés qu'après que le propriétaire du gîte eut signé un formulaire de libération ou de nature similaire.
[9]
En juillet 2007, les policiers ont encore une fois emmené les frères Suppaiah et d'autres jeunes Tamouls au commissariat, leur ont dit qu'ils ne devraient pas séjourner à Colombo et les ont mis dans un autocar qui les a conduits à une école située à Vavuniya, dans le Nord du Sri Lanka. Les jeunes Tamouls ont été ramenés à Colombo le lendemain, mais la famille du demandeur est néanmoins partie peu après pour Vavuniya.
[10]
Bien qu'il eût d'abord craint de quitter la maison en raison des activités de groupes tamouls armés, notamment le Parti démocratique populaire de l'Eelam (l'EPDP), l'Organisation populaire de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (le PLOTE) et l'Organisation de libération de l'Eelam tamoul (la TELO), le demandeur a suivi un cours d'électricien de février à septembre 2008, faisant l'aller-retour quotidien entre l'école et chez lui dans la peur. Il a par la suite travaillé comme apprenti.
[11]
À partir de novembre 2008, l'EPDP a exigé de l'argent des Suppaiah sous la menace à trois reprises, mais il a en fin de compte cessé de les harceler lorsqu'ils lui eurent expliqué qu'ils n'en avaient pas puisqu'ils avaient été déplacés.
[12]
Comme ils craignaient de le voir enlever ou arrêter par l'ASL après la fin de la guerre en mai 2009 et que la demande canadienne de parrainage était encore à l'examen, les parents du demandeur ont décidé de l'envoyer séparément au Canada avec l'aide d'un agent. Ils n'avaient pas les moyens d'y envoyer leurs deux fils. Le demandeur a donc quitté Vavuniya le 11 février 2010 pour arriver au Canada le 3 juin de la même année après être passé par Dubaï, la Russie, Cuba, l'Équateur, le Belize, le Guatemala, le Mexique et les États-Unis.
[13]
Selon une lettre du père du demandeur datée du 31 mars 2012, des militants de l'EPDP se sont présentés chez les Suppaiah après que le demandeur eut quitté le Sri Lanka, ont menacé leur fils resté au pays, et ont exigé la remise de tout leur argent et de tous leurs bijoux. Bien que les Suppaiah eurent versé ce qu'on leur avait exigé, les hommes armés ont réclamé plus d'argent, qu'ils ont ordonné au couple d'obtenir de ses enfants établis à l'étranger. Ils ont dit aux Suppaiah qu'ils reviendraient et leur ont défendu de signaler ce qui était arrivé à la police ou aux médias. Lorsque ces hommes ont téléphoné pour exiger de nouveau de l'argent en menaçant le fils resté au Sri Lanka, ses parents l'ont envoyé se cacher chez des prêtres catholiques. Les parents ont d'abord habité chez des amis, puis ils sont rentrés à Neervely après qu'on eut cassé les vitres de leur maison à Vavuniya.
[14]
Lors d'une visite à ses parents à Neervely, des militants de l'EPDP ont reconnu le jeune Suppaiah, l'ont poursuivi, et n'ont abandonné leur poursuite qu'après qu'il fut heurté par une voiture et eut éveillé l'attention autour d'eux. Craignant pour sa sécurité, les prêtres catholiques l'ont envoyé au siège de leur communauté, situé dans le Nord, où il continue de sentir sa vie menacée.
[15]
Le père explique dans sa lettre qu'il n'a pas informé le demandeur de ces faits au moment même parce qu'il ne voulait pas lui causer d'inquiétudes.
La décision contrôlée
[16]
Le commissaire conclut que le demandeur n'a pas qualité de « réfugié au sens de la Convention » sous le régime de l'article 96 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), ni celle de « personne à protéger » sous le régime de son paragraphe 97(1). Il prend acte que le demandeur motive sa demande d'asile par la crainte fondée d'être persécuté en tant que jeune Tamoul de sexe masculin du Nord du Sri Lanka, par les opinions politiques qu'on lui attribue - c'est-à-dire par le fait d'être perçu comme un sympathisant ou un membre des TLET - et par sa nationalité.
[17]
Dans sa récapitulation des allégations du demandeur, le commissaire fait observer que ce dernier « a vécu sans problèmes [à Vavuniya à partir de 2007] jusqu'à son départ pour le Canada en février 2010 » (paragraphe 4 de la décision contrôlée). Bien que la transcription de l'audience révèle que le demandeur a contesté ce point de vue, arguant de ce que la famille avait eu des démêlés avec l'EPDP à Vavuniya (dossier du tribunal, page 590), il a convenu avec le commissaire qu'il avait pu étudier et travailler comme apprenti durant son séjour dans cette localité. Cependant, son frère cadet n'était pas alors autorisé à aller à l'école, et leur père ne travaillait pas parce que cela aurait été dangereux.
[18]
Malgré sa conclusion selon laquelle le demandeur a vécu à Vavuniya sans problèmes, le commissaire reconnaît que la situation n'était pas stable et que la famille a été victime à trois reprises de tentatives d'extorsion par des militants de l'EPDP. Il fait toutefois remarquer que le harcèlement a cessé lorsque les parents eurent expliqué qu'ils étaient des personnes déplacées.
[19]
Le commissaire note que le demandeur n'a jamais eu de liens avec les TLET et que l'ASL ne l'aurait pas relâché aux diverses occasions où il affirme avoir été mis en détention si elle l'avait considéré comme un membre de cette organisation. Le demandeur a reconnu à l'audience, constate également le commissaire, que l'ASL n'aurait jamais délivré un permis autorisant sa famille à se rendre en Inde si elle l'avait pris pour un membre des TLET.
[20]
Le commissaire rappelle que le demandeur et son frère ont été relâchés sans autres conséquences chaque fois qu'ils ont été incarcérés à Colombo, et que le demandeur détenait entre juillet 2007 et février 2010 une carte d'identité qui lui a permis de travailler à Vavuniya. Le demandeur n'a jamais été mis en détention ni interrogé pendant cette période, alors qu'on arrêtait les membres et sympathisants présumés des TLET, en particulier après la fin de la guerre. Enfin, note le commissaire, le demandeur a été autorisé à quitter le Sri Lanka en février 2010 sur la foi de son propre passeport.
[21]
Se fondant sur ce qui précède, le commissaire conclut que non seulement le demandeur n'est pas lié aux TLET, mais que l'ASL est également convaincue qu'il ne l'est pas. Exception faite des personnes soupçonnées de liens avec les TLET, fait observer le commissaire, la vie des Tamouls s'est améliorée depuis que cette organisation a déposé les armes en mai 2009. Il cite un document du Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (le HCR) daté de 2010 qui analyse ces progrès et selon lequel toutes les demandes d'asile de Tamouls sri-lankais peuvent de nouveau être appréciées individuellement. Ce document énumère certains profils qui exigent encore un examen particulièrement attentif, mais les jeunes Tamouls ne comptent pas parmi ces groupes. Le commissaire écrit ce qui suit:
Le demandeur d'asile a été victime de harcèlement parce qu'il était un jeune Tamoul, mais les actes du gouvernement au cours de la guerre civile n'appuient pas la conclusion selon laquelle il serait perçu aujourd'hui comme une personne ayant des liens avec les TLET.
[22]
Le commissaire conclut que le demandeur ne correspond pas au profil des personnes qu'on soupçonnerait d'avoir des liens avec les TLET (profil défini dans les lignes directrices du HCR comme encore soumis à risque) et que, suivant la prépondérance des probabilités, il n'y a pas de possibilité sérieuse qu'il soit persécuté au Sri Lanka.
[23]
Pour ce qui concerne la crainte du demandeur de se voir enlever par des membres de l'EPDP, étayée par la lettre de son père et exprimée dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) mis à jour, le commissaire déclare mettre « en doute la crédibilité de cette mise à jour » (paragraphe 13 de la décision contrôlée), étant donné que selon sa demande d'asile, formée en juin 2010, ses parents vivaient déjà à Neervely et que, suivant son FRP, signé en juillet de la même année, son frère y habitait aussi. Percevant des contradictions dans les modifications apportées par le demandeur à son FRP, le commissaire conclut qu'il n'aurait pas été en mesure de déclarer que sa famille vivait déjà à Neervely si les allégations contenues dans la lettre de son père étaient vraies.
[24]
Étant donné son appréciation de la crédibilité de la lettre, le commissaire a conclu que les parents du demandeur, et son frère aussi très probablement, habitaient à Neervely depuis environ deux ans, et qu'aucun élément ne tendait à établir qu'ils aient fait l'objet de menaces ou de harcèlement de la part de militants de l'EPDP.
[25]
Pour ce qui concerne l'affirmation du demandeur selon laquelle tout le monde est menacé par l'EPDP, le commissaire cite des éléments de preuve donnant à penser que cette organisation ne prend pour cibles que les personnes soupçonnées d'appuyer les TLET ou de se battre dans leurs rangs, de sorte qu'elle ne constituerait pas un risque pour le demandeur. Le commissaire invoque un deuxième document, émanant du haut-commissariat du Royaume-Uni à Colombo, selon lequel les déclarations d'un policier et d'un fonctionnaire sri-lankais établissent que les groupes paramilitaires n'opèrent plus à Jaffna ou ne constituent plus un problème sérieux. Il cite ensuite plusieurs documents décrivant les activités en cours de l'EPDP, mais conclut qu'aucun élément de preuve ne laisse supposer que cette organisation mettrait le demandeur individuellement en danger, en particulier si l'on considère que, même dans l'hypothèse où serait constatée l'existence d'un risque d'extorsion, celui-ci constituerait un risque général.
Les questions en litige
[26]
La présente demande soulève trois questions principales:
i) La Commission a-t-elle fait une erreur en omettant de prendre en considération les documents les plus récents sur la situation au Sri Lanka?
ii) La décision du commissaire est-elle raisonnable étant donné le choix qu'il a fait de n'accorder aucun poids au FRP mis à jour du demandeur ni aux renseignements communiqués par le père de ce dernier?
iii) Le commissaire s'est-il trompé en omettant d'apprécier l'argument de l'avocate du demandeur selon lequel celui-ci courrait un risque au Sri Lanka en tant que rapatrié?
Analyse
[27]
Comme le rappelle le demandeur, la norme de contrôle applicable aux conclusions de fait et aux conclusions sur la crédibilité est celle du caractère raisonnable; voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 20. Il est maintenant de droit constant que le caractère raisonnable tient à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de ladite décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit; voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 47.
[28]
Le demandeur soutient que le fait pour le commissaire de ne pas avoir apprécié ses observations sur le risque qu'il courrait au Sri Lanka en tant que rapatrié constitue un manquement à la justice naturelle, qui porte atteinte à son droit à une audition équitable. Cette position ne me paraît pas défendable au vu des faits de l'espèce. Il est très probable que la Commission n'a pas examiné explicitement cet argument dans ses motifs parce qu'elle l'a implicitement jugé mal fondé. Cette conclusion est une question de fait et de crédibilité, tout comme les deux autres points que le demandeur met en litige.
i) La Commission a-t-elle fait une erreur en omettant de prendre en considération les documents les plus récents sur la situation au Sri Lanka?
[29]
Le demandeur soutient que le commissaire a fait une erreur fondamentale dans son analyse de la situation au Sri Lanka en se fondant exclusivement sur le document du HCR de 2010 et en ne tenant pas compte de documents plus récents sur cette situation. Se basant lui-même sur trois Réponses à des demandes d'information datées de juillet et d'août 2011, le demandeur avance que, contrairement aux conclusions du commissaire, la situation au Sri Lanka se détériore en fait, et que l'on constate de nouveau des meurtres et des disparitions parmi les jeunes Tamouls du Nord de sexe masculin. Le demandeur a aussi produit un choix volumineux d'articles portant sur des meurtres et des enlèvements de jeunes gens de cette catégorie. Enfin, le demandeur cite dans son mémoire complémentaire la décision de fraîche date
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), où le juge Martineau a estimé déraisonnable une conclusion fondée sur le document susdit du HCR, étant donné la preuve documentaire plus récente dont on disposait au moment de l'audience. À ce même sujet, le demandeur a produit en pièces complémentaires une décision de la SPR favorable à un demandeur d'asile sri-lankais et une décision d'examen des risques avant renvoi, favorable aussi, concernant un demandeur de même nationalité.
[30]
Je conviens avec l'avocate du demandeur que la non-prise en considération d'éléments de preuve substantielle par un tribunal administratif constitue une erreur donnant lieu à révision et que la Commission est tenue de mentionner les éléments de preuve importants relatifs à la situation du pays d'origine qui contredisent ses conclusions finales; voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1re inst.). Cependant, l'examen attentif des éléments de preuve documentaire récents produits par le demandeur ne me convainc pas que la Commission a commis une erreur en n'y faisant pas référence.
[31]
Premièrement, comme le rappelle le défendeur, le commissaire a en fait cité des éléments de preuve plus récents que le document du HCR aux paragraphes 14 et 15 de sa décision, et il a lui-même versé au dossier un ensemble de documents daté du 9 février 2012 au début de l'audience de la demande d'asile. Reconnaissant que la situation au Sri Lanka fluctue continuellement, il a déclaré avoir examiné certaines parties de cette documentation et décidé qu'elle devrait figurer au dossier.
[32]
Deuxièmement, chose plus importante, la décision de la Commission se fonde principalement sur la conclusion que les autorités sri-lankaises ne soupçonnent pas le demandeur d'appartenir aux TLET. La Commission a induit cette conclusion des constatations suivantes: le demandeur a été relâché chaque fois qu'il avait été arrêté et mis en détention; lui-même et sa famille ont pu obtenir des permis de sortie les autorisant à se rendre en Inde; il détenait une carte d'identité qui lui a permis de travailler à Vavuniya de juillet 2007 à février 2010; il n'a été ni mis en détention ni interrogé à la fin de la guerre, alors qu'on arrêtait les personnes soupçonnées d'être des membres ou des sympathisants des TLET; et il a pu quitter le Sri Lanka en février 2010 en utilisant son propre passeport. Il était raisonnablement permis à la Commission de conclure de ces faits que le demandeur n'était pas soupçonné de militer pour les TLET.
[33]
La lecture attentive des trois Réponses à des demandes d'information produites par le demandeur en pièces annexées à son affidavit complémentaire ne permet pas de conclure que les personnes non soupçonnées d'appartenir aux TLET risquent plus qu'une simple possibilité de persécution. Les Sri-Lankais d'ethnie tamoule, en particulier les hommes de 18 à 35 ans, paraissent hélas faire encore fréquemment l'objet de harcèlement, de préjugés et même de discrimination dans leur pays. La première RDI, datée du 12 juillet 2011 (LKA103782.E), signale un accroissement, depuis février 2011, des activités de surveillance, d'arrestation et d'incarcération de Tamouls soupçonnés d'être des membres ou des sympathisants des TLET. La deuxième RDI, datée du 22 août 2011 (LKA103816.E), indique que l'obligation pour les Tamouls de s'enregistrer aux postes de police a été rétablie en juillet dans diverses parties de Colombo. Le troisième de ces documents, daté du 15 août 2011 (LKA103784.E), examine les voies de recours ouvertes aux Tamouls de Jaffna qui ont été victimes d'atteintes aux droits de la personne et les difficultés auxquelles doit faire face la Commission des droits de la personne du Sri Lanka. Aucun de ces documents n'entame la validité des conclusions consignées dans les lignes directrices du HCR de 2010, selon lesquelles toutes les demandes d'asile doivent faire l'objet d'une appréciation individuelle et que les risques que pourraient courir les personnes présentant des profils déterminés (dont le demandeur ne correspond à aucun) exigent un examen particulièrement attentif.
[34]
Le demandeur a soutenu devant la CISR qu'il courrait encore un risque s'il rentrait au Sri Lanka parce qu'il pourrait être pris pour cible sur le soupçon d'avoir des liens avec les TLET. Cet argument, sans autres précisions, pèche manifestement par insuffisance. Comme l'a écrit la juge Tremblay-Lamer au paragraphe 20 de
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Pour bénéficier de la protection du Canada en vertu de l'article 97 de la LIPR, le demandeur doit démontrer l'existence probable d'un risque personnalisé et qu'il s'agit d'un risque auquel d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne sont généralement pas exposées: voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 222 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 143 (QL). Le simple fait d'être un jeune homme tamoul de l'est du Sri Lanka ne constitue pas un risque personnalisé. Le tribunal a trouvé que les actes de la SLA envers le demandeur semblent toujours avoir été instigués par le groupe
Pillaiyan
, et qu'il a pu obtenir un passeport sri lankais et sortir du pays, et ce, malgré le fait que les Tamouls du nord et de l'est font l'objet d'une attention accrue de la part des autorités. En tenant compte de cela, et en considérant qu'il n'a jamais été associé au TLET et que le gouvernement sri lankais a libéré des milliers de cadres du TLET, le tribunal a conclu que l'intérêt des autorités sri lankaises envers le demandeur, s'il y en a, est minime et qu'il n'existe qu'une simple possibilité qu'il soit persécuté à Trincomalee ou dans le reste du pays. Je suis d'avis que la décision du tribunal appartient aux issues possibles acceptables.
[35]
Je pense comme le défendeur que les décisions favorables de la SPR et d'un agent d'ERAR touchant d'autres demandeurs d'asile sri-lankais qu'invoque le demandeur ne lui sont d'aucun secours. Il est absolument dépourvu de pertinence, s'agissant du caractère raisonnable de la décision attaquée, que des tribunaux administratifs différents saisis de faits différents aient décidé en faveur des demandeurs d'asile. Rappelons en outre que la norme de contrôle applicable est celle du caractère raisonnable et non celle de la décision correcte. Il n'est pas pertinent qu'un autre décideur ait statué différemment sur une autre demande, même formée par un parent du demandeur, parce qu'il existe dans la plupart des cas plusieurs issues possibles acceptables, plutôt qu'une seule correcte.
[36]
Enfin, la présente espèce se distingue de l'affaire qui a donné lieu à la décision du juge Martineau dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée. Premièrement, il apparaît que la décision contrôlée dans cette affaire ne faisait que deux pages et que l'un des motifs principaux invoqués pour la contester était que la SPR avait omis d'effectuer une analyse approfondie et détaillée des éléments de preuve tendant à établir des changements fondamentaux dans la situation du Sri Lanka. Le juge Martineau a conclu que, effectivement, les éléments de preuve documentaire examinés par la SPR et cités dans la décision attaquée avaient été « choisis » très sélectivement et « analysés très rapidement » (paragraphe 17). Or je ne pense pas qu'on puisse dire de même de la décision ici contrôlée. Celle-ci est exhaustive et bien motivée, et, comme je le disais plus haut, le commissaire s'est appuyé sur un bon nombre de documents relatifs à la situation du Sri Lanka, dont l'un ne date que de février 2012. Qui plus est, le demandeur dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> paraît avoir été relâché plus d'une fois contre le paiement d'un pot-de-vin, ce qui n'est pas le cas de l'auteur de la demande ici considérée. Pour tous ces motifs, je conclus que l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> se distingue nettement de la présente espèce.
ii) La décision du commissaire est-elle raisonnable étant donné le choix qu'il a fait de n'accorder aucun poids au FRP mis à jour du demandeur ni aux renseignements communiqués par le père de ce dernier?
[37]
Le demandeur fait valoir, en réponse à la conclusion du commissaire sur la crédibilité de la lettre de son père, qu'il savait au moment de son arrivée au Canada que sa famille avait quitté Vavuniya pour rentrer à Neervely, mais qu'il ignorait pourquoi et n'avait aucune raison de penser que son frère ne s'y trouverait pas avec eux. Selon le demandeur, cette conclusion du commissaire manifeste une compréhension entièrement erronée de la preuve.
[38]
La Commission avait le droit de comparer le FRP d'origine et sa version modifiée, et d'induire de cette comparaison que le demandeur avait essayé d'enjoliver son récit. Il s'agit là d'une question de crédibilité, que le commissaire était beaucoup mieux placé pour trancher que ne l'est la Cour.
[39]
En outre, le demandeur n'a pas établi que les éléments écartés par le commissaire auraient suffi à changer sa conclusion. Les allégations rejetées mettaient en rapport la persécution du frère du demandeur avec les activités d'extorsion de l'EPDP et non avec une quelconque conclusion ou hypothèse selon laquelle le frère aurait des liens avec les TLET. Le demandeur n'a pas prouvé qu'il était déraisonnable de la part du commissaire d'avoir conclu que l'extorsion par l'EPDP constitue un risque général au Sri Lanka, pas plus qu'il n'a réfuté l'argument du défendeur selon lequel l'ampleur de la criminalité dans le pays d'origine d'un demandeur d'asile ne suffit pas en soi à établir la persécution; voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 33. Par conséquent, le demandeur n'a pas démontré que, même dans le cas où la Cour conclurait que le commissaire a fait une erreur en refusant de prendre en considération les modifications de son FPR, une telle erreur serait décisive ou permettrait de tenir pour déraisonnable la décision finale dudit commissaire.
iii) Le commissaire s'est-il trompé en omettant d'apprécier l'argument de l'avocate du demandeur selon lequel celui-ci courrait un risque au Sri Lanka en tant que rapatrié?
[40]
Dans les derniers paragraphes de ses observations, l'avocate du demandeur affirme que le commissaire s'est trompé en omettant d'effectuer une analyse du risque auquel son client serait exposé au Sri Lanka en tant que rapatrié. Elle rappelle avoir soulevé cette question dans les dernières observations qu'elle a présentées à l'audience et y avoir explicitement fait référence à un rapport du groupe britannique
Freedom from Torture
, qui expose de multiples cas de torture de rapatriés sri-lankais, dont un bon nombre ne présentaient pas de profil particulier. Elle soutient que le fait pour le commissaire d'avoir passé ces arguments sous silence constitue une erreur donnant lieu à révision, ainsi qu'une violation de la justice naturelle qui porte atteinte au droit du demandeur à une audition équitable.
[41]
Encore une fois, je pense comme le défendeur que la Commission ne s'est pas trompée en n'analysant pas ce risque. Le demandeur n'a pas déclaré dans son FRP qu'il serait menacé en tant que rapatrié, pas plus qu'il n'a témoigné à l'audience sur cette question. Le fait que son avocate ait mentionné en passant un document donné dans les observations orales qu'elle a présentées à la fin de l'audience ne déclenchait pas pour la Commission l'obligation d'examiner ce nouveau motif de persécution dans sa décision. S'il est vrai que l'omission de prendre en considération un motif complémentaire de persécution peut porter un coup fatal à la décision de la Commission, je conviens avec le juge Near (qui siège maintenant à la Cour d'appel) que tel n'est pas le cas lorsque ce motif est invoqué après coup, sans être étayé par la preuve, plutôt que de constituer l'un des éléments fondamentaux de la demande d'asile; voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphes 14 à 19.
[42]
En outre, le rapport de
Freedom from Torture
, bien qu'il expose les cas de 35 victimes de torture au Sri Lanka dont 14 ont passé un certain temps à l'étranger avant d'être expulsées vers ce pays, ne dit pas que les personnes expulsées vers le Sri Lanka y soient systématiquement mises en détention et torturées; au contraire, il précise que toutes les victimes ont déclaré avoir été prises pour cibles en raison de liens réels ou supposés avec les TLET (dossier du tribunal, page 409). On peut lire aussi ce qui suit dans la conclusion de ce même document: [TRADUCTION] « Les éléments médico-légaux réunis par
Freedom from Torture
établissent que, malgré la cessation officielle des hostilités, les Tamouls ayant des liens réels ou supposés avec les TLET restent exposés à un risque particulier de détention et de torture au Sri Lanka » (dossier du tribunal, page 430).
[43]
Comme le commissaire a conclu que les autorités sri-lankaises ne pensaient pas sérieusement que le demandeur appartienne aux TLET ou ait un lien quelconque avec eux, on ne peut induire du document de
Freedom from Torture
qu'il serait exposé à un risque plus grand du fait qu'il rentrerait au Sri Lanka en tant que rapatrié.

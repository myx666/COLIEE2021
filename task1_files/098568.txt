[1]
Martineau, J.
[Translation]: The applicants are challenging the legality of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) dated October 6, 2005, concluding that the applicants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection
Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act).
[2]
The applicants-Mr. Chavez, his wife, his two daughters, his father and the father's spouse-are citizens of Mexico. They fear being persecuted because of their political opinion and their membership in a particular social group, namely, the family.
[3]
In his Personal Information Form (PIF), the principal applicant based his claim primarily on the following facts. He is a lawyer. Together with his father, he previously operated a security company in the city of Toluca, Mexico. Between 1998 and 2002, the company was awarded contracts by the office of the attorney general of the republic (PGR) for surveillance at the Adolfo Lopez Mateos international airport. On March 3, 2003, in Mexico City, he was abducted by unknown persons who forced him to get in their automobile. From [translation] "the way they talked to each other", he concluded that they were officers of the judicial police. The kidnappers telephoned his father and demanded a ransom of one million pesos. Having collected half of that amount, his father managed to convince the kidnappers to free his son. The principal applicant and his father decided not to file a complaint with the police, as that could endanger the lives of the principal applicant and his family. The principal applicant shut down his business and went into practice as a lawyer.
[4]
Nearly two years later, on January 12, 2005, the spouse of the principal applicant's father was in Mexico City. She was followed by two unknown persons in a white automobile. She managed to escape by hiding in a security guard booth. On January 14, 2005, the principal applicant received a telephone call. The person calling said, [translation] "We know where you live" and hung up. After discussing the matter with colleagues, the principal applicant decided to leave the country. On January 17, 2005, the principal applicant and his family applied for their passports. On February 1, while driving to Toluca after having purchased their airline tickets in Mexico City, the principal applicant and his spouse were followed by a white automobile. An unknown person pulled out a weapon and told them to get out. In shock, the principal applicant lost control. As a result of this accident, the principal applicant and his spouse were hospitalized. The principal applicant remained at home for 15 days to recover. On March 21, 2005, the applicants arrived in Canada and claimed refugee protection.
[5]
In its decision, the Board mistakenly stated that the applicants were citizens of Peru. However, aside from this strictly clerical error, the determinative issue in this case is the credibility of the applicants.
[6]
First of all, the Board noted a contradiction between the immigration officer's interview sheet (notes made at the port of entry) for the principal applicant and his testimony. The interview sheet indicates that the March 3, 2003 kidnapping happened when the principal applicant was leaving the bank. However, at the hearing, the principal applicant testified that he was leaving the office of the attorney general. When confronted with this contradiction, the principal applicant confirmed the latest version of the facts and insisted this was what he had told the immigration officer. The Board was of the opinion that this was a major contradiction which affected his credibility. It rejected the principal applicant's explanation, noting that it is "too easy to pass the blame on to a third party".
[7]
Secondly, the Board drew a negative inference from the fact that, after the principal applicant was kidnapped in March 2003, the applicants waited two years before leaving Mexico. The Board noted that the principal applicant was ill at ease when confronted on this point.
[8]
Thirdly, in the principal applicant's PIF, there is no mention of an attempted kidnapping on February 1, 2005, but rather of armed persons in an automobile who allegedly threatened him and tried to stop his automobile. When confronted with this omission, which the Board considered as being important, the principal applicant answered: [translation] "I was not kidnapped, because I did not allow it, and that is why I had the accident". The Board did not believe the principal applicant and was of the opinion that he trimmed his testimony to explain this omission.
[9]
Fourthly, the Board did not believe the principal applicant's explanation to the effect that he deduced that his kidnappers were judicial police officers because of [translation] "the way they talked to each other". The Board was of the opinion this was "pure speculation and improvisation". In fact, the principal applicant was unable to give any details whatsoever about the content of the conversations of his attackers (apart from making a baseless statement at the hearing that judicial police officers use "codes" when speaking to each other). The Board also noted that in his Background Information form, in answer to Question 3(d), he stated that he fears unknown people. When confronted with this contradiction, the applicant simply answered, [translation] "No, he asked me if I knew judicial police officers, and I said no". The Board concluded that the principal applicant trimmed his testimony. The Board did note that the father of the principal applicant testified to the effect that his son's abductors were officers of the judicial police because of the way they spoke, but it did not believe this explanation for the abovementioned reasons.
[10]
Fifthly, even though it did not believe the applicants' narratives were true, the Board dealt briefly with state protection. It noted that the government of Mexico had taken steps to fight police corruption and criticized the applicants for not having contacted "other institutions of the Mexican government" to ask for their country's protection. The Board deduced that the applicants did not fear for their lives and that the alleged incidents simply did not occur.
[11]
Essentially, the applicants submit today that the Board erred in its assessment of the facts. They challenge each of the unfavourable conclusions mentioned above, submitting that those conclusions are arbitrary and unreasonable. The contradictions noted by the Board are only apparent ones, and the explanations given by the principal applicant are reasonable in the circumstances. Thus, the immigration officer simply made a mistake in writing down that the principal applicant was leaving the bank when he was kidnapped. In addition, the second attempted kidnapping actually is mentioned in the PIF, although the word "kidnapping" is not used. Counsel for the applicants also note that the principal applicant is a lawyer. He and his family had a lot to lose in leaving Mexico. Therefore, their fear of persecution is real and well founded. In any event, even if there are inconsistencies in the applicants' evidence, they are relatively minor. Finally, the applicants submit that the Board erred in its assessment of state protection available in Mexico, particularly in cases of police corruption, and that this is a reviewable error:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[12]
Meanwhile, the respondent submits that the case law holds that the Board may consider the port of entry notes to assess the credibility of an applicant (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and the case law cited in this decision). It is unusual, to say the least, that the only so-called error mentioned by the applicants concerns the fact that the immigration officer mistakenly wrote that the principal applicant was leaving a bank when he was kidnapped by judicial police officers. The attempted kidnapping in 2005 is not mentioned in the PIF, which recounts another incident. Therefore, the Board had good reason to draw a negative inference. Moreover, the Board noted that the applicant appeared ill at ease when he gave his answers. Such findings are an integral part of the Board's discretion and must be afforded considerable deference. The Board could also take into consideration the long delay in leaving Mexico after the applicant was allegedly kidnapped. In addition, the Board noted that the Mexican authorities had established a system to fight police corruption and that state protection was available to the applicants. This is not a case in which a refugee protection claimant filed a complaint and then faced official inaction. Therefore, no intervention is warranted:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[13]
This application must be dismissed. It is obvious that the Board's assessment of the applicants' credibility is based on the evidence on record. Because this is a finding of fact, the applicable standard is patent unreasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). To sum up, the Court will intervene only if the Board based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it (paragraph 18.1(4)(
d
) of the
Federal Courts Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7), which is not the case here. In fact, even if an analysis of the documents and answers of the principal applicant may to a certain extent support the interpretation suggested by counsel for the applicants, the opposite is also true. As far as the assessment of facts is concerned, the Board is usually in a better position to reach conclusions than the Court.
[14]
I hasten to add that it is nevertheless dangerous for the Board to base a finding of an overall lack of credibility on a minor omission or an apparent contradiction between the port of entry notes and the subsequent testimony of a claimant for refugee protection. As I wrote in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
. . . not every kind of inconsistency or implausibility in the applicant's evidence will reasonably support the Board's negative findings on overall credibility. It would not be proper for the Board to base its findings on extensive "microscopic" examination of issues irrelevant or peripheral to the applicant's claim: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (C.A.) ("
Owusu-Ansah
")
. . .
Furthermore, the Board should not be quick to apply the North American logic and reasoning to the claimant's behaviour: consideration should be given to the claimant's age, cultural background and previous social experiences: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 20 (QL) (T.D.); and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (T.D.) . . . .
A person's first story is usually the most genuine and, therefore, the one to be most believed. That being said, although the failure to report a fact can be a cause for concern, it should not always be so. That, again depends on all the circumstances: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 5 (QL) (C.A.);
Owusu- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (T.D.). In evaluating the applicant's first encounters with Canadian immigration authorities or referring to the applicant's Port of Entry Statements, the Board should also be mindful of the fact that "most refugees have lived experiences in their country of origin which give them good reason to distrust persons in authority": see Prof. James C. Hathaway,
The Law of Refugee Status
, (Toronto: Butterworth, 1991) at 84-85; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra; and
Takhar
, supra.
. . .
There is no doubt that a failure to mention the key events on which the refugee claim is based in a written statement to immigration authorities, or an inconsistency between such statement and subsequent testimony, are very serious matters that can potentially sustain a negative credibility finding. However, the omission or inconsistency must be real: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (C.A.). Besides, explanations given by the applicant which are not obviously implausible must be taken into account: see
Owusu- <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[15]
In my opinion, the Board's finding of an overall lack of credibility is not patently unreasonable. In the case at bar, the Board took into consideration the explanations given by the principal applicant and rejected them, giving reasons which do not seem to me to be perverse or capricious. The contradiction between the port of entry notes and the principal applicant's testimony are quite real and is not the only one noted by the Board in its decision. There is no reason here to doubt the truth and the accuracy of the statements made by the principal applicant to the immigration officer. Moreover, I note that the principal applicant is an educated man and a lawyer. It is therefore reasonable to expect him to be able to give the immigration officer and the Board a clear explanation of his reasons for leaving Mexico. Finally, this is not a case in which the evidence on record shows that real prejudice was caused to the claimant for refugee protection because of flagrant mistakes in interpretation made by an interpreter at the hearing or at the initial interview with the immigration officer.
[16]
In conclusion, it is not my function to substitute my assessment of the evidence for that of the Board. Furthermore, there is no need for me to rule on the legality of the Board's conclusion about state protection, given that the applicants' narratives were found to be not credible and that this aspect of the Board's decision is not subject to review. No question of general importance was raised or is raised in the case at bar.
ORDER

THE COURT ORDERS that
the application for judicial review be dismissed. No question is certified.

Alejandro Julia Nava Chavez, Alejandra Cortes Alvarez, Alexa Fernanda Nava Cortes, Mariana Nava Cortes, Urbano Nava Gamito and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  contestent la légalité d’une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l’immigration et du statut de réfugié (la Commission) rendue le 6 octobre 2005 et concluant que les demandeurs n’ont pas la qualité de réfugiés au sens de la Convention ni celle de personnes à protéger selon les articles 96 et 97 de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés, L.C. 2001, c. 27 (la Loi).
[2]
Les demandeurs - M. Chavez, son épouse, ses deux filles, son père et la conjointe de son père - sont citoyens du Mexique. Ils craignent d’être persécutés en raison de leurs opinions politiques et de leur appartenance à un groupe social, à savoir, la famille.
[3]
Dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP), le demandeur principal se fonde principalement sur les faits qui suivent. Celui-ci est avocat. Auparavant, il exploitait avec son père une entreprise de sécurité dans la ville de Toluca au Mexique. De 1998 à 2002, l’entreprise obtient des contrats avec le bureau du Procureur général de la République (PGR) visant la surveillance à l’aéroport international Adolfo Lopez Mateos. Le 3 mars 2003, à Mexico, il est enlevé par des inconnus qui le forcent à monter dans leur voiture. Par leur « façon de parler entre eux », il en déduit qu’il s’agit d’agents de la police judiciaire. Les ravisseurs téléphonent à son père et exigent une rançon d’un million de pesos. Ayant réussi à amasser la moitié de cette somme, son père parvient à convaincre les ravisseurs de libérer son fils. Le demandeur principal et son père décident de ne pas porter plainte, car une dénonciation à la police pourrait mettre la vie du demandeur principal et de sa famille en danger. Le demandeur principal ferme son entreprise et se met à pratiquer le droit.
[4]
Près de deux ans plus tard, le 12 janvier 2005, la conjointe du père du demandeur principal est à Mexico; elle est alors suivie par une voiture dans laquelle se retrouvent deux inconnus. Elle réussit à s’enfuir en se réfugiant dans une cabine de garde de surveillance. Le 14 janvier 2005, le demandeur principal reçoit un coup de téléphone. La personne à l’autre bout du fil lui dit : « Nous savons où est-ce que vous vivez » et raccroche. Après en avoir discuté avec des collègues, le demandeur principal décide de quitter le pays. Le 17 janvier 2005, le demandeur principal et sa famille font des démarches pour obtenir leurs passeports. Le 1er février, en route vers Toluca après avoir acheté des billets d’avion à Mexico, le demandeur principal et son épouse sont suivis par une voiture blanche. Un inconnu sort une arme et leur dit de sortir. Sous le choc, le demandeur principal perd le contrôle. Suite à cet accident, son épouse et lui sont hospitalisés. Le demandeur principal demeure chez lui pour 15 jours afin de se remettre. Le 21 mars 2005, les demandeurs arrivent au Canada et réclament le statut de réfugié.
[5]
Dans sa décision, la Commission affirme erronément que les demandeurs sont des citoyens du Pérou. Toutefois, en marge de cette erreur purement cléricale, la question déterminante en l’espèce est celle de la crédibilité des demandeurs.
[6]
Premièrement, la Commission relève une contradiction entre la fiche d’entrevue de l’agent d’immigration (notes au point d’entrée) du demandeur principal et son témoignage. La fiche d’entrevue indique que l’enlèvement du 3 mars 2003 a eu lieu lorsqu’il sortait de la banque. Or, lors de l’audience, le demandeur principal témoigne qu’il sortait du bureau du Procureur général. Confronté à cette contradiction, le demandeur principal confirme cette dernière version des faits et insiste que c’est bien ce qu’il a dit à l’agent d’immigration. La Commission considère qu’il s’agit d’une contradiction majeure qui affecte sa crédibilité. Elle rejette l’explication fournie par le demandeur principal et souligne qu’il est « trop facile de jeter le blâme sur une tierce personne ».
[7]
Deuxièmement, la Commission tire une inférence négative du fait que les demandeurs ont attendu deux ans pour quitter le Mexique après l’enlèvement du demandeur principal qui aurait eu lieu en mars 2003. La Commission note que le demandeur principal était mal à l’aise lorsqu’elle l’a confronté sur ce point.
[8]
Troisièmement, dans le FRP du demandeur principal, il n’est pas question d’une tentative d’enlèvement le 1er février 2005, mais plutôt de gens armés en voiture qui l’auraient menacé et qui auraient essayé d’arrêter sa voiture. Confronté à cette omission importante de l’avis de la Commission, le demandeur principal a répondu : « Je n’ai pas été enlevé, parce que je ne l’ai pas permis, c’est la raison pour laquelle j’ai eu l’accident ». La Commission ne croit pas le demandeur principal et estime qu’il ajuste son témoignage afin de justifier cette omission.
[9]
Quatrièmement, la Commission ne retient pas l’explication du demandeur principal selon laquelle il a déduit que ses ravisseurs étaient des agents de la police judiciaire par « leur façon de parler ». La Commission est d’avis qu’il s’agit de « pure spéculation et improvisation ». En effet, le demandeur principal a été incapable de fournir quelque détail que ce soit quant au contenu des conversations de ses agresseurs (sinon que d’affirmer gratuitement à l’audition que les policiers judiciaires utilisent des « codes » lorsqu’ils parlent entre eux). La Commission souligne aussi que dans sa Fiche de renseignements de base, à la question 3(d), le demandeur principal déclare qu’il craint « des inconnus ». Confronté à cette omission, le demandeur répond simplement : « Non, il m’avait demandé si je connaissais les policiers judiciaires et j’ai dit non ». La Commission conclut que le demandeur principal ajuste son témoignage. La Commission a bien noté que le père du demandeur principal a témoigné à l’effet que les ravisseurs de son fils étaient des agents de la police judiciaire à cause de leur « façon de parler », mais n’a pas retenu cette explication pour les raisons susmentionnées.
[10]
Cinquièmement, bien qu’elle n’ait pas cru en la véracité du récit des demandeurs, la Commission traite brièvement de la protection de l’État. Elle note que le gouvernement du Mexique a pris des mesures pour lutter contre la corruption des policiers et reproche aux demandeurs de ne pas s’être adressés à « d’autres institutions du gouvernement mexicain » afin de se prévaloir de la protection de leur pays. Elle en déduit que les demandeurs ne craignent pas pour leur vie et n’ont tout simplement pas vécu les incidents allégués.
[11]
En substance, les demandeurs font valoir aujourd’hui que la Commission a erré dans son évaluation des faits. Bref, ils attaquent chacune des conclusions défavorables relatées plus haut en soumettant que celles-ci sont arbitraires et déraisonnables. Les contradictions notées par la Commission ne sont qu’apparentes et les explications données par le demandeur principal sont raisonnables dans les circonstances. Ainsi, l’agent d’immigration s’est tout simplement trompé en inscrivant que celui-ci sortait de la banque lorsqu’il a été enlevé. De plus, la deuxième tentative d’enlèvement est bien mentionnée dans le FRP même si le mot « enlèvement » n’est pas utilisé dans le FRP. Le procureur des demandeurs fait également valoir que le demandeur principal est un avocat. Sa famille et lui-même avaient beaucoup à perdre en quittant le Mexique. Leur crainte de persécution est donc réelle et bien fondée. En tout état de cause, s’il existe des incohérences dans la preuve des demandeurs, celles-ci sont relativement mineures. Enfin, les demandeurs soutiennent que la Commission a erré dans son évaluation de la protection étatique disponible au Mexique, particulièrement lorsqu’il est question de corruption policière, ce qui constitue une erreur révisable :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[12]
Pour sa part, le défendeur soutient qu’il ressort de la jurisprudence que la Commission peut considérer les notes au point d’entrée afin d’apprécier la crédibilité d’un demandeur ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et jurisprudence citée dans cette dernière décision). Or, il est pour le moins curieux que la seule « erreur » relevée par les demandeurs a trait au fait que l’agent d’immigration aurait erronément inscrit que le demandeur principal sortait d’une banque lorsqu’il a été enlevé par des agents de la police judiciaire. La tentative d’enlèvement de 2005 n’est pas mentionnée au FRP, qui parle d’un autre incident. La Commission avait donc raison d’en tirer une inférence négative. De plus, la Commission a noté que le demandeur était mal à l’aise lorsqu’il donnait ses réponses. De telles conclusions font partie intégrante de la discrétion accordée à la Commission et doivent faire l’objet d’une grande retenue. La Commission pouvait également tenir compte du long délai à quitter le Mexique après le présumé enlèvement du demandeur. De surcroît, la Commission a noté que les autorités mexicaines ont mis sur place un système pour lutter contre la corruption policière et que la protection étatique était disponible aux demandeurs. Il ne s’agit pas d’un cas où un revendicateur d’asile porte plainte et se heurte ensuite à l’inaction des autorités. Il n’y a donc pas lieu d’intervenir en l’espèce :  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[13]
La présente demande doit être rejetée. Il est clair que l’évaluation faite par la Commission de la crédibilité des demandeurs repose sur la preuve au dossier. S’agissant ici d’une conclusion de fait, la norme applicable est celle de la décision manifestement déraisonnable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.)). En somme, la Cour n’interviendra que si la décision de la Commission est fondée sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans qu'il soit tenu compte des éléments dont elle disposait (alinéa 18.1 (4) d) de la Loi sur les Cours fédérales, L.R.C. 1985, c. F-7), ce qui n’est pas le cas en l’espèce. En effet, même si une analyse des documents et des réponses du demandeur principal peut appuyer, jusqu’à un certain point, l’interprétation suggérée par le procureur des demandeurs, l’inverse est également vrai. Or, en matière d’appréciation des faits, la Commission est normalement mieux placée que la Cour pour tirer des conclusions.
[14]
Je m’empresse d’ajouter qu’il est toutefois dangereux pour la Commission de fonder une conclusion générale d’absence de crédibilité sur une simple omission ou sur une contradiction apparente découlant des notes prises au point d’entrée et du témoignage ultérieur d’un revendicateur d’asile. Comme je l’ai écrit dans  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
Ce ne sont [...] pas tous les types d'incohérence ou d'invraisemblance contenue dans la preuve présentée par le demandeur qui justifieront raisonnablement que la Commission tire des conclusions défavorables sur la crédibilité en général. Il ne conviendrait pas que la Commission tire ses conclusions après avoir examiné « à la loupe » des éléments qui ne sont pas pertinents ou qui sont accessoires à la revendication du demandeur : voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (C.A.)
(Owusu-Ansah)
[...]
En outre, la Commission ne devrait pas s'empresser d'appliquer une logique et un raisonnement nord-américains à la conduite du revendicateur. Il faut tenir compte de l'âge, des antécédents culturels et des expériences sociales du revendicateur : voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au paragr. 20 (QL) (1re inst.);
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (1re inst.) […]
Le premier récit que fait une personne est généralement le plus fidèle et, de ce fait, celui auquel il faut ajouter le plus de foi. Cela étant dit, l'omission d'un fait, bien qu'elle puisse être préoccupante, ne devrait pas toujours l'être. Tout dépend encore une fois des circonstances : voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  au paragr. 5 (QL) (C.A.);
Owusu-Ansah, précité;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (1re inst.). Lorsqu'elle évalue les premiers rapports du demandeur avec les autorités canadiennes de l'Immigration ou qu'elle fait référence aux déclarations faites par le demandeur au point d'entrée, la Commission devrait être attentive également au fait que [traduction] « la plupart des réfugiés ont vécu dans leur pays d'origine des expériences qui leur donnent de bonnes raisons de ne pas faire confiance aux personnes en autorité » : voir le professeur James C. Hathaway,
The Law of Refugee Status
, Toronto, Butterworth, 1991, aux p. 84 et 85; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée;
Takhar
, précitée.
[. . . . .]
Il n'y a pas de doute que le défaut de mentionner, dans une déclaration écrite aux autorités de l'Immigration, des événements importants sur lesquels une revendication du statut de réfugié est fondée, ou une contradiction entre cette déclaration et un témoignage subséquent sont des facteurs très graves qui peuvent justifier une conclusion défavorable concernant la crédibilité. L'omission ou la contradiction doit cependant être bien réelle : voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) (C.A.). De plus, les explications données par un demandeur qui ne sont pas manifestement invraisemblables doivent être prises en compte : voir
Owusu-Ansah
, précitée.
[15]
À mon avis, la conclusion générale de non-crédibilité de la Commission n’est pas manifestement déraisonnable. Ici, la Commission a pris en compte les explications du demandeur principal et les a rejetées en fournissant des motifs qui ne m’apparaissent pas capricieux ou arbitraires. La contradiction entre les notes au point d’entrée et le témoignage du demandeur principal est bien réelle et ce n’est pas la seule qui a été relevée par la Commission dans sa décision. Il n’y a aucune raison de douter ici de la véracité et de l’exactitude des déclarations ayant été faites par le demandeur principal à l’agent d’immigration. D’autre part, je note que le demandeur principal est un homme instruit et qu’il est lui-même avocat. On pouvait donc s’attendre à ce qu’il puisse expliquer à l’agent d’immigration et à la Commission avec une certaine clarté les raisons l’ayant amené à quitter son pays. Enfin, il ne s’agit pas d’un cas où la preuve au dossier démontre qu’un préjudice réel a été causé à un demandeur d’asile à cause d’erreurs flagrantes de traduction commises par un interprète à l’audition ou lors de l’entrevue initiale avec l’agent d’immigration.
[16]
En conclusion, je n’ai pas à me substituer ici à la Commission dans l’évaluation de la preuve. Par ailleurs, il n’est pas nécessaire que je me prononce sur la légalité de la conclusion de la Commission touchant la protection de l’État étant donné que le récit des demandeurs a été jugé non crédible et que cet aspect de la décision de la Commission n’est pas révisable. Aucune question d’importance générale n’a été soulevée et ne se soulève en l’espèce.

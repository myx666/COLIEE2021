 Summary: 
 
 The applicants, refugee protection claimants, appeared before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) without their solicitor of record. They requested an adjournment on the basis that they wished to retain the services of different counsel. The RPD rejected the request. At the end of the hearing, the RPD granted an extension to enable the applicants to retain counsel to make submissions and explain the documentary evidence. The applicants' new counsel moved for recusal and for a de novo hearing, which the RPD denied. The RPD determined that the applicants were neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The applicants applied for judicial review. The issue to be decided was whether the RPD breached procedural fairness by refusing to adjourn the hearing. 
 
 
 
 The Federal Court allowed the application and referred the matter to a differently constituted panel for redetermination.

 This application for judicial review was considered in Montreal, Quebec, by Shore, J., of the Federal Court, who delivered the following reasons for order and order, dated May 9, 2012. 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
                                                                                                      
 
 
 
 I.  
 Introduction 
 
 
 
 [1] 
   
 Shore, J. 
  [Translation]: In  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, the Supreme Court of Canada set out the following principle, which is relevant to this case: 
 
 
 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
 
 
 II.  
 Judicial procedure 
 
 
 
 [2] 
  This is an application for judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA), of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), dated September 7, 2011, in which it was determined that the Applicants were neither Convention refugees as defined in section 96 of the IRPA nor persons in need of protection under section 97 of the IRPA. 
 
 
 
 III.  
 Facts 
 
 
 
 [3] 
  The applicants, Betuel Hernandez Aguilar, his wife, Hayde Lobato Jorge, and their children, Adriadna Brigit Hernandez Lobato and Brandon Bethuel Hernandez Lobato , are citizens of Mexico. 
 
 
 
 [4] 
  On May 31, 2011, the applicants appeared before the RPD without their solicitor of record. The applicants requested an adjournment at the beginning of the hearing on the basis that they wished to retain the services of different counsel. The RPD rejected the postponement request. 
 
 
 
 [5] 
  Faced with the principal applicant's refusal to proceed, the RPD informed him that it could declare the claim abandoned pursuant to subsection 168(1) of the IRPA. It seems that the principal applicant told the RPD that he was prepared to proceed, and the hearing continued. 
 
 
 
 [6] 
  At the end of the hearing, the RPD apparently granted the principal applicant leave to file certain untranslated documents the following day. It also granted an extension until June 17, 2011, to enable him to retain the services of counsel able to make submissions and explain the documentary evidence filed. 
 
 
 
 [7] 
  On June 11, 2011, their new counsel filed a motion for recusal and for a  
 de novo 
  hearing, which the RPD denied on June 27, 2011. The RPD set a new deadline of July 29, 2011, for filing submissions. The submissions were filed on July 29, 2011, and were accompanied by a package of evidence that was later rejected by the RPD. 
 
 
 
 IV.  
 Decision that is the subject of this application for judicial review 
 
 
 
 [8] 
  The RPD's denial of the applicants' request to adjourn is based on subsection 48(4) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules 
 , SOR/2002-228 [Rules]. 
 
 
 
 [9] 
  In dealing with this preliminary issue, the RPD held that the principal applicant had provided contradictory information. It found that the principal applicant had not acted reasonably in telling his former consultant just one week before the hearing that he would no longer be retaining his services. The RPD essentially criticized the principal applicant for not having made an effort to retain the services of new counsel to assist him during his hearing. The RPD based its decision on the fact that the case was not complicated and that the principal applicant's former counsel was not in possession of any of the documents. 
 
 
 
 [10] 
  After reviewing the facts and dealing with the preliminary issues, the RPD concluded that the applicants were not credible on the basis of their late filing of documents that should have been filed on June 1, 2011. 
 
 
 
 V.  
 Issue 
 
 
 
 [11] 
  As nobody has challenged the RPD's findings with respect to credibility, the sole issue to be decided is the following: 
 
 
 
 Did the RPD breach procedural fairness by refusing to adjourn the hearing? 
 
 
 
 VI.  
 Relevant statutory provisions 
 
 
 
 [12] 
  The following provisions of the Rules are applicable in this case: 
 
 
 
 Application to change the date or time of a proceeding

 (5) Unless a party receives a decision from the Division allowing the application, the party must appear for the proceeding at the date and time fixed and be ready to start or continue the proceeding. 
 
 
 
 Abandonment without hearing the claimant 
 
 
 
 58. (1) A claim may be declared abandoned, without giving the claimant an opportunity to explain why the claim should not be declared abandoned, if

 (b) the Minister and the claimant's counsel, if any, do not have the claimant's contact information. 
 
 
 
 Opportunity to explain 
 
 
 
 (2) In every other case, the Division must give the claimant an opportunity to explain why the claim should not be declared abandoned. The Division must give this opportunity

 (b) in any other case, by way of a special hearing after notifying the claimant in writing.

 Decision to start or continue the proceedings 
 
 
 
 (4) If the Division decides not to declare the claim abandoned, it must start or continue the proceedings without delay.

 Poursuite de l'affaire 
 
 
 
 (4) Si la Section décide de ne pas prononcer le désistement, elle commence ou poursuit l'affaire sans délai. 
 
 
 
 VII.  
 Positions of the parties 
 
 
 
 [13] 
  The applicants argue that the RPD committed a breach of procedural fairness by refusing to adjourn the hearing of May 31, 2011. 
 
 
 
 [14] 
  The respondent, on the other hand, argues that the right to counsel is not absolute and that the tribunal acted in accordance with the law and jurisprudence in refusing the applicants' request. 
 
 
 
 VIII.  
 Analysis 
 
 
 
 [15] 
  The standard of review to be applied is reasonableness, as established by  
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. 
 
 
 
 [16] 
  It is well established that the decision to adjourn is within the discretion of the RPD, which, in making its decision, must take into account all the relevant factors and particular circumstances of the case ( 
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED). 
 
 
 
 [17] 
  In this case, however, the RPD's statements urging the applicant to proceed in order to avoid the abandonment of his claim for refugee protection demonstrate a level of pressure to proceed that could represent a breach of the duty of fairness. The climate of the hearing was not conducive to receiving the testimony of a refugee protection claimant, as indicated by the following excerpt from the hearing transcript: 
 
 
 
 [translation] 
 
 
 
 BY THE PRESIDING MEMBER (to the applicant) 
 
 
 
 - Sir, all you need to do is answer. There is no need to be on the defensive. You are on the defensive right now. I can see it in your demeanour. I would like you to relax a little bit, please. 
 
 
 
 BY THE APPLICANT (to the presiding member) 
 
 
 
 - But it is difficult for me. I need the help of a lawyer. I don't feel comfortable continuing. 
 
 
 
 BY THE PRESIDING MEMBER (to the applicant) 
 
 
 
 - I do not understand sir.  
 Why do you need a lawyer? Right now, I'm asking you questions about your history. It is what you have experienced. Why do you say that you don't feel comfortable and that you need a lawyer? It isn't complicated. These are questions about your experiences. Why do you need a lawyer to answer these questions? 
 
 
 
 BY THE APPLICANT (to the presiding member) 
 
 
 
 - Because you are telling me that I am on the defensive. That is not the case. But telling me all that, it makes me nervous, and it is not easy for us. [Emphasis added.] 
 
 
 
 (Tribunal Record (TR) at page 359) 
 
 
 
 [18] 
  Furthermore, it is difficult to understand, on the one hand, the RPD's position on the complexity of the case, based on which it decided that the principal applicant could proceed without counsel, and, on the other hand, its position on the time that had passed since the date of the claim for refugee protection, which led it to conclude that a further delay would not be advisable.  
 As the following statements show, the RPD did not hesitate, at the end of the hearing, to recommend that the applicant consult with counsel, in contradiction with its initial decision to refuse to adjourn 
 : 
 
 
 
 [translation] 
 
 
 
 BY THE PRESIDING MEMBER (to the applicant) 
 
 
 
 - . . . 
 
 
 
 - So, sir, what we are going to do, generally, once I finish my questions, counsel may ask other questions if he wants to and may then - then makes submissions. You said earlier that you had contacted some lawyers, the consultant Hoyos-Tello, among others. I am going to give you an extension so that you can familiarize yourself with the documentation on Mexico, and should you wish to make submissions, comments in writing in your case, I will give you time for that. 
 
 
 
 -  
 So, perhaps you can contact one of the lawyers you have already spoken with or a consultant, ask him if he can give you a hand in looking at the documentation and making your submissions. So I am going to give you time to prepare written submissions. Okay? 
  [Emphasis added.] 
 
 
 
 (TR at page 373) 
 
 
 
 [19] 
  Consequently, the RPD, through its conduct at the hearing, committed a breach of procedural fairness. In light of this finding, the Court will not analyze the credibility issue. 
 
 
 
 IX.  
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
 [20] 
  For the above reasons, the applicants' application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is referred to a differently constituted panel for redetermination. 
 
 
 
 [21] 
  To avoid additional delays, the Court suggests that the hearing be scheduled on a peremptory basis. 
 
 
 
 ORDER 
 
 
 
 [22] 
   
 THE COURT ORDERS that 
  the applicant's application for judicial review be allowed and the matter be referred to a differently constituted panel for redetermination. No question is certified. 
 
 
 
 Application allowed.

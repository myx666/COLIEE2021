Jerome, A.C.J.
: This is one of fourteen applications under s. 44 of the Access to Information Act which came on for hearing before me on September 8, 1987 in Toronto, Ontario. The applicants all seek to prevent the disclosure of meat inspection audit team reports prepared by the Department of Agriculture. While the facts of each application vary somewhat, the principles involved are generally the same. I therefore indicated that the Piller Sausages decision [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] (Court No. T-1024-85) would apply, with necessary modifications, to this application.
[2]
On March 1, 1985, Ken Rubin, an Ottawa consumer researcher, filed a request under the Access to Information Act for copies of the 1982-83 meat inspection audit reports on Canadian slaughter/meat packing plants. The nature of those reports was described in detail in the Piller Sausages decision. On being advised of this request, several of the plants, including this applicant, filed objections to the disclosure of the reports. They were informed by the Department of Agriculture that the reports would be released, with the exception of information considered confidential under s. 20(1)(b). This application is for a review of that decision.
[3]
The intervenor raised some preliminary points at the hearing. He asked me to review the decision not to disclose the portions already exempted under s. 20(1)(b) and to declare the whole of the reports disclosable under s. 20(2). My reasons for rejecting those submissions are set out in the Gainers decision [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] (Court No. T-1131-85).
[4]
Like the other applicants in this case, Intercontinental Packers seeks to show that the reports the Department proposes to release are exempt from disclosure under s. 20(1) of the Act. A number of its submissions in support of that contention parallel those brought forward in the other applications. However, this applicant also raises a series of additional arguments which I will deal with separately.
[5]
The applicant claims that s. 20(1) reflects Parliament's intention that the Access to Information Act not be used as a device to injure innocent third parties. In this connection, they allege that the motivation of the requestors in this case should be examined. The requests themselves show knowledge of the content of the documents and suggest a motive other than obtaining an accurate portrayal of plant conditions.
[6]
I cannot accept this submission. The purpose of the Access to Information Act is to provide a right of access to information under government control. That right is available to every member of the public and cannot be restricted by considerations of motive or occupation. The only way motivation could be relevant is in order to establish a reasonable expectation of harm to third parties under ss. 20(1)(c) or (d). The mere fact that this requestor is a consumer researcher does not lead me to such an expectation. For the reasons set out in the Piller Sausages decision, I do not think that this information, if released into the hands of the requestor, will in any way materially harm the applicant, even if the purpose is to publicize their content for the information of the general public. The negative comments contained in these reports are simply too minor and too well balanced by positive information to threaten any kind of genuine injury to the applicant.
[7]
Turning to the specifics of the applicant's claim, it seeks to rely on all four paragraphs of s. 20(1) in its attempt to establish an exemption. For convenience, I will set out the subsection here:
"20(1) Subject to this section, the head of a government institution shall refuse to disclose any record requested under this Act that contains
(a) trade secrets of a third party;
(b) financial, commercial, scientific or technical information that is confidential information supplied to a government institution by a third party and is treated consistently in a confidential manner by the third party;
(c) information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to result in material financial loss or gain to, or could reasonably be expected to prejudice the competitive position of, a third party; or
(d) information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with contractual or other negotiations of a third party."
[8]
Beginning with paragraph (a), the applicant alleges that it has confidential processes by which it ensures compliance with the standards enforced during these inspections and that these amount to trade secrets. In the past, reports such as these have made reference to and disclosed these processes. However, the only example of such a "trade secret" to which the applicant could point in these reports is a comment referring to the need for "better cleanup" of "equipment". (
Cross-examination of Russell Baker
, questions 39-41). I agree with the respondent that this phrase does not disclose a trade secret and that a general allegation that such secrets have been in these reports in the past is not enough to establish an exemption under this head.
[9]
The applicant also relies on s. 20(1)(b). It will be remembered that certain portions of these reports have already been exempted on this ground. This applicant maintains that the remainder of the reports also constitutes financial, commercial, scientific or technical information which is confidential, supplied by a third party and has been treated consistently in a confidential manner by the third party.
[10]
Without making a specific ruling to that effect, I am prepared to assume that this is financial, commercial or technical information that has been supplied by the applicant and which it has kept confidential. The more significant determination, however, is whether this information can in itself be considered "confidential".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , I stated that s. 20(1)(b) requires not only that the third party must have treated the requested information as confidential, but that it be confidential in nature, by some objective standard. These reports fail that test for two reasons. First, as pointed out in the Piller Sausages decision, the reports are produced by public authorities, spending public funds, in order to protect the public. They must therefore be presumed to contain public information. It would be a basic contradiction in terms if this information was also held to be private and confidential. Indeed, the only way an applicant could establish such a proposition would be to show that, despite its public character, the material in the reports has been consistently kept confidential by all the parties involved and is not available from sources to which the public has access. That cannot be done. The information in the audit reports has been available since 1972 in the companion American reports which can be obtained on request from the Department of Agriculture in Washington. In addition, the Canadian reports were released between 1981 and 1983. I do not find, therefore, that these reports contain information which is, by objective standards, confidential. An exemption under s. 20(1)(b) has not been established.
[11]
This applicant's submissions under ss. 20(1)(c) and (d) basically parallel those of the other applicants in these cases. They are based in part on the affidavit of an additional expert, Andrew Schmitz, but I do not find that his evidence differs importantly from that of Professor Thompson or Mr. Adams. In addition, the applicant lists a large number of negative effects which have resulted from the release of negative information in the meat and fish packing industries. However, none of these effects was shown to have resulted from the release of reports similar to the ones at issue here and none was ever quantified in terms of producing an identifiable loss or injury to companies in the applicant's position. Again, no loss was shown to have resulted from the release of the information in these reports by the U.S. Department of Agriculture or by Agriculture Canada between 1981 and 1983.
[12]
Dealing with the export market, this is the only applicant to allege that information similar to these reports has actually been used in the past to maintain nontariff barriers to imports. Cross-examination, however, establishes that the applicant's concerns are with barriers erected by the EEC based on European audits of North American plants. The applicant's representative could cite no examples of information from Canadian or American Agriculture authorities being used in this way (
Cross-examination of Russell Barker
, pp. 25-27, questions 66-71). I must conclude that release of these reports, if brought to the attention of foreign importers at all, will not materially change their attitude towards Canadian meat products. My reasons for so finding are elaborated on in the Piller Sausages decision.
[13]
In sum, this applicant has not succeeded in establishing a case for an exemption under s. 20(1)(c) on the basis of material harm to either domestic or international markets for its products.
[14]
The arguments under s. 20(1)(d) did not differ markedly from those of other applicants and need not be addressed separately. There were, however, some very interesting submissions raised on the subject of the burden of proof in s. 44 applications. The applicant maintains that unlike a government institution which resists disclosure, a third party applicant under s. 44 does not bear the entire burden of proof. The provision which places this onus on the government institution is s. 48, which specifically applies only to applications under ss. 41 and 42 (applications by a requestor or the Information Commissioner to force a reluctant government institution to disclose). There is no similar provision with respect to s. 44. Therefore, it is argued, Parliament did not intend that third parties, who might be harmed by the release of information, bear the whole burden of showing it should not be disclosed. In fact, the applicant goes so far as to say that s. 20(1) places a protective shield around third party information and that the burden should be with those who seek to pierce it.
[15]
I must reject this argument for three reasons. First, the basic purpose of the Access to Information Act, as mentioned above, is to provide access to records under government control. Therefore, in an application under that Act, the party seeking to establish the opposite of that purpose should bear the burden of proof.
[16]
Second, and closely related, the whole structure of the statute requires that, before a document may be excepted from the disclosure requirement, it must come within one of the specific exemptions provided. This implies that it is up to the party seeking to restrict disclosure to establish that one of the exemptions applies, in this case, that the audit reports fall within s. 20(1). It is the applicants who allege this and it is their task to prove it.
[17]
Third, to adopt the applicant's interpretation of the statute would result in an absurdity. It would require the head of the government institution who seeks to disclose to establish a negative. He or she would have to show, under the terms of s. 20(1) that this information was
not
a trade secret, was
not
confidential or treated confidentially by the applicant and would
not
result in financial or competitive harm or contractual interference to the applicant or any other third party. Merely to state such a proposition is to demonstrate its impossibility. The only intelligent interpretation of the statute is that the applicant must at least make a case for the exemption under s. 20(1) before the respondent's onus to disprove it arises.
[18]
The applicant has not discharged that onus in this case. For the reasons given above and in the Piller Sausages decision, I am not persuaded that the reports in issue here are exempt from disclosure under s. 20(1). They may be disclosed in the form proposed by the Department of Agriculture. The application to resist disclosure is therefore dismissed with costs.
Application dismissed.

 This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Mainville, J. 
 : In this case, an application was submitted by Workinesh Bulla Mandida (the "Applicant"), seeking judicial review of a decision dated December 12, 2008 by an Immigration Officer (the "Officer") who carried out a pre-removal risk assessment; he concluded that the Applicant would not be subjected to a risk of persecution, danger of torture, risk to life or risk of cruel or unusual punishment if she returned to Ethiopia.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  For the reasons set out below, this application for judicial review is dismissed, mainly on the ground that the Applicant did not submit any evidence to the Officer supporting any finding of risk should she be returned to Ethiopia. The Applicant has, rather unwisely, chosen to treat her pre-removal risk assessment application as a form of request for relief on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Background  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The Applicant is an elderly national from Ethiopia who is now over 70 years old and who has had a long and convoluted history of claims with the Canadian immigration authorities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  The Applicant originally arrived in Canada with her elderly husband on September 20, 2000, as a visitor. It is useful to note that the Applicant's son and daughter were residing in Canada at that time. A few months later, on May 29, 2001, the Applicant and her husband claimed refugee status.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  On March 1, 2002, the Convention Refugee Determination Division ("CRDD") ruled that the Applicant and her husband were not Convention refugees. The CRDD came to this determination mainly on the ground that the Applicant's husband, who was the principal applicant in their joint refugee claim, was simply not credible and that his entire story was implausible. The CRDD also noted that the Applicant had herself returned to Ethiopia in March 1992; that was viewed by the CRDD as incompatible with her claim of persecution in that country. The CRDD also took into account the fact that the Applicant and her husband had waited over 7 months after their arrival in Canada to apply for refugee status.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  That decision of the CRDD was not challenged by way of judicial review and is therefore final.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Following the rejection of this refugee claim, the Applicant's husband returned to Ethiopia, but the Applicant has remained in Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The notes provided by the Respondent show that, in June 2002, the Applicant submitted an application for permanent residence based on her son's sponsorship, with a request that this application be processed from within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. However that request was denied in 2005.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  On March 13, 2005, the Applicant's son-in-law died. Some time thereafter, the Applicant moved in with her widowed daughter in Oakville, Ontario, to assist her with her three children. The Applicant's daughter filed a new family class sponsorship for the Applicant; and the Applicant herself filed a new concurrent permanent residence application which is currently being processed as an overseas application under the family class by the Canadian immigration authorities in Nairobi, and a decision on this matter is still pending.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  The Applicant has nevertheless remained in Canada on the basis of a temporary work permit issued to her as a live-in caregiver for her daughter. The Applicant's current work permit expires on December 21, 2010.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  For unknown reasons, on May 12, 2008, the Applicant filed an application for a pre-removal risk assessment. As already noted, that assessment resulted in findings unfavourable to the Applicant on December 12, 2008. Following this decision, the Applicant's removal from Canada was scheduled for February 6, 2009. That removal was subsequently stayed by Justice O'Keefe on February 4, 2009 pending the results of this judicial review proceeding.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  In her pre-removal risk assessment application, the Applicant raised the following as significant incidents that caused her to seek protection outside of her country of nationality:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 1. My daughter, Hirut Dano of Oakville, ON submitted family class sponsorship on my behalf and met the requirement for eligibility.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 2. I also submitted permanent residence applications which is currently pending decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 3. Meanwhile, my daughter offered me employment as a foreign worker which was approved by respective Canadian government and authorities  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 4. I also applied for work permit and have obtained social insurance number (SIN)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 5. Now, I believe my status has changed and I am in Canada under a work permit  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 6. I have submitted medical report and police certificate to the Canadian High Commission in Nairobi  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (sic throughout)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The Applicant also explained as follows why she did not seek any form of protection from the authorities in Ethiopia:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The authorities of my country are not in a position to grant me protection. The authorities of my country of origin are engaged in violation of human rights. To seek protection from such authorities is tantamount to exposing myself to danger and risk.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 However, the Applicant did not explain what specific "danger and risk" she was referring to.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  In a letter accompanying the pre-removal risk assessment application, the Applicant's legal counsel essentially reiterated and expanded upon these humanitarian and compassionate considerations, but raised no specific issue related to any risk the Applicant would face if returned to Ethiopia.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The impugned decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  The Officer notes that the facts raised by the Applicant in support of her pre-removal risk assessment are rather arguments based, for the most part, on humanitarian and compassionate considerations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  After noting that the Applicant's refugee claim had been rejected by the CRDD under the provisions of the immigration legislation as it stood prior to the coming into force of the current  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the "Act"), the Officer recognized the expanded ambit of the pre-removal risk assessment that was to be carried out in the Applicant's case:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 In considering this PRAA (sic) application, I was required under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) to accept all evidence tendered to establish a ground for protection under section 97 because at the time of the applicant's claim for refugee status was decided, section 97 did not exist. I was also required to accept new evidence on convention ground under section 96 that arose after the rejection as per section (sic) 113(a) of the same Act. The burden of proof is on the applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  The Officer then went on to state that the Applicant and her counsel had simply put forward arguments for the Applicant to remain in Canada without any reference to risk factors. The Officer thus concluded that these arguments did not fall under the purview of a pre-removal risk application, but rather pertained to a humanitarian and companionate needs application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  The Officer further noted that the Applicant had failed to offer any evidence corroborating that she would be personally at risk if she returned to Ethiopia.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  The Officer thus concluded, on the basis of the record, that there was no more than a mere possibility that the Applicant will be subjected to persecution if she returned to Ethiopia, and that there were no substantial grounds to believe she will face a risk of torture, or a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Position of the Applicant  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  The Applicant's written submissions commence with a challenge of the 2002 decision of the CRDD, even though she is long time-barred from challenging this decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  The Applicant then adds that, since the 2002 CRDD decision, she is now at risk in that "she will be subjected to gender discrimination and ridicule by her community in Ethiopia for her separation from her husband for eight years" (para. 18 of Applicant's written submissions), and "has nowhere to go as her relationship with her relatives has been severed" (para. 19 of the Applicant's written submissions). These issues were, however, never raised before the Officer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
  The Applicant also raises a whole series of other humanitarian and compassionate issues, some of which were not brought to the attention of the Officer, such as the "best interest of the applicant's Canadian-born grandchildren" (para. 23 of the Applicant's written submissions), "fatal consequences as a result of long hours of flight between Canada and Ethiopia" (para. 24 of the Applicant's written submissions), "being torn apart from her grandchildren" (para. 25 of the Applicant's written submissions), etc.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [23] 
  In his oral submissions, the Applicant's counsel referred to a number of cases, almost all of which concerned applications for consideration on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Position of the Respondent  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  The Respondent notes that the submissions made in support of the pre-removal risk assessment amount to a recitation of humanitarian and compassionate factors which are beyond the purview of a pre-removal risk assessment. Since the Applicant did not identify in her pre-removal risk assessment application any risk she would be exposed to were she to return to Ethiopia, the Respondent submits that this application for judicial review should be dismissed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  The Respondent further notes that the Applicant now raises new risk factors which were never brought to the attention to the Officer. Therefore, they can have no bearing on this judicial review application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  In a nutshell, the Respondent argues that the Applicant has confused a pre-removal risk assessment application with an application based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Analysis  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  The pre-removal risk assessment procedure is the logical consequence of Canada's domestic and international commitments to the principle of non-refoulement. Under that principle, a person should not be removed to a country where he or she would be at risk of persecution, torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Canada's commitment to the principle of non-refoulement requires that there be a review of risk prior to removal.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  Under Canada's current immigration and refugee protection legislation, risk may be assessed by way of a determination by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board pursuant to sections 96 or 97 of the Act or by way of a pre-removal risk assessment pursuant to section 112 thereof. There is a close connection between these various legislative provisions. As noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R (4th) 675, [2007] F.C.J. No. 1632 (QL) at para. 11:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Assuming there are no issues of criminality or national security, an application under subsection 112(1) is allowed if, at the time of the application, the applicant meets the definition of "Convention refugee" in section 96 of the IRPA or the definition of "person in need of protection" in section 97 of the IRPA (paragraph 113(c) of the IRPA). The result of a successful PRRA application is to confer refugee protection on the applicant (subsection 114(1) of the IRPA).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [30] 
  In a pre-removal risk assessment, it is the applicant who bears the burden of proof. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Thus, the Applicant in this case had the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be at risk of persecution, torture, to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she returned to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 126, [2007] F.C.J. No. 111 (QL) at para. 3;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] F.C.J. No. 1308 (QL) at paras. 20-21;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] F.C.J. No. 1417 (QL) at para. 6.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [31] 
  In this case, the Applicant has led no evidence whatsoever concerning the risk she would be exposed to if she returned to Ethiopia, limiting her representations before the Officer to issues related to humanitarian and compassionate considerations should she be removed from Canada.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [32] 
  The case law is clear: humanitarian or compassionate considerations need not to be considered in a pre-removal risk assessment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 540 (QL) at para. 70, Justice Mosley noted the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 By the same logic, I find that PRRA officers need not consider humanitarian and compassionate factors in making their decisions. There is no discretion afforded to a PRRA officer in making a risk assessment. Either the officer is satisfied that the risk factors alleged exist and are sufficiently serious to grant protection, or the officer is not satisfied. The PRRA inquiry and decision-making process does not take into account factors other than risk. In any case, there is a better forum for the consideration of humanitarian and compassionate factors: the H&C determination mechanism. I do not find that the officer erred in law by refusing to consider humanitarian and compassionate factors in the context of the PRRA decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 See also  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 11, [2005] F.C.J. No. 638 (QL) at para. 15;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 24, [2005] F.C.J. No. 1470 (QL) at paras. 34 to 38;  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 277 D.L.R. (4th) 762, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1828 (QL), at paras. 6 and 12, expressly indicated that an application for a pre-removal risk assessment under section 112 of the Act should not be confused with an application for consideration of humanitarian and compassionate factors under section 25 of the Act, and then added that the best interest of a child need not be considered in the context of a pre-removal risk assessment:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 PRRA officers' mandate is carefully defined by IRPA and should not be judicially expanded to include the interests of any Canadian-born children who may be adversely affected by a parent's removal. It is not necessary to read words into the relevant provisions of IRPA in order for it to comply with the Canadian Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, and Canada's obligations in international law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [...]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Although the same officer may sometimes make a PRRA and determine an H&C application, the two decision-making processes should be neither confused, nor duplicated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2005 FC 583 at para. 16.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [34] 
  Consequently, I find that no reviewable error has been made by the Officer in refusing to consider the evidence based on humanitarian and compassionate factors offered by the Applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [35] 
  The fundamental problem in this case is that the Applicant has confused a pre-removal risk assessment under section 112 of the Act and a request for exemption on humanitarian and compassionate grounds under section 25 of the Act. This confusion has resulted in the Applicant submitting an odd pre-removal risk assessment application. The Officer in this case carried out a risk assessment on the basis of the information which the Applicant provided. Any alleged failure to assess risk is of the Applicant's own making.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [36] 
  At the hearing, counsel for both parties indicated that they had no question to certify pursuant to paragraph 74(d) of the Act, and no such question is raised by these proceedings.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 Summary: 
 
 Oduro claimed Convention refugee status on the ground of a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to his native Ghana. The Board dismissed his claim, on the grounds that he was not credible and, even if he were, changed conditions in Ghana rendered any fear of persecution no longer well-founded. Oduro applied for judicial review of the decision.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Divi­sion, allowed the application, set aside the decision and remitted the matter for rehear­ing before a differently constituted panel of the Board.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 This application was heard at Toronto, Ontario, on December 8, 1993, before Mc­Keown, J., of the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, who delivered the following decision on December 24, 1993.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
                                                                                                       <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [1] McKeown, J. 
 : The issue is: did the appellant have a well-founded fear of perse­cution for a Convention reason. The panel found the applicant "is neither trustworthy nor credible and even if the panel had found him credible, the panel would have to con­sider the changes in Ghana".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The applicant submitted that the reason he was persecuted by the government was because he was opposing the government's efforts to legitimize themselves. People continued to have problems after the change in circumstances. One person died in cus­tody. The legitimacy of this fear was never tested by the Board because of its findings on his credibility.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The Board had the following to say with regards to the changing circumstances in Ghana:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "A number of changes took place in Ghana since the claimant left Ghana. A referen­dum on a Constitution was held on April 28, 1992. The majority of the voters approved the constitution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The PNDC government of Ghana granted an amnesty to political prisoners, released confiscated assets, and the new constitution adopted in Ghana ended the ban on party politics. The fact that he was a secretary in a local organization of a small town in Ghana, and after the panel had decided to give no weight to the CDR letter dated November 13, 1990, and on the light of the recent democratic changes, the claim­ant - on the balance of probabilities - would not face persecution for any of the grounds set out in the definition. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [4] 
  The board held its hearing on August 5, 1992, only three months after the date of the referendum.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  As stated by Wetston, J., in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at pp. 129-130 where he quotes from Marceau, J.A., in  
 Rahman and  
 Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , May 14, 1993 (unreported) A-1244-91 (F.C.A.)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The central issue to be determined by the Board is whether the change is sufficient in terms of its effect on the social and political climate of the country of origin, given the basis of the fear on which the claimant relies:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 'Whether a change of circumstances is sufficient for a fear of persecution to be no longer well-founded must naturally be determined in relation to the basis of and reasons for the fear relied on.' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [6] 
  Wetston, J., in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  country conditions as expressed in the recent Federal Court of Appeal decisions succinctly. He concluded on facts similar to this matter that a recent change in the con­stitution when there was no change in a government which had a lamentable human rights record was insufficient to conclude that there is "a clear indication of the mean­ingful and effective change which is required" to negate the objective basis to the applicant's claims.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  Recent decisions of the Court of Appeal require a sufficient analysis in the decision of the conflicting evidence to determine if there has been a meaningful and effective change. Marceau, J.A., in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at pp. 223-224 stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "While counsel for the appellant disputes the validity of these two reasons advanced by the tribunal in support of its conclusion, counsel for the respondent replies very simply that they constitute findings of facts for which support can be found in the evidence and with which, therefore, this court should not interfere. We know that the position taken by counsel for the re­spondent is traditional in appeals against decisions supported by similar findings, but still we do not believe that it is wholly satisfactory.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "... Similarly, the mere fact that there has been a change of government is clearly not in itself sufficient to meet the requirements of a change of circumstances which have rendered the genuine fear of a claimant unreasonable and hence without founda­tion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "... the mere declarations of the new four-month old government that it favoured the establishment of law and order can hardly be seen, when the root the appellant's fear and the past record of the new government with respect to human rights violations are considered, as a clear indication of the meaningful and effective change which is required to expunge the objective founda­tion of the appellant's claim. But, in any event, even if the conclusions of the tribu­nal were correct, we do not accept that they can be advanced without more expla­nation to establish that the appropriate legal principles were applied. The appli­cant's claim was not properly dealt with and the decision cannot be allowed to stand. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [8] 
  In my view the Federal Court of Appeal has determined that the determination of change in circumstances is a mixed question of fact and law. Accordingly, the Board needs to provide a sufficient explanation of the facts in order that the reviewing court may determine if the appropriate legal prin­ciples were applied. The Minister submitted that even if it was necessary to review the conflicting evidence in this matter the Board had done so at p. 3 of the Reasons:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The claimant testified that he heard about the planned presidential and parliamentary elections as well as the release of coup-plotters and many others. He further tes­tified that he heard about lifting the ban on the political parties. Asked if those changes made him feel comfortable to return, he replied that those changes would not help his case in any way and made reference to the letter of the CDR. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [9] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Marceau, J.A., expanded his views further when he stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Again, a more detailed analysis of the conflicting evidence in respect of a change in circumstances was necessary to meet the requirement that the change be meaningful and effective enough to render the genuine fear of the appellant unreasonable and hence without foundation. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [10] 
  The Board must determine if there is such meaningful and effective change and then determine how it relates to the appli­cant's fear of persecution. In my view there was no meaningful and effective change in the conditions in Ghana when the constitu­tional change was made just over three months prior to the hearing of the Board. The same government with its lamentable human rights record remained in power. The case is virtually indistinguishable in this respect from  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  effective change in circumstances in Ghana, I do not have to determine if any changes which have occurred relate to the applicant's fear of persecution.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  Although the Board reviewed credibility its conclusions are primarily based on the change in country conditions. The Board found at p. 6 that:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "As a result of the magnitude of this democratization process, the panel finds that the claimant's fear of persecution for any of the grounds enumerated in the  
 Immi­gration Act 
  to be, less than a mere possi­bility.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The onus is on the claimant, to establish through evidence that he has a well-founded of persecution for any one of the grounds in the definition of Convention refugee in the  
 Immigration Act 
 , if he were to return to Ghana. The claimant failed to establish this.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The Refugee Division, after considering the entire evidence, both written and oral, and for the above reasons, is not persuaded that there are any good grounds for the claimant to fear persecution for any of the grounds in the  
 Immigration Act 
 , should he return to Ghana.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Therefore, the Refugee Division deter­mines, Ebenezer Oduro is not a Conven­tion refugee. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [12] 
  Since I have determined on the law and evidence before me there were no meaning­ful and effective changes, the Board's con­clusions, except for the second conclusion, are contrary to the law and evidence on changing country conditions. The second conclusion is not viable since the Board's central finding on credibility must be recon­sidered.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  The applicant raised the issue that the credibility findings by the Board were not supported by the record. The applicant sub­mitted that the word "bankers" on a letter from the CDR, a committee which assisted the government in maintaining its dictatorial power, could not be evidence that the letter was not credibile since there was no evi­dence as to the effect of this word in this type of letter in Ghana. In the letter dated October 4, 1990, the CDR asked him to appear before their Investigation Committee. When he failed to appear the applicant was notified that this act was contrary to the spirit of the revolution and in violation of PNDL Law 78, 1984 and the date set for his trial was November 29, 1990. The applicant was also given the opportunity to respond to the Committee prior to that date. One of the Board members questioned the applicant as to why the word "Bankers" appeared as it did on the letter and the applicant stated he did not know. The Chairman subsequently intervened and the question was not pursued further. The Board appears to have specu­lated on what constitutes proper practices in letters of this kind in Ghana. This error is central to its findings on credibility since the Board determined that the applicant had not received a proper summons. The Board went on to say that if the letter were credible, the Board refused to accept it as reliable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  The applicant submits that it was wrong to say his testimony was unreliable because it was more detailed than the PIF. In my view the Board determined that the applicant omitted to disclose in his PIF material por­tions of events related to the determination of whether the applicant was persecuted. It was open to the Board to determine that these additions were added in his testimony to enhance the fear of persecution. It is no answer to say that the Board told him it was only interested in greater detail and not to repeat the contents of the PIF.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  Since the finding with respect to the non-receipt of the summons was central to the Board's findings, this matter must be reconsidered by a differently constituted Board. In light of its findings on credibility, I cannot agree that it was open to the Board to say that if the evidence related to the summons was credible, then it was not reliable. The Board could not properly weigh this evidence because of its specula­tion with respect to the effect of the word "Bankers".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [16] 
  The application is granted. The decision of the Board dated February 16, 1993 is set aside and the matter is returned for a rehear­ing of the applicant's claim by a differently constituted panel in a manner not incon­sistent with the reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  In view of my findings on change of country conditions I need not deal with the question as to whether I should follow the reasons of my learned colleague Rouleau, J., in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). I also do not need to deal with the portions of a memorandum relating to the credibility of applicants from Ghana written by an admin­istrative officer of the Board since there was no evidence before me that the memorandum was ever seen by the two members of the Board who heard this case. However, with­out deciding whether the latter memorandum is a sufficient breach of natural justice to require the matter to be returned to the Board, the Board should rescind the portion of the memorandum relating to credibility of claimants from Ghana and make it clear that it is up to the two members sitting on the case to determine the credibility of the claimants before them. There can be no consistency on findings of credibility. The Board is entitled to provide its members with training programs where the members can be instructed on matters to be considered or of assistance in the determination of the claimant's credibility.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Application allowed.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

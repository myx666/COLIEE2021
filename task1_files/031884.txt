Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2012] F.T.R. TBEd. NO.014.
[1]
Near, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of the decision of a Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) enforcement officer ("the Officer") dated February 3, 2012. In her decision, the Officer refused to defer the removal of the Applicants, Lucene Charles and her daughter, Ajohke Ahadzie, from Canada pursuant to section 48(2) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA).
[2]
For the following reasons, this application is dismissed.
I.
Background
[3]
The primary applicant ("the Applicant"), Lucene Charles, is a citizen of Saint Vincent. She first came to Canada in 1992 as a visitor. During her first stay in Canada, the Applicant married a Canadian citizen and had her first two children. She did not apply for permanent residence.
[4]
The Applicant and her family moved to The Gambia in 1999, where her third child was born. All three children are dual Canadian and Saint Vincentian citizens. In 2000, the Applicant and her husband separated. They obtained a formal divorce in 2006 from the High Court of The Gambia, and custody of all three children was granted to the Applicant by the Gambian courts. An injunctive order was also issued against the Applicant's ex-husband, restraining him from"molesting, harassing, assaulting, or threatening the petitioner in any manner whatsoever" (Application Record, Exhibit A at 12).
[5]
In 2007, the Applicant's fourth child, Ajohke Ahadzie, was born of her new relationship with a Gambian citizen. This child, a Gambian and Saint Vincentian citizen, is the secondary applicant in these proceedings.
[6]
In 2007, the Applicant returned to Canada with all four of her children. She and her daughter were granted visitor status for a period of six months upon entry. Subsequently, the Applicant has been unsuccessful in several applications for renewed or reinstated status in Canada:
• Work permit application: refused on January 22, 2008 on the grounds that she did not qualify to apply from inside Canada. Application for leave and judicial review was denied on May 15, 2008.
• First application for permanent residence on Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds (H&C application): refused on February 13, 2008. Application for leave was granted on August 22, 2008, but the final judicial review was denied (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 1718).
• Application for extension of visitor visa: refused on June 11, 2008.
• Application for Refugee Protection: refused on November 25, 2010.
• Second H&C application: refused on August 3, 2011.
• Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA): negative decision rendered on August 3, 2011.
[7]
The Applicant received Voluntary Departure Confirmation forms with the refusal of her initial work permit application, and was reported inadmissible to Canada under section 44(1) of IRPA first on February 14, 2008, and again on January 13, 2009. Conditional departure orders were issued for the Applicant and her daughter on January 13, 2009.
[8]
Following the refusal of the second H&C application and the PRRA, the CBSA directed the Applicant to begin making preparations for her removal from Canada. She was required to attend an interview at the Greater Toronto Enforcement Centre (GTEC) in November 2011, which did not take place until December 1, 2011. The Applicant submitted a written request for deferral on January 9, 2012, and a subsequent interview was held on January 12, 2012. The removal order was deferred by the CBSA until further notice on January 16, 2012 to allow the agency time to review the documents submitted by the Applicant.
[9]
At an interview with a CBSA officer on February 3, 2012, the Applicant informed the CBSA that she had recently submitted a new H&C application, as well as an application for a Temporary Resident Permit.
II.
Decision under Review
[10]
In her decision refusing the deferral, the Officer found that "counsel ha[d] submitted insufficient objective evidence to demonstrate that she and her daughter Ajohke face exceptionally difficult circumstances that justify a deferral of their removal to St. Vincent." The Officer noted that she had little discretion to defer removal and that, if an enforcement officer chooses to exercise such discretion, he or she must do so while continuing to enforce a removal order as soon as reasonably practicable.
[11]
The Officer acknowledged that the children were attending school and were involved in their communities, but noted that the Applicant was given "ample time to make a decision as to whether she would like all of her children to return with her to St. Vincent or if she would like to entrust them in someone's care in Canada." The Applicant had indicated in an interview with the CBSA that she would be transferring guardianship of her children to her priest, and she had extended family in Canada who could assist with the children. Had the Applicant decided to take all of her children with her to Saint Vincent, they would have all the benefits of Saint Vincentian citizenship and the opportunity to continue their education. The Officer further noted that the Applicant had previously travelled with the children to a country that was not the country of her citizenship, where they resided for several years.
[12]
The Officer further considered the personal circumstances of the Applicant. She noted that the Applicant had not applied for, or received, an extension to her visitor status the first time she arrived in Canada. In contrast, the Applicant received residency status in The Gambia. She found gainful employment both while in The Gambia and when she returned to Canada. The Officer inferred that the Applicant would be able to secure employment back in Saint Vincent, and noted that she has a support network of family in her home country, including parents and siblings. The Officer further stated that the Applicant was receiving child and spousal support from her ex-husband, and financial support from the father of her fourth child.
[13]
Furthermore, since returning to Canada, the Applicant submitted two applications for permanent residence that "thoroughly assessed [her] personal circumstances in Canada, including her establishment, ties to Canada, best interest of the children and the hardship she would face if she were returned to St. Vincent." The Officer noted that the CBSA had been sensitive to the Applicant's need to secure family law papers, and granted her extra time to secure the necessary orders.
[14]
The Officer concluded that the Applicant "has exhausted all of her avenues to remain in Canada legally", stating that:
A review of Ms. Charles' enforcement file as well as the evidence presented by counsel does not satisfy me that a deferral of Ms. Charles' removal from Canada, for any period of time, would compel her to make the appropriate arrangements for herself and her children to prepare for removal from Canada.
III.
Issues
[15]
This application raises the following issues:
(a) What was the proper record before the Officer?
(b) Given the record before her, was the Officer's decision reasonable?
IV.
Standard of Review
[16]
An enforcement officer's decision refusing to defer an applicant's removal from Canada is reviewable on a reasonableness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 314 at para 25). The Court will intervene only if the decision-making process is not justified, transparent and intelligible, or if the decision falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] SCR 190 at para 47).
V.
Analysis
A.
Record before the Officer
[17]
The Applicant submits that she requested a deferral of the enforcement of her removal order until:
(a) her children finished their school year;
(b) guardianship of her children was established;
(c) she was able to fundraise sufficient funds on which to survive when she arrived in Saint Vincent; or
(d) her most recent H&C application was processed.
[18]
She contends that her request for deferral on the basis of grounds (a) through (c) was made orally at her interview of December 1, 2011. The Applicant contends that her written submission of January 9, 2012, in which ground (d) was raised, was "over and above" the request made in the meeting on December 1, 2011. The Applicant further contends that she reiterated her request for deferral of the removal order during her subsequent interview on January 12, 2012, and that at no point was she informed that only written submissions would be considered. The Applicant thus takes the position that the Officer was under an obligation to consider each of her requests, and that the Officer failed to do so.
[19]
The Respondent, however, submits that no deferral request was made at the pre-removal interview on December 1, 2011, and that only the written deferral submissions presented by the Applicant were properly before the Officer for consideration. The Respondent does not contest that an oral request for deferral was made at the meeting on January 12, 2012. Rather, it submits that CBSA Officer Matadar, who conducted the interviews and who is not the Officer, denied the specific request for deferral made at the meeting of January 12, 2012, and that that particular oral decision is not under review in this application. In this way, I find that, contrary to the Applicant's assertions, there is no dispute as to the appropriate form of a deferral request. Both parties agree that such a request can properly be made either orally or in writing.
[20]
The Respondent further contends that the Officer was not obligated to consider, in her written decision of February 3, 2012, many of the grounds or personal circumstances that the Applicant now raises in her submissions because they were not included in the written deferral materials submitted on January 9, 2012. The Respondent further notes that the Applicant had not even submitted her third H&C application until after she submitted the written materials.
[21]
I am cognizant of the affidavit material filed by the Applicant with respect to the December 1, 2011 meeting with Officer Matadar. The first affidavit made by the Applicant in preparation for her stay motion was made more than two months after the meeting. The second affidavit, sworn by her friend, Robert Stevens, was made very recently - seven months after the events. The Respondent has correctly pointed out that the two affidavits are inconsistent as to what took place on December 1, 2011, which is not surprising given that they were prepared some time after the meeting. As such, I prefer the affidavit evidence of Officer Matadar.
[22]
Consequently, I am persuaded, on the basis of the substance of Officer Matadar's meeting notes from December 1, 2011, January 12, 2012, and February 3, 2012, that there was no request for deferral made orally at the meeting of December 1, 2011. A request for deferral of a removal order is a significant item to which an enforcement officer who is familiar with the removal process would be attuned. Indeed, the notes entered into the system following Officer Matadar's meetings with the Applicant on January 12, 2012 and February 3, 2012 indicate that he recognized on both occasions that a request for deferral was made orally. There is no evidence to suggest that there was any change in Officer Matadar's experience between the December 1, 2011 meeting and the meetings in the following two months that would point to his inability to recognize such a request in the first meeting.
[23]
Accordingly, I find that the record before the Officer, who was not present at any of the meetings, was limited to the written submissions offered by the Applicant on January 9, 2012 and the Applicant's file.
B.
Reasonableness of the Officer's Decision
(i)
The Officer's Discretion
[24]
The Federal Court of Appeal has emphasized that "an enforcement officer's discretion to defer removal is limited" (
Baron
, above at para 49). Section 48 of IRPA sets out a positive obligation for the enforcement of removal orders:
Enforceable removal order
48.
(1) A removal order is enforceable if it has come into force and is not stayed.
Effect
(2) If a removal order is enforceable, the foreign national against whom it was made must leave Canada immediately and it must be enforced as soon as is reasonably practicable.
Mesure de renvoi
48.
(1) La mesure de renvoi est exécutoire depuis sa prise d'effet dès lors qu'elle ne fait pas l'objet d'un sursis.
Conséquence
(2) L'étranger visé par la mesure de renvoi exécutoire doit immédiatement quitter le territoire du Canada, la mesure devant être appliquée dès que les circonstances le permettent.
[25]
A removal officer may consider various factors in determining whether it is "reasonably practicable" to execute a removal order, including illness, other impediments to travelling, pending H&C applications that were brought on a timely basis but have yet to be resolved due to backlogs in the system, children's school years, and pending births and deaths (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  7 Imm L R (3d) 141 at para 12;
Baron
, above at paras 49-51;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] FCJ No 295 at para 44).
[26]
While allowing for some discretion with respect to the timing of a removal, this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have declared that "deferral should be reserved for those applications where failure to defer will expose the applicant to the risk of death, extreme sanction or inhumane treatment" (
Wang
, above at para 48;
Baron
, above at para 51). The mere fact that an H&C application is pending, unless it is based on a threat to personal safety, is not sufficient to justify deferral of a valid removal order (
Baron
, above at para 51;
Wang
, above at para 45).
[27]
The Respondent contends that the Applicant requested an indefinite deferral order, which was outside the Officer's jurisdiction to grant. This Court has held that a deferral is a "temporary measure necessary to obviate a serious, practical impediment to immediate removal" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] FCJ No 182 at para 19;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 1035 at para 33), and that there is no authority in section 48(2) of IRPA for an indefinite deferral. However, I find that the Applicant did not request an indefinite deferral in her submissions of January 9, 2012, and that the Officer was required to consider the reason for the Applicant's request and the evidence submitted to support it (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 515 at para 18).
(ii) Individual Circumstances of the Applicant
[28]
The Applicant submits that the Officer erred in failing to consider her compelling individual circumstances. Specifically, she submits that the Officer did not account for the Applicant's particular history of abuse and its impact on her ability to prepare for removal. As the jurisprudence makes clear, the discretion of an enforcement officer in deferring the execution of a removal order is limited to narrow circumstances. Deferral is to be reserved for those cases where a failure to defer will expose the applicant to the risk of death, extreme sanction or inhumane treatment (
Baron
, above at para 51;
Wang
, above at para 48).
[29]
While the Applicant's history of abuse is tragic, it was not within the Officer's ambit of discretion to consider it in deciding whether to grant a deferral. Indeed, a request for deferral is not to be treated as a pre-H&C application, and the enforcement officer is not to assess the merits of the H&C application ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 19;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] FCJ No 805 at para 32; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 11). In my opinion, what the Applicant was asking the Officer to consider on this point were the merits of her H&C application, which, at the time of her request for deferral, she had not even submitted. The Officer's decision on this point was reasonable.
[30]
The Applicant additionally contends that the Officer erred in failing to consider the potential for her ex-husband to seek custody of the children upon her removal from Canada. While I recognize that this may have been an important factor for the Officer to weigh, there was no evidence supporting it in the record before the Officer. The Officer therefore could not err by failing to consider something that was not before her.
(iii)
Best Interests of the Children
[31]
The Applicant submits that the Officer further erred in failing to consider the short-term best interests of the children. Specifically, the Applicant contends that the Officer was obligated to consider: (i) the impact of the Applicant's departure on the children, given their disabilities and past trauma; (ii) the likelihood of her ex-husband to seek custody or to abduct the children in her absence; and (iii) the time and difficulty of finding a legal guardian for her Canadian children, in order to protect them from her ex-husband. I have already found that the Officer did not err in failing to consider the actions of the Applicant's ex-husband with respect to custody of the children because there was no evidence of this before the Officer.
[32]
This Court has found that the best interests of the child analysis applicable to enforcement officers in the context of removal orders is limited (
Baron
, above at para 57). Indeed, it is established law that "an enforcement officer has no obligation to substantially review the children's best interest before executing a removal order" (
Baron,
above at para 57), and that "illegal immigrants cannot avoid the execution of a valid removal order simply because they are the parents of Canadian-born children" (
Baron,
above at para 57).
[33]
The Applicant relies, inter alia, on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] FCJ No 1448, in which this Court held that an enforcement officer is within his mandate to evaluate whether provisions have been made for leaving a child in the care of others in Canada when the parent is to be removed (see para 40).
[34]
In this case, the Officer considered both whether there were provisions in place to care for the Applicant's three Canadian children should she decide to leave them in Canada, and what opportunities exist for them in Saint Vincent, should she decide to take them with her. It was reasonable for the Officer to conclude that the Applicant had sufficient time to make guardianship arrangements for her Canadian children. In the absence of evidence demonstrating how long and complicated the transfer of custody might be, the Officer was well within her rights to conclude that the Applicant had made arrangements for the care of her Canadian children when she indicated her desire to transfer custody. Indeed, as the Respondent points out, the Officer acknowledged in her reasons that the custody or guardianship arrangements were not finalized when she stated that the Applicant "expressed her desire to transfer guardianship of the boys." I note that the Applicant indicated her preference to leave her Canadian children behind months after she was first informed of her imminent removal from Canada. While I sympathize with the Applicant and recognize that this was a difficult decision to make, the Officer did not make a reviewable error on this point.
[35]
Furthermore, it was reasonable for the Officer to conclude that the Applicant has family in Canada that could be expected to support the children. While the Applicant now argues that this was an error of fact because her aunt has moved away from Canada, and the only family members remaining are those with whom she has little to no contact, this evidence was not squarely before the Officer when she made her decision. Once again, the Officer cannot be expected to make a decision on the basis of facts that are not before her.
[36]
Finally, I agree with the Respondent that the Applicant is asking for an analysis that is more appropriately suited to an H&C application in (I) above.
[37]
In sum, I find that the Officer's decision with respect to the best interests of the children was reasonable.
(iv)
Errors
[38]
The Applicant finally submits that the Officer misconstrued the Applicant's submissions and made unreasonable findings of fact. I have already addressed the Applicant's contentions with respect to her family support in Canada and the guardianship status of her children. The Applicant's final concern relates to the Officer's attendance to her financial situation and work history. Specifically, the Applicant argues that the Officer mistakenly assessed her ability to support herself based on her work history. I am unable to accept the Applicant's arguments. The Officer made a reasonable assessment of the Applicant's work experiences and skill level based on the evidence before her. For example, the Applicant's
curriculum vitae
describes her work experience and the duties performed in each of her jobs. The Applicant's own application for a work permit describes her as "highly skilled."
[39]
It was also reasonable for the Officer to conclude that the Applicant's mother would be a source of support for her in Saint Vincent, particularly in light of the fact that the letter from her mother, included as an affidavit in these proceedings, was not before the Officer.
[40]
Given the absence of evidence that the Applicant's ex-husband has not been meeting his support obligations since the Ontario court order of July 2011, it was equally reasonable for the Officer to conclude that this was a source of income for the Applicant. However, even if this was an error, the amount of support does not go to the heart of the Officer's decision, and thus does not constitute a reviewable error.
VI.
Conclusion
[41]
For the reasons above, I find that the Officer's decision was reasonable.
JUDGMENT
[42]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
this application for judicial review is dismissed.
.........................
Lucene  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Near
[Traduction]: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision d'une agente d'exécution (l'agente) de l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l'ASFC) en date du 3 février 2012. Dans sa décision, l'agente a refusé de reporter le renvoi du Canada des demanderesses, Lucene Charles et sa fille, Ajohke Ahadzie, en vertu du paragraphe 48(2) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la LIPR).
[2]
Pour les motifs suivants, la demande est rejetée.
I.
Contexte
[3]
La demanderesse principale (la demanderesse), Lucene Charles, est de citoyenneté saint-vincentaise. Elle est venue au Canada pour la première fois en 1992, en tant que visiteur. Lors de ce premier séjour au Canada, elle a épousé un citoyen canadien et a eu avec lui ses deux premiers enfants. Elle n'a pas sollicité la résidence permanente.
[4]
En 1999, la demanderesse et sa famille ont déménagé en Gambie, où est né son troisième enfant. Les trois enfants ont la double citoyenneté canadienne et saint-vincentaise. En 2000, la demanderesse et son mari se sont séparés. Ils ont obtenu, en 2006, de la Haute Cour de Gambie, un divorce, la garde des trois enfants ayant été accordée à la demanderesse par la justice gambienne. Une ordonnance d'injonction a par ailleurs été prononcée à l'encontre de l'ex-mari de la demanderesse, lui interdisant de [traduction] « importuner, harceler, agresser ou menacer de quelque manière que ce soit la requérante » (dossier de la demande, pièce A, page 12).
[5]
En 2007, le quatrième enfant de la demanderesse, Ajohke Ahadzie, est né d'une nouvelle relation, nouée avec un citoyen gambien. Cette enfant, de citoyenneté gambienne et saint-vincentaise, est, en l'espèce, la demanderesse secondaire.
[6]
En 2007, la demanderesse est revenue au Canada avec ses quatre enfants. À leur arrivée au Canada, sa fille et elle se sont vu accorder pour une période de six mois le statut de visiteur. La demanderesse s'est vu par la suite vu refuser plusieurs demandes de renouvellement ou de rétablissement de son statut au Canada:
• Demande de permis de travail: rejetée le 22 janvier 2008 au motif qu'elle ne pouvait pas présenter une telle demande depuis le Canada. Demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire rejetée le 15 mai 2008.
• Première demande de résidence permanente fondée sur des considérations humanitaires (demande CH): rejetée le 13 février 2008. Demande d'autorisation accordée le 22 août 2008, mais demanderesse déboutée à l'issue du contrôle judiciaire (voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 1718).
• Demande de prorogation du visa de visiteur: rejetée le 11 juin 2008.
• Demande d'asile: rejetée le 25 novembre 2010.
• Deuxième demande CH: rejetée le 3 août 2011.
• Examen des risques avant renvoi (ERAR): décision défavorable rendue le 3 août 2011.
[7]
Des formulaires de confirmation de départ volontaire ont été envoyés à la demanderesse avec le rejet de sa demande initiale de permis de travail et elle a été déclarée interdite de territoire, en vertu du paragraphe 44(1) de la LIPR, une première fois le 14 février 2008, puis de nouveau le 13 janvier 2009. Le 13 janvier 2009, des mesures d'interdiction de séjour conditionnelles ont été prises contre sa fille et elle.
[8]
Après le rejet de sa deuxième demande CH et la décision défavorable rendue à l'issue de l'ERAR, l'ASFC a fait savoir à la demanderesse qu'elle devait prendre ses dispositions en vue de son renvoi du Canada. On lui a demandé de se rendre en novembre 2011 à une entrevue au Centre d'exécution de la Loi du Grand Toronto (CELGT), l'entrevue n'ayant en fait lieu que le 1er décembre 2011. Le 9 janvier 2012, la demanderesse a présenté par écrit une demande de report du renvoi, et une autre entrevue a eu lieu le 12 janvier 2012. L'ASFC a, le 16 janvier 2012, reporté la mesure de renvoi jusqu'à nouvel ordre, se donnant ainsi le temps d'étudier les documents qui lui étaient présentés par la demanderesse.
[9]
Lors d'une entrevue avec un agent de l'ASFC le 3 février 2012, la demanderesse a fait savoir qu'elle avait récemment déposé une nouvelle demande CH, ainsi qu'une demande de permis de résidence temporaire.
II.
Décision en cause
[10]
Dans sa décision refusant le report, l'agente a conclu que [traduction] « le conseil de la demanderesse n'a pas produit d'éléments de preuve objectifs démontrant que la demanderesse et sa fille, Ajohke, se retrouveraient dans des circonstances exceptionnellement difficiles de nature à justifier le report de leur renvoi à Saint-Vincent ». L'agente a précisé que son pouvoir discrétionnaire de reporter le renvoi était limité, et que lorsqu'un agent d'exécution choisit d'exercer ce pouvoir, il doit le faire tout en appliquant la mesure de renvoi dès que les circonstances le permettent.
[11]
L'agente a reconnu que les enfants allaient à l'école et participaient à la vie sociale de leur communauté, relevant par contre que la demanderesse avait eu [traduction] « amplement le temps de décider si elle souhaitait que tous ses enfants rentrent avec elle à Saint-Vincent, ou si elle préférait les confier à quelqu'un au Canada ».Lors d'une entrevue avec l'ASFC, la demanderesse avait dit qu'elle entendait transférer à son prêtre la garde de ses enfants et qu'elle avait, au Canada, des proches qui pourraient aussi s'occuper d'eux. Si la demanderesse avait décidé de les emmener avec elle à Saint-Vincent, les enfants auraient joui de tous les avantages que procure la citoyenneté saint-vincentaise et auraient pu y poursuivre leurs études. L'agente a ajouté que la demanderesse s'était déjà rendue avec ses enfants dans un pays dont elle n'avait pas la citoyenneté, et où elle a habité plusieurs années.
[12]
L'agente s'est par ailleurs penchée sur les circonstances particulières de la demanderesse. Elle a relevé que la demanderesse n'avait, lors de son premier séjour au Canada, ni demandé ni reçu une prorogation de son statut de visiteur. À l'inverse, la demanderesse avait obtenu, en Gambie, le statut de résidente. Elle avait pu, aussi bien lors de son séjour en Gambie que lors de son retour au Canada, trouver un emploi. L'agente en a inféré que la demanderesse serait capable de trouver un emploi à Saint-Vincent, ajoutant que dans son pays d'origine, la demanderesse dispose d'un réseau de soutien constitué par des membres de sa famille, y compris ses parents et ses frères et sœurs. L'agente a ajouté que la demanderesse recevait de son ancien mari une pension alimentaire, à la fois pour elle et pour ses enfants, et recevait également un soutien financier du père de son quatrième enfant.
[13]
Depuis son retour au Canada, la demanderesse avait par ailleurs présenté deux demandes de résidence permanente qui [traduction] « donnaient des détails très précis concernant sa situation au Canada, y compris son établissement, ses liens avec le Canada, l'intérêt supérieur des enfants et les difficultés auxquelles elle aurait à faire face si elle était renvoyée à Saint-Vincent ». L'agente a précisé que l'ASFC s'était montrée compréhensive quant au besoin qu'avait la demanderesse de se procurer certains documents de droit de la famille, accordant à la demanderesse plus de temps pour obtenir les ordonnances nécessaires.
[14]
L'agente a fini par conclure que la demanderesse [traduction] « avait épuisé tous les recours qui auraient pu lui permettre de demeurer légalement au Canada », ajoutant que:
[traduction]
L'examen du dossier de Mme Charles et de la preuve produite par son conseil ne me convainc pas qu'un report du renvoi de Mme Charles, quelle que soit sa durée, la pousserait à prendre les dispositions nécessaires à elle et à ses enfants pour se préparer à leur renvoi du Canada.
III.
Questions en litige
[15]
La présente demande soulève les questions suivantes:
a) Au vu de quel dossier l'agente avait-elle à se prononcer?
b) Compte tenu du dossier dont elle disposait, la décision à laquelle l'agente est parvenue était-elle raisonnable?
IV.
Norme de contrôle
[16]
La décision que prend un agent d'exécution de ne pas reporter le renvoi d'un demandeur est assujettie à la norme de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 314, au paragraphe 25). La Cour n'interviendra que si le processus décisionnel n'est ni justifié, ni transparent, ni intelligible, ou si la décision ne fait pas partie des « issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47).
V.
Analyse
A.
Le dossier au vu duquel devait se prononcer l'agente
[17]
La demanderesse affirme qu'elle avait demandé que soit reportée l'exécution de la mesure de renvoi la visant en attendant:
a) que ses enfants terminent l'année scolaire;
b) que des dispositions soient prises en vue de la garde de ses enfants;
c) qu'elle parvienne à réunir l'argent nécessaire pour survivre lors de son arrivée à Saint-Vincent;
d) que soit traitée sa plus récente demande CH.
[18]
Elle affirme que sa demande de report fondée sur les motifs a) à c) a été présentée de vive voix lors de son entrevue du 1er décembre 2011. La demanderesse affirme que sa demande écrite présentée le 9 janvier 2012, dans laquelle elle invoque le motif d), vient [traduction] « s'ajouter » à la demande qu'elle avait formulée lors de la réunion du 1er décembre 2011. La demanderesse soutient en outre que lors de l'entrevue du 12 janvier 2012, elle a réitéré sa demande de report, et qu'on ne lui a jamais dit que seules les demandes présentées par écrit seraient examinées. La demanderesse estime par conséquent que l'agente était tenue d'examiner chacune de ses demandes, et qu'elle ne l'a pas fait.
[19]
Le défendeur fait pour sa part valoir qu'aucune demande de report n'a été présentée à l'entrevue avant renvoi du 1er décembre 2011, et que l'agente n'était régulièrement saisie que des demandes de report présentées par écrit. Le défendeur ne conteste pas qu'une demande de report ait été présentée de vive voix lors de la réunion du 12 janvier 2012. Il affirme plutôt que l'agent Matadar de l'ASFC, qui a mené les entrevues en question et qui n'est pas l'agente dont la décision est en cause en l'espèce, a rejeté la demande de report présentée lors de la réunion du 12 janvier 2012 et que cette décision prise oralement n'est pas en cause en l'espèce. Cela étant, je considère que, contrairement à ce qu'affirme la demanderesse, il n'existe aucun différend quant à la manière dont doit être présentée une demande de report. Les parties sont toutes deux d'accord pour dire qu'une telle demande peut être présentée soit oralement, soit par écrit.
[20]
Le défendeur soutient par ailleurs que, dans sa décision écrite du 3 février 2012, l'agente n'était pas tenue de prendre en compte nombre des motifs ou des circonstances personnelles que la demanderesse invoque en l'espèce étant donné que ces diverses considérations n'étaient pas évoquées dans les documents produits à l'appui de la demande de report le 9 janvier 2012. Le défendeur relève en outre que ce n'est qu'après l'envoi de ces documents que la demanderesse a présenté sa troisième demande CH.
[21]
J'ai pris connaissance de l'affidavit produit par la demanderesse au sujet de la réunion du 1er décembre 2011 avec l'agent Matadar. Le premier affidavit rédigé par la demanderesse en vue de sa requête en sursis a été signé plus de deux mois après la réunion en question. Le deuxième affidavit, signé par son ami Robert Stevens, est de date très récente - soit sept mois après les événements en question. Le défendeur relève à juste titre que les deux affidavits diffèrent quant à ce qui s'est produit le 1er décembre 2011, ce qui n'est guère surprenant étant donné que ces affidavits ont été rédigés assez longtemps après la réunion. Cela étant, je leur préfère l'affidavit de l'agent Matadar.
[22]
Je suis par conséquent convaincu, étant donné la teneur des notes prises par l'agent Matadar à l'occasion des réunions du 1er décembre 2011, du 12 janvier 2012 et du 3 février 2012, qu'aucune demande de report n'a été présentée oralement à la réunion du 1er décembre 2011. Une demande de report d'une mesure de renvoi est une chose importante qui ne manquerait pas de retenir l'attention d'un agent d'exécution au courant de la procédure de renvoi. En fait, les notes consignées dans le système à la suite des réunions que l'agent Matadar a eues avec la demanderesse le 12 janvier 2012 et le 3 février 2012 font apparaître qu'à ces deux occasions l'agent Matadar a précisé qu'une demande de sursis avait été présentée oralement. Rien ne permet de penser qu'entre la réunion du 1er décembre 2011 et les réunions qui ont eu lieu au cours des deux mois suivants, il se soit produit quelque chose qui porterait à penser que l'agent Matadar n'avait pas, lors de la première réunion, été en mesure de s'apercevoir qu'une telle demande lui avait été présentée.
[23]
Je considère, par conséquent, que le dossier soumis à l'agente, qui n'avait assisté à aucune des réunions en question, ne comprenait que les observations que la demanderesse avait présentées par écrit le 9 janvier 2012 et le dossier de cette dernière.
B.
Le caractère raisonnable de la décision de l'agente
(i)
Le pouvoir discrétionnaire de l'agente
[24]
La Cour d'appel fédérale a insisté sur le fait que « le pouvoir discrétionnaire dont disposent les agents d'exécution en matière de report d'une mesure de renvoi est limité » (
Baron
, précité, au paragraphe 49). L'article 48 de la LIPR comporte, en matière d'application d'une mesure de renvoi, une obligation positive:
Mesure de renvoi
48.
(1) La mesure de renvoi est exécutoire depuis sa prise d'effet dès lors qu'elle ne fait pas l'objet d'un sursis.
Conséquence
(2) L'étranger visé par la mesure de renvoi exécutoire doit immédiatement quitter le territoire du Canada, la mesure devant être appliquée dès que les circonstances le permettent.
Enforceable removal order
48.
(1) A removal order is enforceable if it has come into force and is not stayed.
Effect
(2) If a removal order is enforceable, the foreign national against whom it was made must leave Canada immediately and it must be enforced as soon as is reasonably practicable.
[25]
L'agent chargé du renvoi peut, pour décider si « les circonstances permettent » l'application de la mesure de renvoi, prendre en compte un certain nombre de facteurs tels que la maladie, d'autres raisons s'opposant au voyage et les demandes CH qui ont été présentées en temps opportun, mais qui n'ont pas encore été réglées en raison de l'arriéré des dossiers, la scolarité des enfants, ainsi que des naissances ou décès imminents (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  7 Imm LR (3d) 141, au paragraphe 12;
Baron
, précité aux paragraphes 49 à 51;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] ACF no 295, au paragraphe 44).
[26]
Tout en reconnaissant l'existence d'un certain pouvoir discrétionnaire lorsqu'il s'agit de décider du moment où il convient d'appliquer la mesure de renvoi, la Cour et la Cour d'appel fédérale ont déclaré qu'il convient de « réserver l'exercice de ce pouvoir aux affaires où il y a des demandes ou procédures pendantes et où le défaut de différer ferait que la vie du demandeur serait menacée, ou qu'il serait exposé à des sanctions excessives ou à un traitement inhumain » (
Wang
, précité, au paragraphe 48;
Baron
, précité, au paragraphe 51). Le simple fait qu'une demande CH soit en instance, si elle n'est pas fondée sur des menaces à la sécurité d'une personne, ne peut justifier le report d'une mesure de renvoi valable (
Baron
, précité, au paragraphe 51;
Wang
, précité, au paragraphe 45).
[27]
Selon le défendeur, la demanderesse avait sollicité le report indéfini de son renvoi, ce qui dépassait les compétences de l'agente. La Cour a précisé qu'un report est « une mesure temporaire, appliquée pour composer avec un obstacle concret et sérieux à un renvoi immédiat » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] ACF no 182, au paragraphe 19;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 1035, au paragraphe 33), et qu'il n'y a rien au paragraphe 48(2) de la LIPR qui autorise à accorder un report indéfini. J'estime, cependant, que dans les observations qu'elle a présentées le 9 janvier 2012, la demanderesse ne sollicitait pas le report indéfini de son renvoi, et que l'agente était tenue d'examiner la raison de sa demande ainsi que la preuve soumise à l'appui de celle-ci (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 515, au paragraphe 18).
(ii)
Les circonstances particulières de la demanderesse
[28]
Selon la demanderesse, c'est à tort que l'agente n'a pas pris en compte les circonstances impérieuses de sa situation. Elle fait valoir, plus précisément, que l'agente n'a tenu aucun compte de ses antécédents de mauvais traitements, et de l'impact qu'ils avaient eu sur sa capacité de se préparer en vue de son renvoi. Il ressort clairement de la jurisprudence que le pouvoir discrétionnaire d'un agent d'exécution de reporter l'exécution d'une mesure de renvoi ne peut s'exercer que dans des circonstances très précises. Le report d'une mesure de renvoi doit être réservé aux affaires où le défaut de report ferait que la vie du demandeur serait menacée ou qu'il serait exposé à des sanctions excessives ou à un traitement inhumain (
Baron
, précité, au paragraphe 51;
Wang
, précité, au paragraphe 48).
[29]
Les antécédents de mauvais traitements de la demanderesse sont tragiques, mais il n'entrait pas dans les compétences discrétionnaires de l'agente d'en tenir compte pour décider s'il y avait lieu ou non de reporter le renvoi. Précisons qu'une demande de report ne doit pas être considérée comme une demande préalable à la demande CH et que l'agent d'exécution n'est pas obligé d'examiner le bien-fondé la demande CH ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 19;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] ACF no 805, au paragraphe 32; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 11). Selon moi, la demanderesse demandait alors à l'agente de se prononcer sur le bien-fondé de sa demande CH, demande qu'elle n'avait à cette époque pas encore présentée. Sur ce point, la décision de l'agente était raisonnable.
[30]
La demanderesse fait par ailleurs valoir que c'est à tort que l'agente n'a pas tenu compte du fait que si elle était renvoyée du Canada, son ancien mari pourrait demander la garde des enfants. Je reconnais qu'il peut s'agir là d'un facteur important qu'il aurait appartenu à l'agente d'apprécier, mais il n'y avait, dans dossier soumis à l'agente, rien pour confirmer la possibilité d'une telle éventualité. On ne saurait, par conséquent, reprocher à l'agente de ne pas avoir pris en compte un élément dont elle ne disposait pas.
(iii)
L'intérêt supérieur des enfants
[31]
Selon la demanderesse, c'est également à tort que l'agente n'a pas tenu compte de l'intérêt à court terme des enfants. La demanderesse affirme notamment que l'agente était tenue de prendre en compte: (i) les conséquences que son renvoi aurait pour les enfants, compte tenu de leurs incapacités et de leurs antécédents traumatiques; (ii) la probabilité qu'en son absence son ancien mari demande la garde des enfants, ou les enlève; et (iii) le temps qu'il lui faudrait et les difficultés qu'elle éprouverait pour trouver un tuteur légal à ses enfants canadiens afin de les protéger de son ancien mari. J'ai déjà conclu que l'agente n'a commis aucune erreur en ne prenant pas en compte ce que pourrait faire l'ancien mari de la demanderesse afin d'obtenir la garde des enfants, étant donné que l'agente ne disposait d'aucun élément de preuve à cet effet.
[32]
La Cour a affirmé que l'analyse de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant ne s'applique, dans le contexte d'une mesure de renvoi, que de manière restreinte aux agents d'exécution (
Baron
, précité, au paragraphe 57). Il est en effet de droit constant que « l'agent chargé du renvoi n'est pas tenu d'effectuer un examen approfondi de l'intérêt supérieur des enfants avant d'exécuter la mesure de renvoi » (
Baron
, précité, au paragraphe. 57), et que« les immigrants illégaux ne peuvent se soustraire à l'exécution d'une mesure de renvoi valide simplement parce qu'ils sont les parents d'enfants nés au Canada » (
Baron
, précité, au paragraphe. 57).
[33]
La demanderesse invoque notamment à l'appui de sa thèse la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] ACF no 1448, dans lequel la Cour a estimé qu'il est dans le mandat d'un agent d'exécution de vérifier si des dispositions ont été prises pour que l'enfant qui reste au Canada soit confié aux bons soins d'autres personnes si ses parents sont renvoyés (voir le paragraphe 40).
[34]
En l'occurrence, l'agente s'est enquise des dispositions qui avaient été prises pour le soin des trois enfants canadiens de la demanderesse dans l'hypothèse où elle déciderait de les laisser au Canada, et des possibilités qui leur seraient offertes à Saint-Vincent, si leur mère décidait de les emmener avec elle. L'agente pouvait raisonnablement conclure que la demanderesse avait eu suffisamment de temps pour organiser la garde de ses enfants canadiens. En l'absence d'éléments de preuve quant au temps qu'il faudrait pour transférer la garde, et aux complications auxquelles cela pourrait donner lieu, il était parfaitement loisible à l'agente de conclure que la demanderesse avait pris des dispositions pour le soin de ses enfants canadiens lorsqu'elle avait fait part de son désir d'en transférer la garde. En fait, comme le souligne le défendeur, l'agente a, dans ses motifs, reconnu que les dispositions en vue de la tutelle ou de la garde des enfants n'avaient pas été complétées lorsqu'elle a précisé que la demanderesse [traduction] « avait exprimé le désir de transférer la tutelle des garçons ». Je constate que c'est plusieurs mois après avoir initialement été informée qu'elle devait être à brève échéance renvoyée du Canada que la demanderesse a indiqué qu'elle préférerait laisser ses enfants canadiens ici. Je comprends fort bien la situation dans laquelle se trouvait la demanderesse, et je reconnais qu'il n'a pas dû lui être facile de prendre cette décision, mais l'agente n'a à cet égard commis aucune erreur susceptible de contrôle.
[35]
Il était par ailleurs raisonnable, de la part de l'agente, de conclure que la demanderesse a, au Canada, de la famille dont on pouvait s'attendre à ce qu'elle s'occupe des enfants. La demanderesse affirme maintenant qu'il y avait là une erreur de fait étant donné que sa tante a, depuis, quitté le Canada, et que la demanderesse n'a presque aucun contact avec les membres de sa famille qui demeurent encore ici, mais cela, l'agente n'en avait pas été clairement informée lorsqu'elle a pris sa décision. Encore une fois, on ne peut pas s'attendre à ce qu'un agent fonde sa décision sur des faits qui ne lui ont pas été communiqués.
[36]
Et enfin, je conviens avec le défendeur que la demanderesse demande que soit appliquée en espèce, dans le contexte de l'alinéa (i) ci-dessus, une analyse qui convient davantage à une demande CH.
[37]
Bref, j'estime que la décision de l'agente concernant l'intérêt supérieur des enfants était raisonnable.
(iv)
Les erreurs
[38]
Et enfin, la demanderesse soutient que l'agente a mal interprété ses observations et qu'elle est parvenue à des conclusions de fait déraisonnables. Je me suis déjà prononcé sur les arguments de la demanderesse concernant le soutien que sa famille est susceptible de lui apporter au Canada, et sur la question de la tutelle de ses enfants. Le dernier argument avancé par la demanderesse concerne la prise en compte par l'agente de sa situation financière et de ses antécédents de travail. La demanderesse fait plus précisément valoir que l'agente a, au vu de ses antécédents professionnels, incorrectement apprécié sa capacité à subvenir à ses besoins. Je ne saurais retenir les arguments de la demanderesse. Compte tenu des éléments qui lui étaient présentés, l'agente a procédé à une évaluation raisonnable des compétences et antécédents professionnels de la demanderesse. Le curriculum vitæ de la demanderesse rend compte de ses antécédents professionnels et des fonctions qu'elle a exercées dans chacun de ses emplois. Dans sa demande de permis de travail, la demanderesse se présente comme [traduction] « très qualifiée ».
[39]
Il était également raisonnable, de la part de l'agente, de conclure qu'à Saint-Vincent la demanderesse pourrait trouver un soutien auprès de sa mère, en particulier à la lumière du fait que la lettre de sa mère, versée au dossier à titre d'affidavit, n'avait pas été communiquée à l'agente.
[40]
Faute de preuve que, depuis l'ordonnance rendue par un tribunal de l'Ontario en juillet 2011, l'ancien mari de la demanderesse ne respecte pas ses obligations alimentaires, il était également, de la part de l'agente, raisonnable de conclure que la demanderesse disposait là d'une source de revenus. Mais, même s'il y a eu sur ce point une erreur, le montant de la pension alimentaire n'est pas un élément essentiel de la décision de l'agente et il n'y a donc pas eu, à cet égard, d'erreur susceptible de contrôle.
VI.
Conclusion
[41]
Pour les motifs ci-dessus exposés, je conclus que la décision de l'agente était raisonnable.
JUGEMENT
[42]
LA COUR STATUE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.

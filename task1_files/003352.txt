 Gibson, J. 
 : This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division (the "CRDD") of the Immigration and Refugee Board wherein the CRDD determined the applicants not to be Convention refugees within the meaning of the  
 Immigration Act 
  (R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2). The decision of the CRDD is dated the 9th day of August 1993.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  The applicants are husband and wife and their child. They are all citizens of Venezuela. They base their claim to Convention refugee status on an alleged well-founded fear of persecution if they are required to return to Venezuela, by reason of their political opinion. In her Personal Information Form, the female claimant indicated that her claim is based upon that of her husband. The same applies with respect to the claim of the child.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The claimants allege that two series of events in Venezuela underlie their fear of persecution. The first commenced with the male applicant's employment at the Central University of Venezuela in October 1987. Through his employment, the male applicant had the opportunity to associate with university students, some of whom were politically active. He became a close friend of one student who introduced the male applicant to the ideals of communism, especially as Karl Marx had envisioned it. These associations led to the male applicant's participation in anti-government demonstrations.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  The first such demonstration that the male applicant participated in took place in the summer of 1987. There were no negative repercussions for the male applicant but many demonstrators were wounded when the police opened fire on the crowd.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  In nation-wide demonstrations that took place early in 1989, the male applicant again participated. He was arrested for his participation by the DISIP, a security agency. He was jailed, interrogated and beaten. He was released after one day with a warning that serious consequences would result if he were caught again in another anti-government demonstration.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  In July 1990, the male applicant was stopped on the street by two DISIP officers. The male applicant was carrying the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. He was arrested, detained and beaten to a degree that he described as torture. This detention lasted for four days.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  He again took part in a demonstration in early September 1990, when he learned that his close friend from the university had been arrested and imprisoned indefinitely as a political prisoner. Although on this occasion he was not caught by the authorities, he felt compelled to hide out over night following the demonstration. When he returned to his sister's house the next day, he was advised by his wife that her father's house, in which the couple had been living, had been destroyed. The adult applicants secretly went to examine the house. They found the walls "littered with bullet holes" and furniture destroyed. A note on the wall indicated "we will find you Ruiz". It was at that point that the applicants undertook to leave Venezuela.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  The second series of events commenced in October, 1988, when the female applicant's parents were killed in an automobile accident. The driver of the other car had been drunk at the time of the accident. He was a high-profile, well-connected businessman. Although he was initially jailed, he was shortly released. In January of 1989, the adult applicants commenced legal action against him. In July of 1989, an initial hearing was held in connection with the legal action. Shortly thereafter, the applicants began to receive telephone threats with consistent demands for them to drop their legal action. In August of 1989, the female applicant was attacked on the street. In the result she was hospitalized for two days. During the attack, she was warned that unless the applicants dropped their case against the businessman, worse would follow. The applicants alleged that DISIP officers carried out the attack demonstrating the close relationship between the businessman and government authorities.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  The applicants arrived at Pearson International Airport on the 30th day of September, 1990. They were held in detention overnight. The next day, they were interviewed by an examining immigration officer at their port of entry. The immigration officer's notes of the interview were before the CRDD at the applicants' hearing. The immigration officer herself was present at the hearing to identify the notes and respond to questioning. In its reasons for decision, the CRDD sets out the following:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "With respect to the male claimant, her (the immigration officer's) notes run inter alia as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 'Subject arrived at LBP/A Terminal 2 Toronto from Caracas, Venezuela on 30 September, 1990, ... he has stated his intention to claim Refugee status and live permanently in Canada ... subject says he is a refugee because his wife's parents were killed in a car accident two years ago. He then married his present wife in order to look after her and her younger siblings (19-10-4) at present. He was a student and has been unable to find a permanent job to support the family. His in-laws left very little in the way of material items to support the family. When he and his wife tried to contact the other party involved in the car accident, they found out he was from a well-to-do family. When they contacted his family, the family threatened them unless they left them alone. Their last contact with this other party was one year ago. They (he and his wife) have been planning this trip for approximately one year. They decided on Canada because they did not need a visa to come here and work. He and his wife want to make a better life for themselves and for the rest of the family. They are not afraid to work hard and the Venezuelan Government has done nothing to help them. He replied NO to all statutory questions and also responded relatively when questioned if he and his wife had been persecuted for their race, religion, political beliefs, or particular social group. Neither he nor his wife have ever been arrested, detained, imprisoned, harmed or tortured by any Government or the police or military of any country including Venezuela.'  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Amongst the 'statutory' questions asked were if the male claimant had 'any political affiliations, membership in any party, participation in any movements, activity in any protest group, dealings with revolutionary organizations and involvement with any terrorist groups'. Each of these categories are circled 'no'. The male claimant also said that he had no problems either with the police or with the military in his country. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [10] 
  Clearly there is a conflict between the applicants' story as set out in the narrative portion of the male applicant's Personal Information Form and in oral testimony before the CRDD and that contained in the notes quoted above.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  In a psychiatric report dated the 3rd day of April, 1992, which appears in the tribunal record (Tribunal record, pp. 340-342.), Dr. Donald E. Payne expresses his opinion that the male applicant "... is suffering from a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder which is consistent with his history of detentions, torture and fear for his life in Venezuela". The history of detentions, torture and fear for his life referred to by Dr. Payne and narrated in his letter, is entirely consistent with the narrative portion of the male applicant's Personal Information Form and his oral testimony before the CRDD.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  The CRDD commented on the conflicting evidence before it in the following terms:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The Statements to the Examining Officer thus portrayed him (the male applicant) as an apolitical individual; the PIF anything but apolitical. The male claimant, in his defence, stated that he was very tired and not in a normal state of mind. His journey, he said, had been a long one. He did not know who to trust, believing that the Venezuelan government may have infiltrated officialdom in Canada. He had thus kept his political problems to himself. We do not accept this explanation. The journey had taken only seven hours or so and the claimants were questioned on the day following their arrival. That he was mistrustful is no reason why he should not have given the right answers to what were essentially straight-forward questions. He had a sense of what the word refugee is, the notes revealing this reply 'when someone is after you, you come to another country and ask for help'. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [13] 
  After commenting on the motivation of the Examining Officer to report honestly, on the fact that the male applicant swore to the truth of the statements in his Personal Information Form and the fact that the statement given to the Examining Officer was unsworn, the CRDD went on in the following terms:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "We have also considered the reports prepared by Dr. Donald Payne. Dr. Payne identified certain symptoms in the male claimant; these symptoms are consistent, he stated, with the claimant's tale of detention and mistreatment. Dr. Payne based his conclusion on what he was told by the male claimant. We do not accept his conclusion as we do not accept a significant part of the male claimant's testimony. We have been given no satisfactory explanation during these proceedings as to why the notes of the Examining Officer are other than correct. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [14] 
  Two points are worthy of note: first, in referring to the circumstances surrounding the male applicant's explanation for the statement given to the Examining Officer, no mention is made of the fact that the applicants were held in detention overnight before their meeting with the Examining Officer; second, the CRDD states that Dr. Payne based his conclusion, his psychiatric opinion, "... on what he was told by the male claimant". This, ignores the following paragraph in Dr. Payne's report:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "On examination he presented as a tense and depressed 23 year old man who could provide a good history of his experiences in Venezuela. Although he remain (sic) tense throughout the session, he was able to keep himself in emotional control. His manner of reporting his history and his emotional reactions while reporting it were consistent with the history which he provided. There was no evidence of any major (psychotic) psychiatric disorder. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 Thus, the CRDD ignored the fact that Dr. Payne based his diagnosis, not simply on what he was told by the male applicant, but also on his trained, professional observation of the male applicant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)), I stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The Tribunal also rejected the evidence of Dr. Payne, who treated the Applicant for post-traumatic stress disorder on the basis that the doctor received all his information directly from the applicant, and therefore '... [the Tribunal] cannot conclude that Doctor Payne collaborated [corroborated] specifically, the incidents that Mr. Gill related'." [see pp. 194-200]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Man.R.(2d) 1; [1990] 4 W.W.R. 1; 55 C.C.C.(3d) 97; 76 C.R.(3d) 329, at pp. 870-871), Madam Justice Wilson stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Where expert evidence is tendered in such fields as engineering or pathology, the paucity of the lay person's knowledge is uncontentious. The longstanding recognition that psychiatric or psychological testimony also falls within the realm of expert evidence is predicated on the realization that in some circumstances the average person may not have sufficient knowledge of or experience with human behaviour to draw an appropriate inference from the facts before him or her. ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [16] 
  If the CRDD had here accepted Dr. Payne's professional opinion, based as it was, not simply on the facts related to him by the male applicant but also on his professional observation, it would then have been required to turn to a paper prepared by Dr. Payne dated the 27th day of March, 1989, and revised in November 1992 (Tribunal record, pp. 327-330.), which clearly indicates that the explanation provided by the male applicant for the different stories he told in relation to his and his family's experiences in Venezuela was entirely consistent with the reactions of a person suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  I conclude that the CRDD erred in its cavalier dismissal of the professional opinion of Dr. Payne. In so doing, it is apparent that it led itself to disregard the paper prepared by Dr. Payne and referred to above which is entitled "Psychological Problems of Torture Victims at Refugee Interviews and Hearings". It thus failed to take into account material evidence that was before it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)), where he stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "It appears, therefore, that the Board, in making its decision, has not had regard to the totality of the evidence properly before it. It has, therefore, erred in law. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [18] 
  I conclude that, in the case before me, in its treatment of the explanation by the male applicant of the differing stories regarding his experiences in Venezuela, of the professional opinion of Dr. Payne and of the paper prepared by Dr. Payne, the CRDD erred in law. I have therefore set aside the decision. While, if the totality of the evidence before the CRDD had been appropriately dealt with, the CRDD might have reached the same conclusion, that is not the issue. The CRDD must give appropriate weight to professional opinion directly related to the applicant before it and to documentary evidence that, read together with the professional opinion, is corroborative of the position of the applicants or, put another way, that reflects the impact of the case specific professional opinion.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [19] 
  On another aspect of the CRDD's decision, the CRDD found no nexus between the private dispute between the applicants on the one hand and a businessman on the other, and a Convention refugee ground. Further, it concluded that it had not been shown why it was objectively unreasonable for the claimants not to turn to the police for protection against the high-profile businessman when they required it. There was evidence before the CRDD that the high-profile businessman had close ties to the police and to the DISIP. There was also evidence that the attack on the female applicant was carried out by officers of the DISIP. This evidence was not found to be not credible. The CRDD should have dealt with the issue of whether this evidence provides a nexus to a Convention refugee ground, that is, membership in a particular social group, and whether it constituted a reasonable basis for the failure of the applicants to seek protection from the police in their difficulties with the high-profile businessman.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  I consulted counsel on the issue of whether or not a serious question of general importance warranting certification by me arises out of this matter. Counsel for the applicants took the position that, if my decision were to go against the applicants, a question should be certified on the issue of the probative value of professional psychological opinions. It is clear that, if such a question is a serious question of general importance, it remains so regardless of the result. Specific wording of a question was not provided to me. Counsel for the respondent took the position that no question should be certified. I agree with the position of counsel for the respondent. No question is certified.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

[1]
Hughes, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of a Member of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated July 9, 2013, wherein the Applicant's claim for refugee protection was denied.
[2]
The Applicant is an adult female person born in India in January, 1984. She is of Tibetan ancestry. Her parents were born in Tibet and fled that country to reside in India at the time when Tibet was taken over by China.
[3]
The Applicant left India, came to the United States and subsequently, in April 2013, to Canada where she made a claim for refugee protection. A Member of the Immigration and Refugee Board held a hearing and subsequently, in the decision under review, rejected the claim for refugee protection. In so doing, the Member stated, at paragraph 30, of the reasons for the Decision
:
[30] The claimant was asked what she feared if returned to India. She testified deportation to China. The claimant has not alleged any persecution or harm at the hands of Indian authorities other then deportation due to a lack of citizenship to China. As the panel has found that she is either a citizen of India or has a right to citizenship, the panel will not address her fear of returning to China.
[4]
The determination of the Member was summarized at paragraph 4 of the Decision
:
[4] After considering the totality of evidence including representation and case law, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient and credible evidence to discharge her onus and to establish that the sole country of reference should be China. The panel finds that the claimant country of reference should include India and the panel has determined that the claimant is not a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and also that she is not a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The panel finds that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to India.
FACTS
[5]
There are certain uncontested findings of fact made by the Member:
• the Applicant was born in India in January 1984;
• the Applicant is of Tibetan descent, both her parents were Tibetan; they fled to India when China assumed control of Tibet;
• the Applicant possesses a genuine Indian birth certificate issued by the Karnataka State Government. The Applicant presented this document to the Canadian authorities when she sought entry into Canada;
• the Applicant presented a Tibetan Green Book to the Canadian authorities when she sought entry into Canada. This document is of no value in proving or determining citizenship;
• the Applicant presented a Registration Certificate [RC] to the Canadian authorities upon seeking entry into Canada. Such a document is required of those of Tibetan ancestry seeking to work and travel and remain in India. The Member doubted the genuineness of this document;
• the Applicant entered Canada from the United States;
• upon entry into the United States, the Applicant presented an Indian passport. The Applicant no longer had the passport when she sought entry into Canada. The Applicant alleged that the passport was fraudulent. The Member held that it was not;
• while the Applicant did not have the full privileges of citizenship in India, she could not vote or hold certain government jobs, it was possible to for her to apply for full citizenship. The degree of difficulty in seeking citizenship and likelihood of securing citizenship is disputed;
• the Applicant made no attempt to secure Indian citizenship;
• the Member did not examine the risk as to whether the Applicant would be likely to have been deported to China by the authorities in India;
• the Applicant indicated in the relevant documents presented to the Canadian authorities that the country of reference in respect of which she feared return was Tibet (China);
• the Member did not address the Applicant's fear of returning to China.
ISSUES
[6]
Having reviewed the materials filed and the arguments of Counsel at the hearing, which were excellent and I thank them both, the issues emerge as follows:
1. What is the standard of review?
2. Did the Member determine that the Applicant was a citizen of India and, if so, was that determination reasonable?
3. Did the Member properly find that, if the Applicant was not a citizen of India, she should at least have made an effort to apply to become a citizen?
4. Should the Member have examined whatever evidence there was so as to determine whether the Applicant would likely have been deported from India to China?
5. Should the Member have examined the fear of risk in China?
DISCUSSION
1.
Standard of Review
[7]
The standard of review of the Member's decision is that of correctness where determinations of law were made, and reasonableness where determinations of fact were made with particular deference where determinations as to credibility were made. The application of determinations of fact to the law, if the law is correctly stated, is reviewed on as standard of reasonableness.
2.
Did the Member determine whether the Applicant was a citizen of India and, if so, was that decision reasonable?
[8]
Counsel do not agree as to whether the Member made a determination as to whether the Applicant was a citizen of India or not. The Member's reasons state the following at paragraphs 7 and 19 respectively:
17. For the following reasons, the panel finds that the claimant is a citizen of India.
19. The panel finds, based on the totality of the evidence, that the claimant is a citizen of India and not China.
[9]
These statements are quite clear. However, from paragraphs 20 to 30, the Member considered whether the Applicant could acquire citizenship in India and, if so, what is the degree of difficulty and the likelihood of success, and the impact of the fact that the Applicant never even tried to obtain such citizenship. The Member concluded at paragraph 30 of the reasons:
As the panel had found that she is either a citizen of India or has a right of citizenship, the panel will not address her fear of returning to China.
[10]
It is clear that the consideration as to whether the Applicant could apply for citizenship was made by the Member as
an alternative
to the finding that the Applicant did have citizenship in India so as to address submissions made by Counsel. At paragraph 21 of the reasons, the Member wrote:
In the alternative, the panel has considered counsel's submission that Tibetans born in India do not have a right of citizenship, that it would be costly, there are legal barriers and barriers adduced by the CTA…
[11]
I am satisfied that the Member made a clear finding that the Applicant was a citizen of India. The question then becomes whether that finding was reasonable.
[12]
There is no question that the Applicant was born in India and resided there until she came to Canada via the United States. The Applicant was in possession of an Indian birth certificate, the genuineness of which is not in question.
[13]
The dispute concerned the Indian passport which no longer exists. The Applicant had the document to obtain a United States visa and to enter the United States. It was not on her person when she entered Canada. The Applicant alleges that the passport was false.
[14]
Counsel for each of the parties agreed that possession of a genuine passport creates a rebuttable presumption that the bearer is a citizen of the country issuing the passport.
[15]
The Member wrote an extensive analysis respecting the genuineness of the missing passport at paragraphs 12 to 15 of the reasons. The Member concluded by not believing the Applicant's assertions that the passport was not genuine.
[16]
I find that the Member's findings are reasonable respecting the genuineness of the passport.
[17]
Further, I find that, given the totality of the evidence, including the birth certificate and the passport, the Member's findings that the Applicant was a citizen of India is reasonable.
3.
Did the Member properly find that, if the Applicant was not a citizen of India, she should at least have made an effort to become a citizen?
[18]
As I have previously found, the Member considered this matter in the alternative. The Member, properly as I have held, found that the Applicant was a citizen of India. Since the argument, both written and oral, before me was substantial on this point, I will address it. Clearly, however, my comments in this regard are
obiter
.
[19]
A proper discussion of the law begins with the discussion of the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . That decision recites the common ground between the parties, at paragraph 19, that refugee protection will be denied where citizenship in a safe country could be secured by "mere formalities". The question addressed was at what level could such formalities rise before they are not "mere". Décary JA for the Court adopted the phrase "power within the control of the applicant" as a better expression of the test. He wrote at paragraph 22:
I fully endorse the reasons for judgment of Rothstein J., and in particular the following passage at page 77
:
The condition of not having a country of nationality must be one that is beyond the power of the applicant to control.
The true test, in my view, is the following: if it is within the control of the applicant to acquire the citizenship of a country with respect to which he has no well-founded fear of persecution, the claim for refugee status will be denied. While words such as "acquisition of citizenship in a non-discretionary manner" or "by mere formalities" have been used, the test is better phrased in terms of "power within the control of the applicant" for it encompasses all sorts of situations, it prevents the introduction of a practice of "country shopping" which is incompatible with the "surrogate" dimension of international refugee protection recognized in Ward and it is not restricted, contrary to what counsel for the respondent has suggested, to mere technicalities such as filing appropriate documents. This "control" test also reflects the notion which is transparent in the definition of a refugee that the "unwillingness" of an applicant to take steps required from him to gain state protection is fatal to his refugee claim unless that unwillingness results from the very fear of persecution itself. Paragraph 106 of the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status emphasizes the point that whenever "available, national protection takes precedence over international protection," and the Supreme Court of Canada, in Ward, observed, at p. 752, that "[w] hen available, home state protection is a claimant's sole option."
[20]
Subsequent cases addressed what might or might not be within the control of the Applicant. Justice Lemieux of this Court, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  wrote at paragraph 21 that where an authority was not compelled to grant citizenship, that was a matter beyond the Applicant's control:
The determining error the tribunal made was to trespass upon forbidden territory when, after recognizing the authorities in Guyana were not compelled on her application to grant Mrs. Khan citizenship, it (the tribunal) could opine how the Minister in Guyana might exercise the discretion conferred upon him. Such circumstances are not within her control. Mrs. Khan is not obligated to seek Guyana's protection before she seeks Canada's.
[21]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the same Justice Lemieux, in dealing with re-acquisition of citizenship, found at paragraph 40 of his Reasons that, while not automatic, easily obtained re-acquisition could preclude a claim for refugee protection:
In my view, this application for judicial review must be dismissed. In short, the tribunal was not satisfied the applicants had discharged their onus of showing (on the assumption they had lost their status which the tribunal doubted and was supported by the RIR indicating that status was indefinite unless cancelled for reasons not relevant in this case), such loss could not be repaired by administrative reacquisition albeit perhaps not automatic, but easily obtained without return to China. On the evidence, before the tribunal, such conclusion was open to it. In fact, by using the Williams control test, it imposed a more stringent test than the jurisprudence requires - the jurisprudence only requires an applicant who has let his/her status expire to show good reasons failing to prevent such happening.
[22]
Justice Russell of this Court, in
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  considered whether an Applicant was under any obligation to apply for citizenship. He held that the Board was correct in holding that the Applicant had no such obligation. He wrote at paragraphs 117 to 121:
117. There was evidence before the Board to demonstrate that it was not within the control of the Respondents to acquire Chinese citizenship, which is the test dictated by Williams. The children alone would cause them all kinds of problems and Shirley gave evidence that she might also be subjected to forced sterilization.
118. The Applicant wants to push this issue further to say that the Respondents should have been required to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that, if they applied, they would not be granted Chinese citizenship. In fact, at the refugee hearing and as part of this application, the Applicant also argued that the Respondents were under an obligation to show that they had applied for, and had been refused, Chinese citizenship.
119. This argument was, in my view, correctly rejected by the Board as being contrary to Williams. But it does show where the Applicant wants to push this issue. In my view, to go beyond Williams in order to do what the Applicant wants to do would impose an intolerable burden upon people in the position of the Respondents.
120. It is certainly within the control of the Respondents to submit an application for Chinese citizenship but, on the evidence, it was not within the control of the Respondents to acquire Chinese citizenship, and the evidence suggested to the Board that they faced serious problems in doing so.
121. In my view, then, the Board correctly applied Williams to the facts of this case. I can find no error of law on this point and the conclusion, reached by applying the law to the facts, falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
[23]
Justice Near (as he was then) of the Federal Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in dealing with a remigrant situation found that citizenship, if lost, could be reobtained, thus precluding a refugee claim. He wrote at paragraphs 34 and 35:
34. In my opinion, this case is distinguishable on the facts. In Khan, above, the Board discussed whether the Applicant could obtain Guyanese citizenship after marrying a Guyanese citizen. She had never independently obtained Guyanese citizenship in the past. In the present case, the Applicant is a Guyanese citizen by birth and has never officially renounced her citizenship. Even if she is not a Guyanese citizen anymore because of her dual citizenship, she could obtain remigrant status. As such, unlike in Khan, above, the Board did not provide its opinion on whether the Guyanese authorities would exercise their discretion to refuse citizenship to the Applicant.
35. The decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , should be followed. Since it is "within the control of the [A]pplicant to acquire the citizenship of a country with respect to which [she] has no well-founded fear of persecution," the Applicant should seek protection in her other country of nationality, Guyana, before seeking protection in Canada. Consequently, the Board did not err in its conclusion.
[24]
A case that closely parallels this one is the decision of Justice O'Reilly of this Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The facts were similar to those here where a person born in India, of Tibetan descent, sought refugee protection in Canada. The question was whether obtaining Indian citizenship was beyond his control. Justice O'Reilly wrote at paragraphs 8 to 11:
8. The Minister points out that under the Indian Citizenship Act, s 3.1, a person born in India between January 26, 1950 and July 1, 1987 is a citizen of India. This was recognized by the Indian High Court in Dolkar. Accordingly, the Minister argues that it was within Mr. Wanchuk's power to obtain citizenship in India and, therefore, the Board's decision was not unreasonable (citing Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Further, even though Mr. Wanchuk would have to obtain a letter of "no objection" from the CTA prior to applying for Indian citizenship, the evidence showed that the CTA would not withhold its approval.
9. In my view, the documentary evidence shows that obtaining Indian citizenship was not within Mr. Wanchuk's control:
• The Dolkar decision applies only in New Delhi; it amounts to persuasive authority in other regions of India, but is not binding there.
•
No grants of citizenship to Tibetans have been made in the three years following Dolkar.
• The official position of the CTA is that it will not withhold approval to Tibetans seeking Indian citizenship. However, in reality, the CTA is reluctant to grant approval, believing that Tibetans in India should remain refugees so as to ensure that they will eventually return to an independent Tibet.
10. In my view, this evidence shows a mere possibility that Mr. Wanchuk could obtain Indian citizenship. It would require, at a minimum, that the CTA exercise its discretion not to withhold its approval and that Indian authorities recognize Dolkar as binding precedent. In fact, Mr. Wanchuk might well have to litigate the issue. I note that Ms. Dolkar expended several years in administrative and legal battles in order to obtain Indian citizenship.
11. In these circumstances, I find the Board's conclusion that obtaining Indian citizenship was within Mr. Wanchuk's control was unreasonable.
[25]
Justice O'Reilly did not address the question as to whether the Applicant Wanchuk should at least have made an attempt to secure citizenship.
[26]
In the present case, the Member stated at paragraph 27 of the reasons:
The panel finds that the claimant bears the onus of establishing that citizenship was sought and refused by Indian authorities.
[27]
I agree with Counsel for the Applicant here that no Canadian authority states that an Applicant must first seek and then be refused citizenship in a safe country where they are entitled to do so before claiming refugee status in Canada. In fact, Justice Russell in
Ma
, previously referred to, approved the rejection of the Board of such proposition as an "intolerable burden".
[28]
Nonetheless, it is disturbing that, in a case such as the present, where the Applicant was born in India and peaceably living there, she took absolutely no steps to acquire full Indian citizenship. Certainly, if reasonable steps had been taken and pursued, a failure to secure such citizenship would have gone a long way toward bolstering a claim for refugee protection in Canada.
[29]
With all due respect to Justice Russell, there is nothing in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that says an Applicant need not even apply for citizenship. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 22, speaks to whether it is within the control of a person
to acquire
citizenship. Nothing in that case encourages an Applicant not to make reasonable efforts to secure such citizenship.
[30]
Wilful neglect or even neglect to apply for citizenship where a person has a right to apply should not serve as an invitation to try your luck in Canada. There would be good grounds for a certified question if the issue was not
obiter
. As this discussion is
obiter
, as I have found that the finding that the Applicant had Indian citizenship was reasonable, I will not certify a question.
4. Should the Member have examined whatever evidence there was so as to determine whether the Applicant would likely have been deported from India to China?
- and -
5. Should the Member have examined the fear of risk in China?
[31]
Since the Member found that the Applicant was a citizen of India, there was no need to make such examinations.
JUDGMENT
[32]
FOR THE REASONS PROVIDED
:
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that:
1. The application is dismissed;
2. No question is certified;
3. No Order as to costs.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire visant la décision datée du 9 juillet 2013 par laquelle un commissaire de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a rejeté la demande d'asile présentée par la demanderesse.
[2]
La demanderesse est née en Inde en janvier 1984. Elle est d'origine tibétaine. Ses parents sont nés au Tibet et ils ont fui ce pays pour se réfugier en Inde en vue de s'y établir à l'époque où la Chine a pris contrôle du Tibet.
[3]
La demanderesse a quitté l'Inde; elle est allée aux États-Unis et, par la suite en avril 2013, au Canada, où elle a présenté une demande d'asile. Un commissaire de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a tenu une audience et il a par la suite, dans la décision visée par la demande de contrôle judiciaire, rejeté la demande d'asile. Ce faisant, le commissaire a mentionné ce qui suit, au paragraphe 30 des motifs de la décision:
[30] La demandeure d'asile s'est vu demander de dire ce qu'elle craignait si elle retournait en Inde. Elle a témoigné craindre d'être expulsée vers la Chine. La demandeure d'asile n'a allégué aucune persécution ou aucun préjudice de la part des autorités indiennes outre la crainte d'être expulsée vers la Chine du fait qu'elle n'est pas citoyenne indienne. Comme le tribunal a conclu que la demandeure d'asile est citoyenne indienne ou qu'elle a droit à la citoyenneté indienne, il ne se penchera pas sur sa crainte de retourner en Chine.
[4]
Le commissaire a résumé sa décision de la manière suivante, au paragraphe 4 de la décision:
[4] Après avoir examiné l'ensemble des éléments de preuve, dont les observations et la jurisprudence, le tribunal estime que la demandeure d'asile n'a pas fourni des preuves crédibles suffisantes pour s'acquitter de son fardeau de preuve et établir que le seul pays de référence est la Chine. Le tribunal est d'avis que l'Inde doit aussi être un pays de référence et a conclu que la demandeure d'asile n'a qualité ni de réfugié au sens de la Convention au sens de l'article 96 de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés ni de personne à protéger au sens de l'article 97 de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés. Le tribunal conclut que la demandeure d'asile ne s'est pas acquittée du fardeau de prouver qu'il existe une possibilité sérieuse qu'elle soit persécutée pour l'un des motifs prévus dans la Convention ou, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, qu'elle soit personnellement exposée à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités, ou encore au risque d'être soumise à la torture à son retour en Inde.
LES FAITS
[5]
Le commissaire a tiré certaines conclusions de fait qui ne sont pas contestées:
• La demanderesse est née en Inde en janvier 1984;
• La demanderesse est d'origine tibétaine et ses deux parents étaient Tibétains; ceux-ci ont fui la Chine en direction de l'Inde après que la Chine eut pris contrôle du Tibet;
• La demanderesse détient un acte de naissance authentique de l'Inde délivré par le gouvernement de l'État du Karnataka. La demanderesse a présenté ce document aux autorités canadiennes lorsqu'elle a demandé l'entrée au Canada;
• La demanderesse a présenté un livre vert du Tibet aux autorités canadiennes lorsqu'elle a demandé l'entrée au Canada. Ce document n'a aucune valeur pour ce qui est de prouver ou d'établir la citoyenneté;
• La demanderesse a présenté un certificat d'inscription [CI] aux autorités canadiennes lorsqu'elle a demandé l'entrée au Canada. Un tel document est nécessaire pour les personnes d'origine tibétaine qui cherchent du travail, qui voyagent et qui restent en Inde. Le commissaire a douté de l'authenticité de ce document;
• La demanderesse est entrée au Canada en provenance des États-Unis;
• La demanderesse a présenté un passeport indien à son entrée aux États-Unis. La demanderesse n'avait plus ce passeport lorsqu'elle a demandé l'entrée au Canada. La demanderesse a allégué qu'il s'agissait d'un passeport frauduleux. Le commissaire a statué que ce n'était pas le cas;
• Bien que la demanderesse ne jouissait pas de l'ensemble des privilèges de la citoyenneté en Inde, qu'elle ne pouvait pas voter ni occuper certains postes au sein du gouvernement, il lui était possible de présenter une demande en vue d'obtenir une citoyenneté complète. Le degré de difficulté se rapportant à cette demande, ainsi qu'à la probabilité d'obtenir la citoyenneté, sont contestés;
• La demanderesse n'a pas tenté d'obtenir la citoyenneté indienne;
• Le commissaire ne s'est pas penché sur le risque quant à savoir si la demanderesse serait exposée à être expulsée en Chine par les autorités indiennes;
• La demanderesse a mentionné, dans les documents pertinents qu'elle a présentés aux autorités canadiennes, que le pays de référence à l'égard duquel elle craignait de retourner était le Tibet (Chine);
• Le commissaire n'a pas traité de la crainte de la demanderesse à retourner en Chine.
LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE
[6]
Après examen des documents produits et des arguments, excellents par ailleurs, présentés par les avocats lors de l'audience, et pour lesquels je les remercie, les questions en litige soulevées par la présente affaire sont les suivantes:
1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?
2. Le commissaire a-t-il conclu que la demanderesse était une citoyenne indienne et, le cas échéant, s'agissait-il d'une conclusion raisonnable?
3. Le commissaire a-t-il conclu à juste titre que, dans l'éventualité où la demanderesse n'était pas une citoyenne de l'Inde, qu'elle aurait au moins dû faire un effort pour présenter une demande en vue d'acquérir la citoyenneté?
4. Le commissaire aurait-il dû examiner tout élément de preuve lui permettant d'établir si la demanderesse aurait été exposée à un renvoi en Chine à partir de l'Inde?
5. Le commissaire aurait-il dû examiner la crainte de la demanderesse d'être exposée à un risque en Chine?
DISCUSSION
1.
La norme de contrôle applicable
[7]
La norme de contrôle applicable à l'égard des conclusions de droit tirées par le commissaire dans sa décision est celle de la décision correcte. La norme de la raisonnabilité s'applique à l'égard des conclusions de fait qu'il y a tirées; il convient toutefois de faire preuve d'une certaine déférence en ce qui concerne les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité. L'application des conclusions de fait au droit, dans la mesure où le droit est bien énoncé, doit être examinée selon la norme de la raisonnabilité.
2.
Le commissaire a-t-il conclu que la demanderesse était une citoyenne indienne et, le cas échéant, s'agissait-il d'une conclusion raisonnable?
[8]
Les avocats ne s'entendent pas quant à savoir si le commissaire s'est prononcé quant à la question de la citoyenneté indienne de la demanderesse. Les motifs du commissaire contiennent les passages suivants, aux paragraphes 7 et 19 respectivement:
17. [...] Pour les motifs qui suivent, le tribunal conclut que la demandeure d'asile est une citoyenne indienne.
19. [...] Le tribunal est d'avis, d'après l'ensemble des éléments de preuve, que la demandeure d'asile est une citoyenne indienne et non une citoyenne chinoise.
[9]
Ces énoncés sont plutôt clairs. Cependant, du paragraphe 20 au paragraphe 30 de ses motifs, le commissaire s'est penché sur la question de savoir si la demanderesse pouvait acquérir la citoyenneté en Inde et, le cas échéant, sur le degré de difficulté de cette démarche et ses probabilités de réussite, ainsi que sur l'incidence du fait que la demanderesse n'avait jamais tenté d'obtenir la citoyenneté. Le commissaire a tiré la conclusion suivante au paragraphe 30 des motifs:
[...] Comme le tribunal a conclu que la demandeure d'asile est citoyenne indienne ou qu'elle a droit à la citoyenneté indienne, il ne se penchera pas sur sa crainte de retourner en Chine.
[10]
Il est évident que l'examen quant à la question de savoir si la demanderesse pouvait présenter une demande de citoyenneté a été effectué par le commissaire
à titre subsidiaire
à la conclusion selon laquelle la demanderesse avait bel et bien la citoyenneté indienne, en vue de traiter des observations présentées par le conseil. Au paragraphe 21 des motifs, le commissaire a écrit ce qui suit:
Subsidiairement, le tribunal a pris acte de l'observation de la conseil selon laquelle les Tibétains nés en Inde n'ont pas droit à la citoyenneté, qu'il serait coûteux d'obtenir la citoyenneté et qu'il faut surmonter des obstacles, tant sur le plan juridique que de la part de la CTA. [...]
[11]
Je suis convaincu que le commissaire a manifestement conclu que la demanderesse avait la citoyenneté indienne. La question devient donc de savoir si cette conclusion était raisonnable.
[12]
Il n'y a aucun doute que la demanderesse est née en Inde et qu'elle a résidé dans ce pays jusqu'à ce qu'elle vienne au Canada en provenance des États-Unis. La demanderesse avait en sa possession un acte de naissance indien, dont l'authenticité n'est pas remise en question.
[13]
Le différend avait trait au passeport indien qui n'existe plus. La demanderesse avait le document lui permettant d'obtenir un visa aux États-Unis et d'entrer dans ce pays. Elle ne l'avait pas en sa possession lors de son entrée au Canada. La demanderesse allègue que le passeport était un faux.
[14]
Les avocats des deux parties conviennent que la possession d'un passeport authentique crée une présomption simple selon laquelle son titulaire est citoyen du pays ayant délivré le passeport.
[15]
Le commissaire s'est livré à une analyse approfondie en ce qui concerne l'authenticité du passeport manquant aux paragraphes 12 à 15 des motifs. Le commissaire a conclu en mentionnant qu'il ne croyait pas les affirmations de la demanderesse selon lesquelles le passeport n'était pas authentique.
[16]
Je conclus que les conclusions du commissaire concernant l'authenticité du passeport sont raisonnables.
[17]
En outre, je conclus que compte tenu de l'ensemble de la preuve, y compris l'acte de naissance et le passeport, les conclusions du commissaire selon lesquelles la demanderesse était une citoyenne indienne étaient raisonnables.
3.
Le commissaire a-t-il conclu à juste titre que, dans l'éventualité où la demanderesse n'était pas une citoyenne de l'Inde, qu'elle aurait au moins dû faire un effort pour présenter une demande en vue d'acquérir la citoyenneté?
[18]
Comme je l'ai déclaré précédemment, le commissaire a examiné cette question à titre subsidiaire. Il a conclu, et à juste titre selon moi, que la demanderesse était une citoyenne de l'Inde. Puisque l'argument dont j'étais saisi, qui m'a été présenté autant de vive voix que par écrit, était étoffé quant à cette question, j'y répondrai. Cependant, mes commentaires ci-dessous à cet égard constituent manifestement des remarques incidentes.
[19]
Toute discussion convenable quant au droit applicable à ce sujet doit commencer avec l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  de la Cour d'appel fédérale. Cette décision reprend, au paragraphe 19, les faits convenus entre les parties, soit qu'une personne n'obtiendra pas l'asile lorsqu'elle pourra se voir octroyer la citoyenneté dans un pays sûr au moyen de « simples formalités ». La question qui était soulevée à ce stade-là était de savoir à quel degré de complexité ces formalités cessaient d'être « simples ». Le juge Décary de la Cour d'appel fédérale a adopté l'expression « pouvoir, faculté ou contrôle du demandeur » pour bien exprimer ce critère. Il a écrit ce qui suit au paragraphe 22:
Je souscris entièrement aux motifs du juge Rothstein et en particulier au passage suivant, à la page 77:
Le fait de ne pas avoir de nationalité ne doit pas relever du contrôle d'un [demandeur].
Le véritable critère est, selon moi, le suivant: s'il est en son pouvoir d'obtenir la citoyenneté d'un pays pour lequel il n'a aucune crainte fondée d'être persécuté, la qualité de réfugié sera refusée au demandeur. Bien que des expressions comme « acquisition de la citoyenneté de plein droit » ou « par l'accomplissement de simples formalités » aient été employés, il est préférable de formuler le critère en parlant de « pouvoir, faculté ou contrôle du demandeur », car cette expression englobe divers types de situations. De plus, ce critère dissuade les demandeurs d'asile de rechercher le pays le plus accommodant, une démarche qui est incompatible avec l'aspect « subsidiaire » de la protection internationale des réfugiés reconnue dans l'arrêt Ward et, contrairement à ce que l'avocat de l'intimé a laissé entendre, ce critère ne se limite pas à de simples formalités comme le serait le dépôt de documents appropriés. Le critère du « contrôle » exprime aussi une idée qui ressort de la définition du réfugié, en l'occurrence le fait que l'absence de « volonté » du demandeur à accomplir les démarches nécessaires pour obtenir la protection de l'État entraîne le rejet de sa demande d'asile à moins que cette absence s'explique par la crainte même de persécution. Le paragraphe 106 du Guide des procédures et critères à appliquer pour déterminer le statut de réfugié précise bien que « [c] haque fois qu'elle peut être réclamée, la protection nationale l'emporte sur la protection internationale ». Dans l'arrêt Ward, à la page 752, la Cour suprême du Canada fait observer, à la page 752, que « [l] orsqu'il est possible de l'obtenir, la protection de l'État d'origine est la seule solution qui s'offre à un demandeur ».
[20]
Des décisions subséquentes ont traité de ce qui pouvait ou non être du pouvoir, de la faculté ou du contrôle du demandeur. Le juge Lemieux de la Cour a écrit, au paragraphe 21 de la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  que, lorsque les autorités n'étaient pas tenues d'accepter la demande de citoyenneté, cela constituait une circonstance hors du contrôle du demandeur:
L'erreur déterminante qu'a commise le tribunal a été de faire une incursion en territoire interdit lorsque, après avoir reconnu que les autorités guyaniennes n'étaient pas tenues d'accepter la demande de citoyenneté de Mme Khan, il s'est exprimé sur la manière dont le ministre guyanien pouvait exercer le pouvoir discrétionnaire qui lui a été conféré. De telles circonstances sont hors du contrôle de la demanderesse. Mme Khan n'est pas obligée de demander la protection de la Guyana avant de demander celle du Canada.
[21]
Le même juge Lemieux, qui devait se pencher sur la question du recouvrement de la citoyenneté dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a conclu, au paragraphe 40 de ses motifs, qu'un recouvrement facile de la citoyenneté, qui n'a pas à être automatique, pouvait être suffisant pour entraîner le rejet d'une demande d'asile:
À mon avis, cette demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être rejetée. En bref, le tribunal n'a pas été persuadé que les demandeurs s'étaient acquittés de leur obligation de prouver (si l'on suppose qu'ils avaient perdu leur statut, ce dont le tribunal doutait, un doute justifié par la RDI, qui indiquait que le statut était indéfini, sauf annulation pour des raisons qui n'intéressent pas la présente affaire) qu'ils ne pouvaient pas recouvrer leur statut en se pliant à des formalités administratives, recouvrement qui n'était sans doute pas automatique, mais qui ne les obligeait pas à retourner en Chine. Au vu de la preuve, le tribunal pouvait fort bien arriver à cette conclusion. En fait, appliquant le critère du contrôle exposé dans l'arrêt Williams, il a imposé un critère plus rigoureux que ce qu'exige la jurisprudence. Selon la jurisprudence, un demandeur d'asile qui a laissé expirer son statut de résident permanent doit uniquement expliquer, en donnant une raison valable, pourquoi il n'a pas empêché son statut d'expirer.
[22]
Dans la décision
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Russell de la Cour a examiné la question de savoir si un demandeur avait une obligation de présenter une demande de citoyenneté. Il a statué que la Commission n'avait pas commis d'erreur en concluant que le demandeur n'avait pas une telle obligation. Il a écrit ce qui suit aux paragraphes 117 à 121:
117. La preuve dont a été saisie la Commission démontre que les défendeurs n'avaient pas le pouvoir d'obtenir la citoyenneté chinoise, soit le critère établi dans l'arrêt Williams. À eux seuls, les enfants seraient la source de divers problèmes et Shirley a déclaré dans son témoignage qu'elle serait probablement forcée de subir une stérilisation.
118. Le demandeur fait en outre valoir que les défendeurs sont tenus de prouver qu'il était plus probable qu'improbable que leur demande de citoyenneté en Chine serait refusée. Lors de l'audience relative à la demande d'asile et dans le cadre de la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire, le demandeur a en fait également allégué que les défendeurs étaient tenus de prouver qu'ils avaient fait une demande de citoyenneté en Chine et que cette demande avait été refusée.
119. Selon moi, c'est à bon droit que la Commission a rejeté cet argument au motif qu'il était contraire à l'arrêt Williams. Cet argument démontre toutefois vers où le demandeur veut pousser l'examen de la question. À mon avis, étendre l'examen au-delà de l'arrêt Williams afin de faire ce que le demandeur sollicite aurait pour effet d'imposer un fardeau intolérable à des personnes dans une situation telle que celle des défendeurs.
120. Les défendeurs ont certainement le pouvoir de présenter une demande de citoyenneté en Chine, mais, selon la preuve, ceux-ci n'avaient pas le pouvoir de l'obtenir et la Commission a constaté, au vu de la preuve, qu'ils ont éprouvé de grandes difficultés dans le cadre de ce processus.
121. J'estime ainsi que la Commission a appliqué correctement l'arrêt Williams aux faits d'espèce. Je ne puis déceler aucune erreur de droit sur ce point, et la conclusion tirée en appliquant le droit aux faits appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.
[23]
Le juge Near (tel était alors son titre) de la Cour fédérale a conclu, dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  qui traitait d'une rémigrante, qu'une citoyenneté perdue pouvait être obtenue à nouveau, ce qui empêchait l'acceptation d'une demande d'asile. Il a écrit ce qui suit aux paragraphes 34 et 35:
34. Selon moi, les faits de la présente espèce appellent une distinction. Dans Khan, la Commission examinait si le mariage à un citoyen du Guyana permettait à la demanderesse d'obtenir la citoyenneté de ce pays; la demanderesse n'avait jamais eu la citoyenneté guyanienne de façon indépendante. En l'espèce, la demanderesse a la citoyenneté guyanienne par sa naissance, et elle ne l'a jamais officiellement répudiée. Même dans l'hypothèse où elle ne serait plus citoyenne du Guyana du fait qu'elle possède une autre citoyenneté, elle pourrait obtenir le statut de « rémigrante ». La Commission n'a donc pas formulé d'opinion concernant l'exercice par les autorités guyaniennes de leur pouvoir de refuser la citoyenneté à la demanderesse, contrairement à ce qui s'était produit dans Khan.
35. Il y a lieu d'appliquer l'arrêt Williams, précité. Comme il est « en son pouvoir d'obtenir la citoyenneté d'un pays pour lequel [la demanderesse] n'a aucune crainte fondée d'être persécuté[e] », elle devrait se prévaloir de la protection de l'autre pays dont elle a la nationalité avant de demander celle du Canada. Par conséquent, la conclusion de la Commission n'est pas erronée.
[24]
Le juge O'Reilly de la Cour a dû examiner une affaire qui ressemblait fortement à la présente lorsqu'il a rendu la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Les faits étaient similaires à ceux en l'espèce: une personne née en Inde, d'origine ethnique tibétaine, demandait l'asile au Canada. La question était de savoir si l'obtention de la citoyenneté indienne ne relevait pas de son contrôle. Le juge O'Reilly a écrit ce qui suit aux paragraphes 8 à 11:
8. Le ministre souligne que, sous le régime de l'article 3.1 du Indian Citizenship Act, une personne née en Inde entre le 26 janvier 1950 et le 1er juillet 1987 est citoyen de l'Inde. Cela a été reconnu par la haute cour de l'Inde dans l'arrêt Dolkar. Il s'ensuit que le ministre prétend que M. Wanchuk avait la capacité d'obtenir la citoyenneté indienne et que, par conséquent, la décision de la Commission n'était pas déraisonnable (citant Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En outre, même si M. Wanchuk avait à obtenir une lettre de [traduction] « non-opposition » de la part de l'ACT avant de présenter une demande de citoyenneté indienne, la preuve démontrait que l'ACT donnerait son approbation.
9. Selon moi, la preuve documentaire démontre que M. Wanchuk n'avait aucun contrôle en ce qui concerne son obtention de la citoyenneté indienne:
• L'arrêt Dolkar s'applique uniquement à New Delhi; il a une certaine autorité persuasive dans les autres régions de l'Inde, mais il ne s'y applique pas.
• Aucun Tibétain ne s'est vu accorder la citoyenneté indienne dans les trois années suivant l'arrêt Dolkar.
• La position officielle de l'ACT est qu'elle ne s'opposera pas aux Tibétains qui demandent la citoyenneté indienne. Cependant, en réalité, l'ACT est hésitante à donner son approbation, car elle croit que les Tibétains en Inde devraient y rester des réfugiés, de manière à s'assurer qu'ils reviennent un jour dans un Tibet indépendant.
10. Selon moi, la preuve ne démontre qu'une simple possibilité que M. Wanchuk puisse obtenir la citoyenneté indienne. Cela nécessiterait, à tout le moins, que l'ACT exerce son pouvoir discrétionnaire de donner son approbation et que les autorités indiennes reconnaissent l'arrêt Dolkar comme étant un précédent contraignant. En fait, M. Wanchuk pourrait bien devoir porter sa cause devant les tribunaux. Je remarque que Mme Dolkar a consacré plusieurs années à des luttes administratives et juridiques en vue d'obtenir la citoyenneté indienne.
11. Dans les circonstances, je juge que la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle M. Wanchuk avait le contrôle quant à l'obtention de la citoyenneté indienne était déraisonnable.
[25]
Le juge O'Reilly n'a pas traité la question de savoir si le demandeur Wanchuk aurait à tout le moins dû tenter d'obtenir la citoyenneté.
[26]
Dans la présente affaire, le commissaire a mentionné ce qui suit au paragraphe 27 de ses motifs:
Selon le tribunal, la demandeure d'asile doit s'acquitter du fardeau d'établir qu'une demande de citoyenneté a été présentée et qu'elle a été refusée par les autorités indiennes.
[27]
Je conviens avec l'avocat de la demanderesse que rien dans le droit canadien ne prévoit qu'un demandeur doit d'abord demander la citoyenneté, puis se la faire refuser, dans un pays sûr lorsqu'il a un droit de présenter une telle demande avant de se réclamer de la protection du Canada. En fait, le juge Russell, dans la décision
Ma
, précitée, a souscrit au rejet de cette thèse par la Commission, du fait qu'il s'agissait d'un « fardeau intolérable ».
[28]
Il est néanmoins troublant de constater que, dans un cas comme celui en l'espèce, où la demanderesse était née en Inde et y menait une existence paisible, qu'elle n'a pris absolument aucune mesure pour acquérir la citoyenneté indienne complète. Certes, si elle avait entrepris des démarches raisonnables et qu'elle n'avait pas réussi à obtenir la citoyenneté, cela aurait grandement renforcé sa demande d'asile au Canada.
[29]
Avec égards au juge Russell, il n'y a rien dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> qui appuie la thèse selon laquelle il n'est pas nécessaire qu'un demandeur ait présenté une demande de citoyenneté. Le paragraphe 22 de cet arrêt traite de la question de savoir s'il relève du pouvoir, de la faculté ou du contrôle d'une personne
d'acquérir
la citoyenneté. Il n'y a rien dans cette affaire qui encourage un demandeur à ne pas déployer des efforts raisonnables pour obtenir sa citoyenneté.
[30]
La négligence volontaire, ou même la négligence, de présenter une demande de citoyenneté dans le cas où une personne a le droit de présenter une telle demande ne devrait pas constituer une invitation pour cette personne à tenter sa chance au Canada. Cela serait un bon fondement pour une question certifiée, dans l'éventualité où la question n'était pas traitée dans le cadre d'une remarque incidente. Mais, puisque c'est le cas, du fait que j'ai jugé que la conclusion selon laquelle la demanderesse avait la citoyenneté indienne était raisonnable, je ne certifierai pas la question.
4. Le commissaire aurait-il dû examiner tout élément de preuve lui permettant d'établir si la demanderesse aurait été exposée à un renvoi en Chine à partir de l'Inde?
- et -
5. Le commissaire aurait-il dû examiner la crainte de la demanderesse d'être exposée à un risque en Chine?
[31]
Étant donné que le commissaire a conclu que la demanderesse avait la citoyenneté indienne, il n'était pas nécessaire de faire un examen quant à ces questions.

[1]
Mactavish, J.
: The applicant, Rajinder Singh Dhatt, seeks judicial review of a May 23, 2012 decision by a Citizenship and Immigration Canada [CIC] officer. The officer refused Mr. Dhatt's application for permanent residence on the basis that he was inadmissible for misrepresentation pursuant to section 40 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 7 [the
Act
].
[2]
For the reasons that follow, this application for judicial review will be granted.
Facts
[3]
Mr. Dhatt is a citizen of India. He is married and has two biological children (his sons Mandeep and Sukhdeep) and one adopted daughter, Kirandeep Kaur Dhatt, who was born in 1992.
[4]
Mr. Dhatt states that he adopted Kirandeep in 1999 through a religious ceremony in his village. He states that he and his wife adopted Kirandeep with her parents' agreement, due to difficult conditions in her household and because he had no daughter. Mr. Dhatt states that even before the ceremony, Kirandeep spent a lot of time at his family's home.
[5]
In August of 2004, Mr. Dhatt obtained a birth certificate for Kirandeep from the Indian authorities. The birth certificate indicated his and his wife's names in the spaces for "Name of Father" and "Name of Mother".
[6]
At this point in time the applicant's son, Mandeep, had already applied for permanent residence in Canada. In his application form, he had identified Kirandeep as his sister.
[7]
Mr. Dhatt states that prior to his son Mandeep's departure for Canada, the family discussed the possibility of Mandeep sponsoring them. On the advice of a lawyer in India who suggested that the Canadian immigration authorities would not recognize the religious ceremony held in 1999 as a valid adoption, Mr. Dhatt and his wife obtained a formal deed of adoption from the Indian authorities. The adoption ceremony was held on February 24, 2005, and the deed of adoption was executed on April 5, 2005.
[8]
Four days after the adoption ceremony, on February 28, 2005, Mandeep landed in Canada as a permanent resident.
[9]
Following Mandeep's sponsorship application, Mr. Dhatt was asked to attend an interview at the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi. The ensuing decision is the subject of this application for judicial review.
Decision under Review
[10]
In the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System [CAIPS] entry dated October 10, 2011, the officer noted the existence of the deed of adoption for Kirandeep and observed that her birth was registered in August of 2004. The officer also noted that the birth certificate "lists [the] name of her adoptive parents".
[11]
The officer added that an interview was required "to determine whether Kirandeep's adoption comply [
sic
] with all the requirements of Hindu adoptions". Mr. Dhatt was therefore interviewed on May 7, 2012.
[12]
At the beginning of the interview, Mr. Dhatt told the officer that Kirandeep was adopted, named her natural parents, and explained that she was adopted because her natural father was ill and her parents would fight a lot. Mr. Dhatt also explained that he and his wife did not have a daughter. The officer noted that it was "unusual" that Kirandeep would be adopted at age 12.
[13]
The officer also asked Mr. Dhatt about the timing of the adoption (four days before Mandeep landed in Canada) and the fact that Mandeep indicated that Kirandeep was his sister before the formal adoption had taken place. The officer found that the applicant's answers did not allay his concerns.
[14]
The officer then confronted the applicant about the fact that Kirandeep's birth certificate must have been obtained fraudulently because it indicates that the applicant and his wife are Kirandeep's "natural parents". The officer further took issue with the fact that although the birth certificate was issued in August of 2004, allegedly in the context of a passport application, Kirandeep's passport was not issued until 2009.
[15]
The applicant admitted during the interview that Kirandeep's birth certificate had been obtained by providing false information to the Indian authorities because they were "getting the paperwork ready for [the] future".
[16]
The officer also noted that "the adoption appears to have been an adoption of convenience" given Kirandeep's age at the time of the formal ceremony and the fact that it was unlikely that her parents would have given her up simply because Mr. Dhatt and his wife did not have a daughter. The officer added that he did not find Mr. Dhatt credible as he refused to answer questions regarding the adoption.
[17]
The officer concluded that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr. Dhatt had made a material misrepresentation by submitting a fraudulent birth certificate, and that this could have led to an error in the administration of the
Act
.
[18]
By letter dated May 23, 2012, the officer advised Mr. Dhatt that he was inadmissible for misrepresentation pursuant to section 40 of the
Act
and essentially reiterated the concerns expressed in the CAIPS notes.
Issue
[19]
The issue is whether the officer reasonably concluded that Mr. Dhatt made a material misrepresentation by providing the fraudulent birth certificate, thereby rendering him inadmissible pursuant to section 40 of the
Act
.
Standard of Review
[20]
A reviewing court need not undertake a full standard of review analysis when the proper standard is well-settled by prior jurisprudence:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 62.
[21]
This Court has held that a visa officer's conclusion that an applicant has made a material misrepresentation is a question of mixed fact and law, reviewable for reasonableness:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] F.C.J. No. 912 at para. 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] F.C.J. No. 474 at para. 13.
[22]
To be reasonable, the officer's decision must be justified, transparent and intelligible, and it must fall "within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law": <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 47. Moreover, in assessing the reasonableness of a decision, the reasons must be read as a whole, together with the outcome:
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 14.
Analysis
i. Legal Framework
[23]
The officer's conclusion that the applicant was inadmissible for misrepresentation was based upon section 40 of the
Act
, the relevant portions of which read as follows:
40.
(1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible for misrepresentation
(a) for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration of this Act;
[...]
40.
(1) Emportent interdiction de territoire pour fausses déclarations les faits suivants:
a) directement ou indirectement, faire une présentation erronée sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou une réticence sur ce fait, ce qui entraîne ou risque d'entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la présente loi;
[...]
[24]
Two elements must be present for a finding of inadmissibility pursuant to section 40 of the
Act
. First, there must be a misrepresentation. Second, the misrepresentation must be material, in that it induces or could induce an error in the administration of the
Act
, or otherwise affects the process:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 572 at para. 27;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] F.C.J. No. 469 at paras. 22, 26.
[25]
This Court has held that section 40 of the
Act
is to be interpreted broadly and that applicants have a "duty of candour", which is required to maintain the integrity of the immigration system:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] F.C.J. No. 1069 at paras. 41-42;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] F.C.J. No. 737 at para. 46; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para.24.
[26]
Section 40 of the
Act
also applies to applicants who make an initial misrepresentation, even if it is subsequently clarified prior to a decision being made:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] F.C.J. No. 648 at para. 25; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 59.
[27]
An exception to this rule applies where an applicant "honestly and reasonably believed they were not misrepresenting a material fact": <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 33; see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA).
[28]
Misrepresentation under section 40 of the
Act
is also addressed in the
ENF 2 - Evaluating Inadmissibility
guidelines published by Citizenship and Immigration Canada ("the CIC Guidelines"). Although not binding, this Court has found that these Guidelines "are a good indication in a judicial review proceeding of what an immigration official might reasonably find to constitute misrepresentation of a material fact related to a relevant issue":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] F.C.J. No. 127 at para. 20.
[29]
The CIC Guidelines indicate that the purpose of section 40 of the
Act
is to ensure that those applying for entry into Canada provide "complete, honest and truthful information in every manner". The Guidelines also indicate, however, that the misrepresentation provisions must be applied with "good judgment to support the objectives of the Act and ensure fair and just decision-making": section 9.1.
[30]
Importantly, the CIC Guidelines state that the discovery of fraudulent documents "does not automatically lead to inadmissibility" because such documents "may not be material and/or ...may not induce an error in the administration of the Act". The guidelines also instruct officers to consider, amongst other things, whether the fraudulent document was provided for the purpose of making a misrepresentation: section 9.6.
ii. Application to the Present Case
[31]
The issue in the present case is whether the officer reasonably found that Mr. Dhatt made a material misrepresentation by submitting a fraudulently-obtained birth certificate for his adopted daughter, Kirandeep.
[32]
For the reasons that follow, and having regard to the broad interpretation that must be given to section 40 of the
Act
(see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 24), I find that the officer's decision was unreasonable. Simply stated, the material fact that Kirandeep was adopted was never concealed or otherwise misrepresented to the Canadian authorities.
[33]
Indeed, the deed of adoption indicating that Kirandeep had been adopted was provided to CIC at the very beginning of the application process. The information was thus available to the officer throughout the entire course of the application; there was no attempt to conceal the fact that Kirandeep was adopted:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] F.C.J. No. 1152 at para. 23. Nor was there an initial misrepresentation that Mr. Dhatt later attempted to rectify:
Khan
, above, at para. 25; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 59.
[34]
I also note that the birth certificate, though it was
obtained
fraudulently from the Indian authorities, does not specify that Mr. Dhatt and his wife are Kirandeep's biological parents. Rather, it merely lists their names under "Name of Father" and "Name of Mother".
[35]
Moreover, nothing suggests that the birth certificate was provided to the Canadian authorities for the purposes of misrepresenting his relationship with Kirandeep, or that Mr. Dhatt knew or believed he was misrepresenting material information: CIC Guidelines, section 9.6; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 33; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 15; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above.
[36]
Indeed, had Mr. Dhatt been attempting to conceal the fact that Kirandeep was adopted, logic dictates that he would not have submitted the deed of adoption as part of the application package.
[37]
A review of the CAIPS notes further indicates that during the interview, Mr. Dhatt clearly stated that Kirandeep was adopted. Notwithstanding the concerns the officer may have had regarding the circumstances or genuineness of the adoption, it cannot be said that Mr. Dhatt attempted to pass Kirandeep off as his biological daughter.
[38]
Counsel for the respondent submitted that the decision is reasonable in light of the officer's doubts as to the validity of the adoption and the fact that these doubts were the impetus for the interview to begin with.
[39]
As noted by the respondent, the officer's doubts are expressed throughout the decision. The officer finds it "unusual" that Kirandeep would have been adopted at the age of 12 and states that "the adoption appears to have been an adoption of convenience". The officer further notes that "
[e]ven if you had genuinely adopted Kirandeep
her birth certificate would include the name of her natural parents" (my emphasis). This phrasing suggests that the officer doubted the genuineness of the adoption. Finally, the officer goes so far as to state: "I do not find you [Mr. Dhatt] a credible person as you refused to answers [
sic
] questions regarding the adoption of the child".
[40]
Despite the respondent's able submissions, this argument must fail. While the concerns noted by the officer might have provided a valid basis for refusing the application, they were not the basis for the officer's decision in this case. Rather, the decision was based solely on a finding that the fraudulent birth certificate constituted a material misrepresentation.
[41]
It is also noteworthy that although the stated purpose of the interview was to verify whether the adoption complied with Hindu requirements, nowhere in the CAIPS notes or decision does the officer meaningfully engage with this issue.
[42]
As set out in section 9.6 of the CIC Guidelines, the mere fact that the birth certificate was obtained fraudulently does not, on its own, automatically lead to a finding of inadmissibility.
[43]
Considering all of the circumstances of this case, it was unreasonable for the officer to conclude that Mr. Dhatt misrepresented his relationship with Kirandeep, since there was no attempt to conceal the fact that she was adopted. The officer's finding to the contrary thus falls outside the range of possible, acceptable outcomes and must therefore be quashed: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 47,
Newfoundland  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 14.
JUDGMENT
[44]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES
that
:
1. This application for judicial review is allowed, and the matter is remitted to a different immigration officer for re-determination in accordance with these reasons.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur, Rajinder Singh Dhatt, sollicite le contrôle judiciaire de la décision rendue par un agent de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada [CIC] le 23 mai 2012. L'agent a rejeté la demande de résidence permanente présentée par M. Dhatt au motif qu'il était interdit de territoire pour fausses déclarations en application de l'article 40 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, L.C. 2001, c. 7 [la Loi].
[2]
Pour les motifs qui suivent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire sera accueillie.
Faits
[3]
M. Dhatt est un citoyen de l'Inde. Il est marié et il a deux enfants biologiques (ses fils Mandeep et Sukhdeep) et une fille adoptée, Kirandeep Kaur Dhatt, née en 1992.
[4]
M. Dhatt déclare avoir adopté Kirandeep en 1999 lors d'une cérémonie religieuse dans son village. Il affirme que son épouse et lui ont adopté Kirandeep avec l'accord des parents de la fillette, en raison du climat difficile dans son foyer d'origine, et parce que le demandeur n'avait pas de fille. Selon M. Dhatt, Kirandeep passait beaucoup de temps chez lui, même avant la cérémonie.
[5]
En août 2004, M. Dhatt a obtenu l'acte de naissance de Kirandeep auprès des autorités indiennes. Les noms du demandeur et de son épouse figuraient sur l'acte de naissance aux lignes « Nom du père » et « Nom de la mère ».
[6]
À l'époque, l'un des fils du demandeur, Mandeep, avait déjà fait une demande de résidence permanente au Canada. Dans son formulaire de demande, il avait identifié Kirandeep comme sa sœur.
[7]
M. Dhatt affirme que, peu avant le départ de Mandeep pour le Canada, la famille avait discuté de la possibilité que le fils les parraine. Suivant les conseils d'un avocat en Inde qui avait déclaré que les autorités en immigration du Canada ne considéreraient peut-être pas la cérémonie religieuse tenue en 1999 comme une procédure d'adoption valide, M. Dhatt et son épouse ont obtenu un acte d'adoption officiel auprès des autorités indiennes. La cérémonie d'adoption s'est tenue le 24 février 2005, et l'acte d'adoption a été signé le 5 avril 2005.
[8]
Quatre jours après la cérémonie d'adoption, le 28 février 2005, Mandeep a été admis au Canada.
[9]
Après la demande de parrainage de Mandeep, M. Dhatt a été convoqué en entrevue au Haut-commissariat du Canada à New Delhi. La décision qui a suivi est l'objet de la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire.
Décision contrôlée
[10]
Dans l'entrée du Système de traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration [STIDI] datée du 10 octobre 2011, l'agent a fait état de l'existence de l'acte d'adoption de Kirandeep et noté que la naissance de celle-ci avait été enregistrée en août 2004. L'agent a également constaté que [traduction] « les noms de ses parents adoptifs » figuraient sur l'acte de naissance.
[11]
L'agent a ajouté qu'il était nécessaire de ménager une entrevue [traduction] « pour déterminer si l'adoption de Kirandeep respect[ait] toutes les exigences de la loi hindoue en matière d'adoption ». M. Dhatt a donc été interrogé le 7 mai 2012.
[12]
Au début de l'entrevue, M. Dhatt a dit à l'agent que Kirandeep avait été adoptée, il a donné le nom de ses parents biologiques et expliqué qu'elle avait été adoptée parce que son père biologique était malade et que ses parents se disputaient beaucoup. M. Dhatt a également précisé que son épouse et lui n'avaient pas de fille. L'agent a constaté qu'il était [traduction] « curieux » que Kirandeep ait été adoptée à l'âge de 12 ans.
[13]
L'agent a également interrogé M. Dhatt au sujet du moment de l'adoption (quatre jours avant que Mandeep n'arrive au Canada) et du fait que Mandeep avait indiqué que Kirandeep était sa sœur avant même que l'adoption officielle n'ait eu lieu. L'agent a constaté que les réponses du demandeur ne dissipaient pas ses doutes.
[14]
L'agent a ensuite fait observer au demandeur que l'acte de naissance de Kirandeep devait avoir été obtenu de façon frauduleuse, car il y était inscrit que le demandeur et son épouse étaient les [traduction] « parents biologiques » de Kirandeep. L'agent a également relevé le fait que l'acte de naissance avait été délivré en août 2004, prétendument dans le cadre d'une demande de passeport, alors que le passeport de Kirandeep n'avait été délivré qu'en 2009.
[15]
Le demandeur a admis durant l'entrevue que l'acte de naissance de Kirandeep avait été obtenu sur présentation de faux renseignements aux autorités indiennes parce qu'ils [traduction] « préparaient leurs documents pour l'avenir ».
[16]
L'agent a également constaté que [traduction] « l'adoption sembl[ait] avait été une adoption de complaisance », vu l'âge de Kirandeep au moment de la cérémonie officielle, et qu'il était peu probable que ses parents l'aient donnée en adoption simplement parce que M. Dhatt et son épouse n'avaient pas de fille. L'agent a ajouté que M. Dhatt ne lui apparaissait pas crédible, car il refusait de répondre aux questions relatives à l'adoption.
[17]
L'agent a conclu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, M. Dhatt avait fait une présentation erronée sur un fait important en soumettant un faux acte de naissance, ce qui aurait pu entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la Loi.
[18]
Dans une lettre datée du 23 mai 2012, l'agent a informé M. Dhatt du fait qu'il était interdit de territoire pour fausses déclarations en application de l'article 40 de la Loi et il a essentiellement réitéré les préoccupations soulevées dans les notes consignées au STIDI.
Question en litige
[19]
La question est de savoir si l'agent a conclu de façon raisonnable que M. Dhatt avait fait une présentation erronée sur un fait important en produisant un faux acte de naissance, ce qui le rend interdit de territoire conformément à l'article 40 de la Loi.
Norme de contrôle
[20]
Une cour de révision n'a pas besoin d'entreprendre une analyse exhaustive concernant la norme de contrôle lorsque la jurisprudence antérieure établit clairement la norme qu'il convient d'appliquer:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] 1 R.C. S. 190, au paragraphe 62.
[21]
La Cour fédérale a statué que la conclusion d'un agent des visas selon laquelle un demandeur a fait une présentation erronée sur un fait important est une question mixte de fait et de droit, susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] A.C.F. no 912, au paragraphe 14;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] A.C.F. no 474, au paragraphe 13.
[22]
Pour être raisonnable, la décision de l'agent doit être justifiable, transparente et intelligible et doit « apparten[ir] [...] aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit »: voir l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47. De plus, pour savoir si une décision est raisonnable, les motifs doivent être examinés dans leur ensemble, en corrélation avec le résultat:
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 14.
Analyse
i - Cadre législatif
[23]
La conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle le demandeur était interdit de territoire pour fausses déclarations reposait sur l'article 40 de la Loi, dont voici les passages pertinents:
40.
(1) Emportent interdiction de territoire pour fausses déclarations les faits suivants:
a) directement ou indirectement, faire une présentation erronée sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent, ou une réticence sur ce fait, ce qui entraîne ou risque d'entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la présente loi;
[...]
40.
(1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible for misrepresentation
(a) for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration of this Act;
[...]
[24]
Deux éléments doivent être présents pour qu'il soit conclu à l'interdiction de territoire selon l'article 40 de la Loi. Premièrement, il doit y avoir une présentation erronée sur un fait. Deuxièmement, la présentation erronée doit porter sur un fait important, ce qui entraîne ou risque d'entraîner une erreur dans l'application de la Loi, ou a une incidence sur le processus amorcé:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] A.C.F. no 572, au paragraphe 27;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] A.C.F. no 469, aux paragraphes 22 et 26.
[25]
La Cour fédérale a statué que l'article 40 de la Loi doit être interprété dans un sens large et que les demandeurs ont une « obligation de franchise », laquelle est nécessaire pour préserver l'intégrité du régime d'immigration:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] A.C.F. no 1069, aux paragraphes 41 et 42;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] A.C.F. no 737, au paragraphe 46; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 24.
[26]
L'article 40 de la Loi s'applique également aux demandeurs qui font initialement une fausse déclaration, même s'ils la clarifient ensuite avant qu'une décision soit rendue:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] A.C.F. no 648, au paragraphe 25; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 59.
[27]
Une exception à cette règle s'applique dans les cas où un demandeur « pensait honnêtement et raisonnablement qu'il ne faisait pas une présentation erronée sur un fait important »: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 33; voir aussi
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF).
[28]
Les lignes directrices du chapitre
ENF 2 - Évaluation de l'interdiction de territoire
, publié par Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada (les lignes directrices de CIC), traitent aussi des fausses déclarations au sens de l'article 40 de la Loi. Même si ces lignes directrices ne sont pas contraignantes, la Cour a conclu qu'elles « donnent une bonne indication, dans le cadre d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, de ce qu'un agent d'immigration pourrait raisonnablement considérer comme une présentation erronée sur un fait important quant à un objet pertinent »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] A.C.F. no 127, au paragraphe 20.
[29]
Selon les lignes directrices de CIC, les dispositions de l'article 40 de la Loi visent à ce que les demandeurs donnent « des renseignements honnêtes, complets et véridiques en tout point dans leurs demandes d'entrée au Canada ». Elles précisent toutefois que les dispositions concernant les fausses déclarations doivent être appliquées « avec discernement pour respecter les objectifs de la Loi et garantir un processus décisionnel juste et équitable »: section 9.1.
[30]
Fait à noter, les lignes directrices de CIC mentionnent que la découverte de faux documents n'entraîne « pas automatiquement une interdiction de territoire », car ces documents « ne répondent peut-être pas aux critères d'importance [...] et/ou n'entraînent peut-être pas une erreur dans l'application de la Loi ». Les lignes directrices imposent également aux agents de déterminer, entre autres choses, si le document frauduleux a été fourni dans le but de faire une fausse déclaration: section 9.6.
ii. Application en l'espèce
[31]
La question à trancher en l'espèce est de savoir si l'agent a eu raison de conclure que M. Dhatt avait fait une présentation erronée sur un fait important en présentant un acte de naissance obtenu frauduleusement pour sa fille adoptée, Kirandeep.
[32]
Pour les raisons qui suivent, et compte tenu de l'interprétation large qu'il convient de donner de l'article 40 de la Loi (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 24), je conclus que la décision de l'agent était déraisonnable. Le fait important, à savoir que Kirandeep a été adoptée, n'a jamais été dissimulé ou faussement présenté aux autorités canadiennes.
[33]
En effet, l'acte d'adoption établissant que Kirandeep a été adoptée avait été fourni à CIC au tout début du processus de demande. L'agent disposait donc de ce renseignement tout au long du processus de demande; personne n'avait tenté de dissimuler le fait que Kirandeep avait été adoptée:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] A.C.F. no 1152, au paragraphe 23. Il n'y avait pas non plus eu de fausse déclaration initiale que M. Dhatt aurait ensuite tenté de clarifier:
Khan
, précité, au paragraphe 25; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 59.
[34]
Je constate également que l'acte de naissance, certes
obtenu
frauduleusement auprès des autorités indiennes, n'indique toutefois pas que M. Dhatt et son épouse sont les parents biologiques de Kirandeep. Leurs noms apparaissent seulement aux lignes « Nom du père » et « Nom de la mère ».
[35]
Qui plus est, rien ne permet de croire que M. Dhatt avait fourni l'acte de naissance aux autorités canadiennes afin de présenter de manière inexacte sa relation avec Kirandeep, ni qu'il savait ou croyait qu'il faisait une présentation erronée sur un fait important: lignes directrices de CIC, section 9.6; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 33; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 15; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité.
[36]
En toute logique, M. Dhatt n'aurait pas joint l'acte d'adoption à son dossier de demande s'il avait tenté de dissimuler le fait que Kirandeep avait été adoptée.
[37]
L'examen des notes du STIDI montre que M. Dhatt a dit clairement durant l'entrevue que Kirandeep avait été adoptée. Malgré les doutes que l'agent peut avoir quant aux circonstances ou à l'authenticité de l'adoption, on ne saurait affirmer que M. Dhatt a tenté de faire passer Kirandeep pour sa fille biologique.
[38]
L'avocate du défendeur a déclaré que la décision est raisonnable compte tenu des doutes de l'agent quant à la validité de l'adoption et du fait que ces doutes étaient à l'origine de la convocation en entrevue.
[39]
Comme le défendeur l'a fait remarquer, l'agent exprime ses doutes tout au long de la décision. L'agent estime qu'il est [traduction] « curieux » que Kirandeep ait été adoptée à l'âge de 12 ans et soutient que [traduction] « l'adoption semble avoir été une adoption de complaisance ». L'agent affirme aussi: [traduction] «
[q] uand bien même vous auriez véritablement adopté Kirandeep
, le nom de ses parents biologiques figurerait sur son acte de naissance » (les italiques sont de moi). La formulation de la phrase laisse penser que l'agent doutait de l'authenticité de l'adoption. Enfin, il va jusqu'à déclarer: [traduction] « Vous [M. Dhatt] ne m'apparaissez pas comme une personne crédible, car vous avez refusé de répondre aux questions portant sur l'adoption de l'enfant. »
[40]
Malgré l'argumentation solide du défendeur, cet argument doit être rejeté. Les préoccupations soulevées par l'agent auraient pu constituer un fondement valable du refus de la demande; or, ce n'est pas sur elles que la décision de l'agent reposait en l'espèce. Elle était plutôt seulement fondée sur la conclusion que l'acte de naissance frauduleux constituait une présentation erronée sur un fait important.
[41]
En outre, alors que l'objet déclaré de l'entrevue était de vérifier si l'adoption respectait les exigences de la loi hindoue, l'agent ne traite de cette question nulle part dans les notes du STIDI et dans la décision.
[42]
Comme il est énoncé dans la section 9.6 des lignes directrices de CIC, le simple fait que l'acte de naissance a été obtenu frauduleusement n'entraîne pas automatiquement une interdiction de territoire.
[43]
Compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances en l'espèce, il était déraisonnable de la part de l'agent de conclure que M. Dhatt a fait une présentation erronée de sa relation avec Kirandeep, puisqu'il n'a pas tenté de dissimuler le fait qu'elle avait été adoptée. La conclusion contraire de l'agent n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables et doit donc être annulée: arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47; arrêt

 Summary: 
 
 A refugee claimant applied for judicial review of a decision of an immigration tribunal. The issues were whether the tribunal failed to observe a principle of natural justice or procedural fairness by not giving the refugee claimant an opportunity to reply to new case law and whether it ignored relevant evidence that the claimant could not return to Colombo as an internal flight alternative. 
 
 
 
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, allowed the application, set aside the tribunal's decision, and referred the matter back for redetermination by a different panel.

  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
                                                                                                      
 
 
 
 [1] McKeown, J. 
 : The issues are whether the Board failed to observe a principle of natural justice or procedural fairness by not giving the applicant an opportunity to reply to new case law and whether it ignored relevant evidence that the applicant could not return to Colombo as an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA). 
 
 
 
 [2] 
  The failure to provide the parties an opportunity to deal with new case law is a matter which has been dealt with on a case by case basis until now. I have decided in the circumstances of this case it is contrary to procedural fairness. There may be cases where there would not be denial of procedural fairness when a Board relied on a case decided after the hearing and submissions before the Board were completed and before the Board rendered its decision. This question should be reviewed by an appeal court to enable the court to determine if this question should be dealt with on a general basis or a case by case basis. 
 
 
 
 [3] 
  In the case before me the Board relied on a Federal Court of Appeal decision,  
 Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 334; 18 Imm. L.R.(2d) 130 (application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed without reasons August 5, 1993 (Court File No. 23442)). After a short review of the history, in the portion of the reasons entitled "Analysis" the Board examined whether the applicant had good grounds to fear persecution based upon the existence of sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence as to why the applicant did not seek the protection of his government. The Board concluded no such evidence was provided, and in the next sentence in the same paragraph referred to the Federal Court of Appeal decision  
 Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  showing that one is not able to avail oneself of the protection of one's own state is not easily satisfied. The test is an objective one and involves the claimant showing either that he is physically prevented from seeking his government's aid (clearly not the case here) or that the government itself is in some way prevented from giving it. 
 
 
 
 "No government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can  
 guarantee 
  the protection of all of its citizens at all times. Thus, it is not enough for a claimant merely to show that his government has not always been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation. Terrorism in the name of one warped ideology or another is a scourge afflicting many societies today; its victims, however much they merit our sympathy, do not become convention refugees simply because their governments have been unable to suppres [sic] the evil ... where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection." 
 
 
 
 [4] 
  This is the only case cited by the Board. Subsequent to the Board's decision there are two further cases which clarified  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , further:  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 1 and  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). The respondent submitted that  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , had clarified the existing common law on the issue of the burden of showing that one is not able to avail oneself of the protection of one's own state is not easily satisfied. Furthermore, the  
 Villafranca 
  case involved an agent of the state as claimant and this distinction was not commented on by the Board. Under the unusual circumstances set out herein it was contrary to procedural fairness to deny the applicant the right to make submissions on  
 Villafranca 
 . 
 
 
 
 [5] 
  Furthermore, on the IFA, the Board should have reviewed the applicant's evidence regarding his fears of residing in Colombo. There is no clear finding as to credibility. This evidence can be categorized as ignored. The Board's decision in this respect is an error of law because relevant evidence was ignored.  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). 
 
 
 
 [6] 
  The decision of the Board dated April 1, 1993 is set aside and the matter is referred back to the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board for determination of the applicant's claim to be a Convention refugee by a different panel in accordance with the reasons herein. 
 
 
 
 Application allowed.

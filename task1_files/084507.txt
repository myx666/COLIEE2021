 Summary: 
 
 In May 1992, the plaintiff, a Newfoundland fisherman, leased the defendant motor vessel, the "Tami Joan", from Lord. When the plaintiff took possession of the vessel, it was subject to a mortgage held by the New Brunswick Fisheries Development Board as mortgagee. The mortgage went into default. In October 1992 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Brunswick as represented by the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, took possession of the vessel. Thereafter, the plaintiff sued the Minister for, inter alia, wrongfully taking the vessel without notice and for failing to account for improvements made to the vessel by the plaintiff. The Minister, after filing a defence to the in rem action, sought an order striking out the Minister as a defendant and striking out the portions of the claim that sought relief against the Minister et al. The plaintiff sought an order adding MacFarlane, an employee of the province of New Brunswick, as a party to the action.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 The Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, allowed the Minister's application and dismissed the plaintiff's application.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>

 MacKay, J. 
 : These two applications came on for hearing at Fredericton on April 11, 1996. By application filed March 6, 1996 the second defendant, Her Majesty in right of New Brunswick represented by the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, sought an order granting leave to file a conditional appearance in her capacity as a second defendant to challenge the jurisdiction of the court and an order striking out Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Brunswick as represented by the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture as a defendant and striking out portions of the statement of claim which seek relief against the Minister, Her Majesty in right of New Brunswick and her servants, employees or agents in personam. The plaintiff, by application sought an order adding Michael MacFarlane as a defendant to the action and amending the statement of claim accordingly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [2] 
  At the hearing of these matters, I issued two orders in which I granted the defendant's application and dismissed the application brought on behalf of the plaintiff. These are written reasons for those orders, now filed in accord with s. 51 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [3] 
  The plaintiff is a fisherman residing in the Province of Newfoundland. On approximately May 22, 1992 he entered into a charterparty with Lawrence Ralph Lord for lease of the defendant motor vessel, the "Tami Joan", for the period from May 15, 1992 to December 25, 1992. He paid Mr. Lord $35,000 plus GST under the charterparty and was given possession of the vessel. At the time the plaintiff took possession, the vessel was subject to a mortgage held by the Fisheries Development Board of the Province of New Brunswick as mortgagee.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [4] 
  While in possession of the vessel the plaintiff claims to have made various improvements and installed equipment. During the time the vessel was in his possession, the mortgage held against it went into default. On October 26, 1992 the defendant Her Majesty in right of the Province of New Brunswick as represented by the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture (the "Minister"), through authorized agents, took possession of the vessel and all equipment on it, at St. John's, Newfoundland.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [5] 
  Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a statement of claim on November 12, 1992 alleging that the Minister wrongfully took possession of the vessel without notice and in a high-handed manner, by calling the plaintiff to a meeting and taking possession of the vessel while he was in attendance at the meeting. In addition, the plaintiff submits that the Minister has failed to account for the improvements and equipment on the vessel which are owned by him. By the statement of claim the plaintiff seeks an order declaring that he is entitled to possession of the vessel, and that he is entitled to a possessory maritime lien in priority to all other claims against the defendant vessel, and he also claims damages, including special, general and punitive damages against the second defendant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [6] 
  A first defendant, Mr. Lord, as owner of all 64 shares in the vessel, filed a statement of defence which claims that by the charterparty the plaintiff undertook to pay him a total of $75,000 plus GST, with $35,000 plus GST being paid upon delivery of the vessel and the balance paid in monthly instalments of $10,000 plus GST, commencing July 31, 1992 until the total amount due was paid. Mr. Lord claims that the charterparty also provided that the plaintiff is responsible for keeping the vessel in good repair and in the same condition in which it was received, and that the plaintiff is liable for all loss and damage to the vessel. In addition, it is said that the plaintiff had a duty to maintain insurance, and to pay solicitor and other costs in connection with repossession and collection of sums due by the plaintiff to Mr. Lord. Mr. Lord states that the plaintiff undertook to make the first payment under the charterparty, due July 31, 1992, directly to the mortgagee, but failed to do so, which resulted in seizure of the vessel. By statement of defence and counterclaim Mr. Lord claims the balance of amounts owing under the charterparty and possession of the vessel, as well as costs associated with insuring and returning the vessel, a possessory maritime lien and damages.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [7] 
  The Minister filed a statement of defence and counterclaim on February 12, 1993 on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of New Brunswick as a First defendant, a person interested in the motor vessel "Tami Joan" by virtue of the mortgage held by the provincial Fisheries Development Board. In the defence it is explicitly stated that Her Majesty is defending the action only in her capacity as a first defendant, and only insofar as the action is one in rem against the vessel. The Minister, in the statement of defence and counterclaim, claims that under the terms of the mortgage, the mortgagor, or any person claiming under the mortgagor, is not permitted to land or sell fish outside of the Province of New Brunswick without the approval of the Minister, which the plaintiff did not here seek. The defence maintains the vessel "Tami Joan" was contacted by radio on May 24, 1992 through the Canadian Coast Guard, while she was at sea, and the vessel was requested to sail to the nearest port; persons on the vessel agreed, but failed to then follow the instruction and thereafter failed to respond to subsequent calls made on standard calling frequencies. The vessel was subsequently sailed to Newfoundland.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [8] 
  In Her Majesty's statement of defence and counterclaim as a first defendant it is claimed that on June 4, 1992 the plaintiff was contacted by a representative of the Province of New Brunswick, Mr. MacFarlane, and advised of the mortgage held against the vessel and that the mortgage was then in default and the vessel was, as a result, liable to seizure. In the view of the Minister by October 26, 1992, the date of seizure, the plaintiff had constructively abandoned the vessel in that he had failed to pay insurance on the vessel, had tied up the vessel "at the Port of St. John" (presumably it was intended to say "St. John's" where the vessel was seized) for a prolonged period of time without payment of wharfage fees or port tariffs. Further, it is alleged the plaintiff had ceased making payments to Mr. Lord, had foregone an available fishery and had ceased to maintain and occupy the vessel.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [9] 
  The Minister alleges that the plaintiff was called to the vessel on October 26, 1992 and was invited to remove his personal belongings, which he declined to do, stating to Mr. MacFarlane, among others, that he had no more equipment on board. The Minister claims that he is willing to deliver the remainder of the plaintiff's belongings on request, but that most of the improvements alleged by the plaintiff to have been made could not be located on the vessel. In the counterclaim, which was subsequently withdrawn, the Minister claimed the expenses incurred in seizing and selling the vessel.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [10] 
  On April 5, 1993 the plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to rule 324 seeking to add Mr. MacFarlane as a defendant to this action. By Order dated April 29, 1993 my colleague Mr. Justice Denault ordered that the application is not a matter that should be disposed of without personal appearance by the parties. Thereafter the plaintiff filed the application now before the court to add Mr. MacFarlane as a defendant. On March 6, 1996, the Minister filed the other application now before the court, to enter a conditional appearance to challenge the jurisdiction of the court in relation to the second defendant, Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Brunswick as represented by the Minister, and striking portions of the statement of claim. I deal with the latter application first in the balance of these Reasons.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [11] 
  On behalf of the Minister it is submitted that this court does not have jurisdiction over Her Majesty in right of a Province. It is urged that the jurisdiction of the Federal Court extends only to actions involving the Crown in right of Canada and, consequently, any allegations in the statement of claim claiming a remedy against Her Majesty in right of New Brunswick in personam must be struck.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [12] 
  The Minister submits that s. 17 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , as set out below, provides the Federal Court with jurisdiction over actions against the Crown in certain circumstances:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "17(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Act or any other Act of Parliament, the Trial Division has concurrent original jurisdiction in all cases where relief is claimed against the Crown. ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 The term "Crown" is defined in s. 2 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  as meaning "Her Majesty in right of Canada". The applicant Minister submits that the word "Crown" as found in s. 17, can only mean Her Majesty in right of Canada by virtue of s. 2, and jurisdiction in a claim against the Crown does not extend to Her Majesty in right of a Province.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [13] 
  In the view of the Minister the plaintiff implicitly acknowledged that the Federal Court lacked jurisdiction to determine the claim against Her Majesty in right of the Province or against him, in personam, for the plaintiff failed to serve the statement of claim on him and had served only the vessel itself in connection with the proceedings in rem against the first defendants.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [14] 
  In addition, the Minister maintains that Her Majesty has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the court by filing a statement of defence and counterclaim. Rather, it is said, those documents were filed in her capacity as a first defendant, a mortgagee interested in the "Tami Joan", and were in response to the in rem proceedings initiated against the owners and all others interested in the vessel. The Minister specifically disputed the plaintiff's ability to bring the action in personam. Moreover, it is said, even if Her Majesty, or her Minister were considered to have submitted to the court's jurisdiction, the court would still not have jurisdiction under the  
 Federal Court Act 
  to determine a claim in personam against Her Majesty, or her Minister acting in his capacity as a Minister of the Province.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [15] 
  In the Minister's submission, paragraphs 3, 6, 7, 9(d), 9(e) and 9(f) as well as reference to Her Majesty in the title of the proceedings should be struck on the basis that the court does not have jurisdiction over Her Majesty in right of a Province. Those paragraphs provide:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "3. The second defendant is represented by the Minister of the Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture of the Province of New Brunswick, and the Fisheries Development Board of the said Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "6. On the 26th day of October 1992 the Second defendant by its authorized agents wrongfully and without notice interfered with the plaintiff's lawful possession of the defendant ship and with the plaintiff's right to use of same by taking possession of the defendant ship and all equipment thereon at St. John's, in the Province of Newfoundland and by causing the defendant ship to be sailed to the port of Fermeuse, Newfoundland whereupon the Second defendant converted the defendant ship and the equipment, supplies and improvements to its own use and deprived the plaintiff of his lawful possession and use of the defendant Ship.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "7. The plaintiff states that the Action of the Second defendant in taking possession of the defendant Ship was highhanded and oppressive in that the taking thereof was planned and deliberate and without notice to the plaintiff in that the Second defendant by its Agents caused the plaintiff to be called to a meeting with the Second defendant's Agent in relation to the vessel which meeting was set for 2:00 p.m. October 26th, 1992, and upon the plaintiff's attendance for the meeting and his consequent absence from the vessel, the Second defendant surreptitiously and deceitfully by its Agents caused locks on the vessel to be broken open and the vessel to be forcefully entered and put under way. The plaintiff states that the Actions of the Second defendant were highhanded, oppressive, deceitful and violent and justify an award of punitive damages.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "9. The plaintiff states that by virtue of the supply of the equipment, supplies and improvements to the said vessel and his lawful possession of the said vessel the plaintiff is entitled to a possessory maritime lien on the said vessel in priority to any claim or purported claim of the Second defendant. AND the plaintiff claims as follows:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 . . . . .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (d) Damages in relation to the equipment, supplies and improvements converted by the Second defendant to its own use - $35,777;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (e) Special and general damages against the Second defendant respecting loss of use of the defendant Vessel for the period October 26th, 1992 - December 25th, 1992;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 (f) Punitive damages against the Second defendant; ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [16] 
  On behalf of the plaintiff it is submitted that the Minister was not served with the statement of claim because jurisdictional issues were being raised and it was decided to delay service. The plaintiff submits that once a person appears in an action in rem, that person is in the same position as if he or she had been brought before the court by personal notice. Thus, it is said, that by defending and filing a counterclaim, the Minister here has responded on behalf of Her Majesty to the statement of claim in personam and has submitted to the jurisdiction of the court. In addition, it is said that Her Majesty accepted all of the provisions for relief under the  
 Federal Court Act 
  by filing the counterclaim, though admittedly that counterclaim has since been withdrawn.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [17] 
  For the plaintiff it is also submitted that this court has jurisdiction over maritime matters under the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , whether in rem or in personam, and, as a result, this court has jurisdiction to determine the action brought, including the claims for relief, against the Minister, in personam. The improvements made and equipment purchased, in the plaintiff's view constitute a claim for necessaries, and thus bring the action within the ambit of maritime law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [18] 
  In my view, the court does not have jurisdiction to grant relief against Her Majesty in right of a Province. I am persuaded that by limiting the definition of the Crown in s. 2, it was intended that an action brought pursuant to s. 17 could only be brought as against Her Majesty in right of Canada, and the possibility of bringing an action against Her Majesty in right of a Province was implicitly excluded. In  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), where the appellant had named the Queen in right of the Province of British Columbia as a respondent, Mr Justice Thurlow stated:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "The jurisdiction of the Federal Court is entirely statutory and, accepting that it lies within the powers of the Parliament of Canada, when legislating in a field within its competence, to give the Federal Court jurisdiction to implead the Crown in right of a province, we do not think any of the statutory provisions to which we were referred, or any others of which we are aware, authorize the court to entertain a proceeding at the suit of a subject against the Crown in right of a province. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 [19] 
  In addition, Mr. Justice Jackett for the Court of Appeal, in determining whether an action could be maintained against Her Majesty in Right of Newfoundland, stated in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In my view, it is clear law that the Crown cannot be impleaded in a court in respect of a claim against the Crown except where statutory jurisdiction has been conferred on the court to entertain claims against the Crown of a class in which the particular claim falls. ...  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "Reading the  
 Federal Court Act 
  as a whole and s. 23 in particular, I am satisfied that that statute is not so framed as to confer jurisdiction in respect of a claim by an individual or a corporation against Her Majesty in right of Newfoundland. This, in my view, flows from the rule of interpretation in s. 16 of the  
 Interpretation Act 
  read with the definition of 'Her Majesty' in s. 28 thereof. Those provisions read:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 '16. No enactment is binding on Her Majesty or affects Her Majesty or Her Majesty's rights or prerogatives in any manner, except only as therein mentioned or referred to.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 '28. In every enactment  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 '"Her Majesty", "His Majesty", "the Queen", "the King" or "the Crown" means the Sovereign of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories, and Head of the Commonwealth;'  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "It is worthy of note that, where the  
 Federal Court Act 
  contemplates conferring jurisdiction in claims against Her Majesty, it does so (e.g. s. 17(1)) by express reference to claims against the 'Crown', which is defined for purposes of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , by s. 2 thereof as 'Her Majesty in right of Canada'. ... <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 
 Similarly, it was found that the Federal Court did not have jurisdiction over an action brought against Her Majesty in right of a Province in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [20] 
  In my opinion, the plaintiff's submission that the Minister representing Her Majesty in right of New Brunswick has submitted to the jurisdiction of this court by filing a statement of defence and counterclaim is not well-founded. The Minister clearly indicates the Province is defending and was counterclaiming only in its capacity as an owner or other person interested in the ship "Tami Joan", i.e., in its role as mortgagee of the vessel. Moreover, in my view, even if the Minister were considered to submit to the jurisdiction of this court in his capacity as a Minister of the Province, that could not extend the court's jurisdiction, which, it is well settled, is defined by statute. Here Parliament has implicitly precluded the court from exercising jurisdiction over Her Majesty in right of a Province; it may not then exercise jurisdiction over one of Her Majesty's Ministers acting in his or her official capacity on behalf of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [21] 
  I am also not persuaded that this court has jurisdiction over the proceedings for relief in personam against a Minister or an agent of a Province, by virtue of its jurisdiction over maritime law under the  
 Federal Court Act 
 . The question of whether this court has jurisdiction over a particular subject matter is separate from the question of whether the court has jurisdiction over a particular party.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [22] 
   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  initiated against the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia, as well as the Council of Maritime Premiers and the Land Registration and Information Service, agencies created by those provinces. In doing so, he stated, inter alia, (at p. 176 F.C.):  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 "In my opinion, the mere fact that the Federal Court has concurrent jurisdiction with provincial courts to hear and determine civil actions for copyright infringement is insufficient to vest the court with jurisdiction to entertain the present suit impleading the provincial Crowns and the Crown agencies named as defendants in the absence of some specific provision to that effect, whether contained in federal legislation or in the respective Crown proceedings statutes of the three provinces. I concur with the reasoning of Collier, J., in  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  this court, there must, ... be some legislative provision permitting suits', and here there is none. I am also of the opinion that the traditional immunity of the provincial Crowns and their agencies from suits in the Federal Court is not abrogated in the present case by the general descriptions of subject matter of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to copyright contained in the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , on the principle of  
  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  MacFarlane as a defendant to the action. The plaintiff submits that a servant of the Crown can be found liable for any wrongdoing on his or her part, and is not immune from being sued. Thus, in the plaintiff's view, Mr. MacFarlane, a servant or agent of the Province of New Brunswick, is accountable before this court for wrongdoings alleged by the statement of claim to have been committed by him. In addition, the plaintiff alleges that the illegal seizure of a vessel, as is here alleged, is an admiralty matter, and thus within this court's jurisdiction.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [24] 
  For the Minister it is said that this is not an issue of Crown immunity but, rather, is an issue involving the court's jurisdiction. The Minister submits that a claim against an officer or servant of the Crown must be supported by existing and applicable federal legislation. In the Minister's view, the plaintiff may be able to bring an action in tort against Mr. MacFarlane in a provincial court. However, it is said, s. 17 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  does not permit an action against a provincial Crown servant. The Minister submits that Mr. MacFarlane was at all times acting within the scope of his duties as a servant of the provincial Crown and that by attempting to initiate proceedings against Mr. MacFarlane the plaintiff is attempting to do indirectly what cannot be done directly, that is, to sue Her Majesty in right of a Province.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [25] 
  In my view, Mr. MacFarlane would not be a proper defendant in this action. Insofar as he was acting within the scope of his duties, his liability is governed by the provincial law of New Brunswick and insofar as he may have been acting outside of those duties, the plaintiff may have an action in tort. In my opinion, claims of either of those matters fall within provincial jurisdiction and are outside of this court's authority.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [26] 
  It is urged that interference with possession of a ship is a matter within the admiralty jurisdiction of this court but I am not persuaded this is so in the circumstances here where the alleged interference took place while the vessel was moored at dockside in St. John's. I do not consider redress for the alleged interference with the vessel by Mr. MacFarlane to be in the nature of a maritime claim; rather, in my view the allegations are in the nature of tort, a matter which, in claims between one person, the plaintiff, and another, Mr. MacFarlane, lies within the jurisdiction of a provincial court. It is well settled that a claim against a provincial government employee for alleged wrong done within the scope of his provincial duties may be pursued in the courts of the province concerned, insofar as provincial legislation may permit. If the claim be one for wrongdoing not within his or her responsibilities, the claim is in tort, to be heard in the courts of the province where the wrong occurred or perhaps where the alleged wrongdoer may be found.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [27] 
  For these reasons, at the conclusion of the hearing an order issued granting the Minister leave to file a conditional appearance, removing Her Majesty in Right of New Brunswick (represented by the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Fisheries Development Board, of the Province of New Brunswick) as a Second defendant in the action; and amending the style of cause to read as it appears at the commencement of these reasons. Further, that order directed that paragraphs 3, 6 and 7 and subparagraphs (d), (e) and (f) of the plaintiff's claim for relief, following paragraph 9, are struck from the Statement of Claim filed November 12, 1992, without prejudice to further amendments the plaintiff may seek to effect to fully present his claim against the vessel, her owners and all others interested in the "Tami Joan".  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [28] 
  A second order issued dismissing the plaintiff's application to add Mr. MacFarlane as a defendant for the reasons here set out.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 [29] 
  Neither order made provision for costs, which were not requested, and those remain in the cause.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  
 Order accordingly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>
